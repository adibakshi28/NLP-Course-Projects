and open market operations. 
Developments in Financial Markets and Open 
Market Operations 
The manager of the System Open Market Account 
(SOMA) reported on developments in domestic and for-
eign financial markets, including expectations of market 
participants for monetary policy action by the Federal 
Open Market Committee (FOMC) at this meeting and 
in the future.  The deputy manager followed with a brief-
ing on money market developments and System open 
market operations conducted by the Open Market Desk 
during the period since the Committee met on Octo-
ber 27–28.  It was noted that the System’s reverse repur-
chase (RRP) agreement operations continued to provide 
a soft floor under short-term interest rates.  The deputy 
manager also discussed plans to publish additional infor-
mation on details of the Committee’s current Treasury 
securities reinvestment policy.  The manager then 
briefed the Committee on several other matters, includ-
ing plans to begin publishing the effective federal funds 
rate and a broader overnight bank funding rate based on 
the Report of Selected Money Market Rates (FR 2420) 
in early March 2016; the possibility that the Federal Re-
serve, in cooperation with the Office of Financial Re-
search, might publish a reference rate for overnight 
transactions collateralized by Treasury securities; and the 
staff’s ongoing review of the readiness of various Desk 
operations and facilities. 
By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s 
domestic transactions over the intermeeting period.  
There were no intervention operations in foreign curren-
cies for the System’s account over the intermeeting pe-
riod. 
Staff Review of the Economic Situation 
The information reviewed for the December 15–16 
meeting suggested that real gross domestic product 
(GDP) was increasing at a moderate pace and that labor 
market conditions had improved further.  Consumer 
price inflation continued to run below the FOMC’s 
longer-run objective of 2 percent, restrained in part by 
declines in both energy prices and the prices of non-en-
ergy imported goods.  Some survey-based measures of 
longer-run inflation expectations edged down, while 
market-based measures of inflation compensation were 
still low. 
Total nonfarm payroll employment expanded at a faster 
monthly rate in October and November than in the third 
quarter.  The unemployment rate ticked down to 
5.0 percent in October and remained at that level in No-
vember; over the 12 months ending in November, the 
unemployment rate fell ¾ percentage point.  Both the 
labor force participation rate and the employment-to-
population ratio increased slightly, on net, over October 
and November.  The share of workers employed part 
time for economic reasons was flat, on balance, in recent 
months after declining considerably over the previous 
year.  The rates of private-sector job openings, hires, and 
quits were little changed in October from their average 
levels in the third quarter.  Recent measures of the gains 
in labor compensation were mixed:  Over the four quar-
ters ending in the third quarter, compensation per hour 
in the business sector advanced at a strong 3½ percent 
rate, while the employment cost index rose at a more 
moderate 2 percent pace.  Average hourly earnings for 
all employees increased 2¼ percent over the 12 months 
ending in November. 
Manufacturing production increased in October,          
although output in the mining sector continued to de-
crease.  Automakers’ assembly schedules and broader in-
dicators of manufacturing production, such as the read-
ings on new orders from national and regional manufac-
turing surveys, generally pointed to a slow pace of gains 
in factory output in the coming months.  Information 
on crude oil and natural gas extraction through early De-
cember indicated further declines in mining output. 
Real personal consumption expenditures (PCE) ap-
peared to be rising at a solid rate in the fourth quarter.  
The components of the nominal retail sales data used by 
the Bureau of Economic Analysis to construct its esti-
mate of PCE increased in October and moved up at a 
faster pace in November, while the rate of sales of light 
motor vehicles remained high.  Household spending was 
supported by strong growth in real disposable income in 
September and October, and households’ net worth was 
bolstered by recent gains in home values.  In addition, 
consumer sentiment in the University of Michigan Sur-
veys of Consumers improved a little in November and 
early December. 
Recent information on activity in the housing sector was 
mixed.  Starts of new single-family homes were some-
what lower in October than in the third quarter, alt-
hough building permits moved up.  Meanwhile, starts of 
multifamily units declined.  Sales of new homes rose in 
October, while existing home sales decreased. 
Real private expenditures for business equipment and in-
tellectual property products increased at a solid pace in 
the third quarter, but business spending growth looked 
to be slowing somewhat in the fourth quarter.  Nominal 
shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding air-
craft edged down in October, although new orders for 
these capital goods continued to move up.  Recent read-
ings from national and regional surveys of business con-
ditions were consistent with more modest increases in 
business equipment spending than in the third quarter.  
Firms’ nominal spending for nonresidential structures 
excluding drilling and mining rose in October, although 
available indicators of drilling activity, such as the num-
ber of oil and gas rigs in operation, continued to fall 
through early December. 
Total real government purchases appeared to be about 
flat in the fourth quarter.  Federal government spending 
for defense moved roughly sideways, on balance, over 
recent months.  State and local government payrolls 
were little changed, on net, in October and November, 
while the level of nominal construction spending of 
these governments in October was essentially the same 
as its average in the third quarter. 
The U.S. international trade deficit widened in October 
after narrowing in September.  Exports declined, on bal-
ance, to the lowest level in three years; lower prices for 
commodities, along with reduced shipments of capital 
and consumer goods, weighed on nominal exports.  Im-
ports decreased in September and October, partly re-
flecting further declines in the price of imported oil.  The 
available trade data suggested that declines in real net ex-
ports would likely continue to be a drag on real GDP 
growth in the fourth quarter. 
Total U.S. consumer prices, as measured by the PCE 
price index, rose only ¼ percent over the 12 months 
ending in October, held down by large declines in con-
sumer energy prices.  Core PCE inflation, which ex-
cludes changes in food and energy prices, was 1¼ per-
cent over the same 12-month period, partly restrained by 
declines in the prices of non-energy imported goods.  
Over the 12 months ending in November, total con-
sumer prices as measured by the consumer price index 
(CPI) rose ½ percent, while core CPI inflation was 2 per-
cent.  Survey measures of expected longer-run inflation 
were relatively stable, although they showed some hints 
of having edged slightly lower:  In November and early 
December, the Michigan survey measure continued to 
run somewhat below its typical range of the past 
15 years, though historical patterns suggest that these 
relatively low readings may have reflected softness in to-
tal inflation and energy prices.  The measures from both 
the Survey of Professional Forecasters for the fourth 
quarter and the Survey of Primary Dealers in December 
moved down slightly. 
Foreign real GDP growth improved in the third quarter 
after being weak in the first half, and recent indicators 
were consistent with a further moderate expansion in the 
fourth quarter.  Economic activity in Canada rebounded 
in the third quarter, boosted by rising exports and a 
smaller drag from declines in oil-sector investment.  The 
Japanese economy expanded in the third quarter follow-
ing a small contraction in the previous quarter.  In con-
trast, growth in the euro-area economy slowed in the 
third quarter.  Recent indicators for economic activity in 
China were relatively favorable, and several other emerg-
ing Asian economies strengthened in the third quarter.  
Mexican economic growth also picked up in the third 
quarter, but the Brazilian economy continued to con-
tract.  Falling energy prices kept headline inflation very 
low in many foreign economies. 
Staff Review of the Financial Situation 
Federal Reserve communications and economic data re-
leases over the intermeeting period appeared to have led 
investors to raise the odds they assigned to an increase 
in the target range for the federal funds rate at the De-
cember FOMC meeting.  The October FOMC state-
ment and the stronger-than-expected October employ-
ment report, in particular, boosted expectations of 
FOMC action at this meeting.  Subsequent data releases 
and FOMC communications firmed those views, and in 
the weeks before the meeting, market participants came 
to attach high odds to the possibility of a December in-
crease. 
The expected path of the federal funds rate implied by 
market quotes on interest rate derivatives rose moder-
ately over the intermeeting period.  Nominal yields on  
2- and 10-year Treasury securities rose about 40 basis 
points and 25 basis points, respectively.  Measures of in-
flation compensation based on Treasury Inflation-Pro-
tected Securities remained low. 
Over the first few weeks of the intermeeting period, the 
increase in the perceived likelihood of an increase in the 
target range for the federal funds rate at the December 
meeting was not accompanied by a rise in implied or re-
alized volatility in domestic equity and fixed-income 
markets.  However, later in the period, concerns among 
market participants about the implications of falling 
crude oil prices and the credit quality of high-yield bonds 
evidently increased.  In reaction, broad measures of U.S. 
equity prices declined, with a steep selloff in energy-sec-
tor stocks, and the one-month-ahead option-implied 
volatility on the S&P 500 index, the VIX, climbed.  In 
addition, strains in the high-yield bond market increased 
notably after a mutual fund that specialized in very low-
rated and unrated bonds suspended investor redemp-
tions and closed.  Over the intermeeting period, high-
yield bond spreads widened significantly, on net, partic-
ularly for bonds rated triple-C or below, with more pro-
nounced increases for firms in the energy sector.  In con-
trast, spreads on investment-grade corporate bonds were 
little changed on balance. 
Nonfinancial businesses continued to tap financial mar-
kets at a brisk pace in the intermeeting period.  Issuance 
of investment-grade corporate bonds and institutional 
leveraged loans remained solid, buoyed by demand to fi-
nance mergers and acquisitions.  Growth of commercial 
and industrial loans on banks’ books continued to be 
strong in October and November, driven mainly by the 
expansion of large loans at large banks.  However, high-
yield bond issuance slowed and refinancing-related lev-
eraged loan issuance stayed weak during the intermeet-
ing period. 
Corporate earnings and credit quality continued to show 
some signs of weakening.  Available reports and analysts’ 
estimates suggested that aggregate earnings per share in 
the third quarter declined slightly compared with year-
earlier levels, in line with expectations.  Earnings were 
particularly weak in the energy and materials sectors be-
cause of declines in prices of crude oil and metals.  The 
stronger dollar appeared to weigh on earnings growth 
across many sectors. 
Conditions in the municipal bond market were generally 
stable.  Gross issuance of municipal bonds was solid in 
recent months.  Yields on municipal bonds declined a 
little, leaving their ratios to long-term Treasury yields 
somewhat lower but still near the high end of their his-
torical range. 
Financing conditions for commercial real estate tight-
ened somewhat.  Spreads on commercial mortgage-
backed securities (CMBS) widened further, suggesting 
that investors in CMBS continued to reassess the risks 
in this sector following several years of robust demand 
for these securities.  Nonetheless, underwriting stand-
ards continued to be relatively loose, and financing con-
ditions appeared to remain quite accommodative overall.  
CMBS issuance stayed strong. 
Residential mortgage market conditions were little 
changed, on net, over the intermeeting period.  Credit 
remained tight for borrowers with low credit scores, 
hard-to-document income, or higher debt-to-income ra-
tios.  Interest rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages in-
creased 30 basis points, in line with increases in yields on 
mortgage-backed securities and comparable-maturity 
Treasury securities.  Nevertheless, mortgage rates con-
tinued to be quite low by historical standards. 
Consumer credit markets remained accommodative for 
most borrowers.  Consumer loan balances continued to 
rise at a robust pace through October because of sus-
tained expansion in credit card balances and sizable in-
creases in auto and student loans; growth of student 
loans continued to slow gradually.  Student and auto 
loans remained broadly available, even to borrowers 
with subprime credit histories, but the availability of 
credit card loans for subprime borrowers was still tight. 
Movements in foreign financial markets over the period 
reflected increased expectations that the FOMC would 
begin raising the target range for the federal funds rate 
in December, investors’ views about monetary policies 
abroad, and substantial declines in commodity prices.  
The broad nominal index of the dollar rose appreciably.  
Equity indexes declined in many advanced and emerging 
market economies amid concerns about corporate earn-
ings and falling oil and metals prices.  Short-term sover-
eign yields changed little in the euro area and Japan but 
rose moderately in the United Kingdom.  Longer-term 
sovereign yields moved higher in Europe along with U.S. 
Treasury yields. 
Staff Economic Outlook 
In the economic forecast prepared by the staff for the 
December FOMC meeting, real GDP growth in the sec-
ond half of this year was little changed, on net, relative 
to the projection for the October meeting.  The staff’s 
medium-term projection for real GDP growth was re-
vised up slightly, on balance, from the previous forecast, 
primarily because the recently passed Bipartisan Budget 
Act of 2015 was anticipated to lead to somewhat higher 
federal government purchases.  The staff continued to 
project that real GDP would expand at a somewhat 
faster pace than potential output in 2016 through 2018, 
supported primarily by increases in consumer spending.  
The unemployment rate was expected to decline gradu-
ally and to run somewhat below the staff’s estimate of 
its longer-run natural rate over this period. 
The staff’s forecast for inflation was revised down 
slightly in the near term in response to recent data for 
consumer prices and the further decline in the price of 
crude oil; over the medium term, the projection was little 
revised.  Energy prices and prices of non-energy im-
ported goods were expected to begin steadily rising next 
year.  The staff projected that inflation would increase 
gradually over the next several years and reach the Com-
mittee’s longer-run objective of 2 percent by the end of 
2018. 
The staff viewed the uncertainty around its December 
projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment 
rate, and inflation as similar to the average of the past

president is scheduled to assume office on January 1, 2016.  
20 years.  The risks to the forecast for real GDP were 
seen as tilted somewhat to the downside, reflecting the 
staff’s assessment that neither monetary nor fiscal policy 
was currently well positioned to help the economy with-
stand substantial adverse shocks.  Consistent with this 
downside risk to aggregate demand, the staff viewed the 
risks to its outlook for the unemployment rate as skewed 
somewhat to the upside.  The risks to the projection for 
inflation were seen as weighted to the downside, reflect-
ing the possibility that longer-term inflation expectations 
may have edged down and that the foreign exchange 
value of the dollar could rise substantially further, which 
would put downward pressure on inflation. 
Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the 
Economic Outlook 
In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, members of 
the Board of Governors and Federal Reserve Bank pres-
idents submitted their projections of the most likely out-
comes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, in-
flation, and the federal funds rate for each year from 
2015 through 2018 and over the longer run.3  Each par-
ticipant’s projections were conditioned on his or her 
judgment of appropriate monetary policy.  The longer-
run projections represent each participant’s assessment 
of the rate to which each variable would be expected to 
converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy 
and in the absence of further shocks to the economy.  
These projections and policy assessments are described 
in the Summary of Economic Projections, which is an 
addendum to these minutes. 
In their discussion of the economic situation and the 
outlook, meeting participants viewed the information re-
ceived over the intermeeting period as indicating that 
economic activity was expanding moderately and con-
firming that underutilization of labor resources had di-
minished appreciably since early in the year.  Partici-
pants’ outlook indicated that, with gradual adjustments 
in the stance of monetary policy, real GDP would con-
tinue to increase at a moderate rate over the medium 
term and that labor market indicators would continue to 
strengthen.  They anticipated that the relative strength in 
domestic demand would be only partially offset by some 
further weakness in net exports.  Participants generally 
saw the downside risks to U.S. economic activity from 
global economic and financial developments, although 
still material, as having diminished since late summer.  In 
addition, new and revised information on employment 
James M. Lyon, First Vice President of the Federal Reserve 
Bank of Minneapolis, submitted economic projections. 
in recent months had reduced earlier concerns about a 
possible slowing of progress in the labor market.  Ac-
cordingly, taking into account domestic and interna-
tional developments, most participants judged the risks 
to the outlook for both economic activity and the labor 
market to be balanced. 
Incoming data indicated that inflation continued to run 
below the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run objective, 
partly reflecting declines in energy prices and prices of 
non-energy imports.  The price of crude oil fell further 
over the intermeeting period, and many participants low-
ered their near-term forecasts for inflation somewhat 
while leaving their medium-term forecasts little changed.  
Nearly all continued to anticipate that inflation would 
rise to or very close to 2 percent over the medium term 
as the transitory effects of declines in energy and import 
prices dissipated and the labor market strengthened fur-
ther.  Over the intermeeting period, market-based 
measures of inflation compensation stayed low; some 
survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expecta-
tions edged down.  Although many participants re-
mained concerned about downside risks attending the 
outlook for inflation, a majority of participants saw the 
risks to the outlook for inflation as balanced. 
Consumer spending continued to rise at a solid rate in 
recent months; retail sales picked up over the October–
November period, and motor vehicle sales remained 
strong.  The available information from District business 
contacts was generally consistent with the recent trend 
in data on spending, although a couple of reports noted 
that households were spending cautiously and that some 
price discounting was likely.  Over the coming year, par-
ticipants expected consumer outlays to be supported im-
portantly by ongoing gains in jobs, rising income, and 
improved household balance sheets.  In addition, several 
participants pointed out that low energy costs should 
help support consumer expenditures. 
The housing market was recovering gradually, with     
single-family homebuilding continuing to trend up and 
multifamily construction remaining at a high level.  The 
reports on the pace of construction and real estate activ-
ity across Districts varied.  Nonetheless, several partici-
pants noted factors pointing to continued improvement 
in the housing sector, including ongoing house price ap-
preciation, low levels of home inventories, the substan-
tial gap between the rate of household formation and the 
relatively slow pace of construction, and the possibility 
that homebuyers may be entering the market in anticipa-
tion of higher mortgage rates.  Outside of the residential 
sector, commercial building was highlighted as an area 
of relative strength in a few Districts. 
As a result of the recently passed Bipartisan Budget Act, 
federal spending was expected to provide a modest 
boost to economic activity over the next few years.  Con-
tacts in one District with a relatively large amount of fed-
eral government activity reported that their businesses 
would also benefit from the reduced uncertainty about 
the federal fiscal outlook. 
Business activity was solid outside of sectors adversely 
affected by low energy prices and weak exports.  A num-
ber of participants commented on the strength in the 
services sector in their Districts, citing, in particular, ac-
tivity in high-tech, transportation, leisure and hospitality, 
and health-related businesses.  Some reported that the 
stronger manufacturing industries in their Districts in-
cluded aerospace, power generation equipment, and 
medical equipment, and that the domestic auto industry 
was still a bright spot.  However, manufacturing activity 
overall continued to be restrained by weakness in indus-
tries with significant international exposures, such as 
steel, agricultural and drilling equipment, and chemicals.  
In addition, domestic energy producers and their service 
suppliers remained under significant pressure from the 
excess supply of crude oil and declining prices.  The cut-
backs in drilling led to further reductions in capital 
spending and to layoffs; credit conditions for some firms 
continued to deteriorate.  In the agricultural sector, high 
levels of domestic crop production and weak global de-
mand had depressed commodity prices, and farm in-
come was expected to decline. 
Participants generally agreed that the drag on U.S. eco-
nomic activity from the appreciation of the dollar since 
the summer of 2014 and the slowdown in foreign eco-
nomic growth, particularly in emerging market econo-
mies, was likely to continue to depress U.S. net exports 
for some time.  Many expressed the view that the risks 
to the global economy that emerged late this summer 
had receded and anticipated moderate improvement in 
economic growth abroad in the coming year as currency 
and commodity markets stabilized.  However, partici-
pants cited a number of lingering concerns, including the 
possibility that further dollar appreciation and persistent 
weakness in commodity prices could increase the stress 
on emerging market economies and that China could 
find it difficult to navigate the cyclical and structural 
changes under way in its economy.  Several upside risks 
to the U.S. outlook also were noted, including the possi-
bility that declining energy prices could spur consumer 
spending more than currently anticipated. 
Consumer prices, as measured by the PCE index, were 
little changed, on net, in September and October, held 
down importantly by declines in energy prices; core PCE 
prices posted only small increases.  Over the intermeet-
ing period, crude oil prices dropped notably, other com-
modity prices declined, and the dollar appreciated fur-
ther.  The 12-month change in the core PCE price index 
was 1.3 percent in October and had been running at 
about that rate since the beginning of the year, despite 
the declines in prices of non-energy imported goods 
over the period.  Several participants noted that alterna-
tive indicators of underlying inflation, such as the core 
CPI, the trimmed mean PCE, and the sticky price CPI, 
showed somewhat higher year-over-year increases, close 
to or above 2 percent.  Inflation by these measures, how-
ever, had typically run higher than PCE price inflation, 
and a range of views was expressed about their implica-
tions for the outlook for PCE inflation. 
Almost all participants continued to expect that once en-
ergy prices and prices of non-energy commodities stabi-
lized, the effects of the declines in those prices on head-
line and core PCE inflation would fade.  Moreover, with 
margins of resource underutilization having already di-
minished appreciably and longer-run inflation expecta-
tions reasonably stable, most anticipated that tightening 
resource utilization over the next year would contribute 
to higher inflation.  Nearly all participants were now rea-
sonably confident that inflation would move back to 
2 percent over the medium term.  However, because of 
the recent further decline in crude oil prices, many par-
ticipants judged that falling energy prices would depress 
headline inflation somewhat longer than previously an-
ticipated.  Also, several observed that the additional ap-
preciation of the dollar would continue to hold down the 
prices of imported goods.  Although almost all still ex-
pected that the downward pressure on inflation from en-
ergy and commodity prices would be transitory, many 
viewed the persistent weakness in those prices as adding 
uncertainty or posing important downside risks to the 
inflation outlook. 
Participants also discussed readings from various mar-
ket- and survey-based measures of longer-run inflation 
expectations.  Recently, some of the available surveys 
had reported softer longer-run inflation expectations, 
while others suggested still-stable expectations.  In addi-
tion, the market-based measures of inflation compensa-
tion that had declined earlier were still at low levels.  A 
number of participants noted, based on historical pat-
terns, that some of the survey-based measures could be 
overly sensitive to energy price fluctuations rather than 
indicating shifts in perceptions of underlying inflation 
trends and that the declines in the market-based 
measures could reflect changes in risk and liquidity pre-
miums.  Many concluded that longer-run inflation ex-
pectations remained reasonably stable.  However, some 
expressed concerns that inflation expectations may have 
already moved lower, or that they might do so if inflation 
persisted for much longer at a rate below the Commit-
tee’s objective. 
Labor market conditions improved further in recent 
months:  Monthly gains in nonfarm payroll employment 
averaged more than 200,000 over the period from Sep-
tember to November, and the unemployment rate edged 
lower.  The cumulative reduction in the underutilization 
of labor resources since early in the year was appreciable.  
The unemployment rate, at 5.0 percent in November, 
was 0.7 percentage point lower than in January and close 
to most participants’ estimates of its longer-run normal 
level.  Broader measures of underemployment that in-
clude marginally attached workers and those employed 
part time for economic reasons also fell substantially 
since January.  However, the labor force participation 
rate moved down since January as well, with some 
FOMC participants attributing part of the decline to de-
mographic trends or a structural rise in detachment 
among prime-age men.  A number of participants ob-
served that wage increases had begun to pick up, or that 
they appeared likely to do so over the coming year.      
Although many participants judged that the improve-
ment in labor market conditions had been substantial, 
some others indicated that further progress in reducing 
labor market slack would be required before conditions 
would be consistent with the Committee’s objective of 
maximum employment.  In particular, some participants 
stressed the importance of the pace of economic growth 
staying above that of potential output in order to reduce 
remaining labor underutilization across broader dimen-
sions—for example, by lowering the still-elevated num-
bers of workers employed part time for economic rea-
sons and by encouraging additional workers who are 
currently outside the labor force but want a job to 
reenter the labor force. 
Most participants expected that the unemployment rate 
would edge below their estimates of its longer-run level 
in the coming year and then stabilize for a time, with the 
further strengthening of the labor market helping move 
inflation higher.  Because labor compensation was still 
increasing at a subdued rate and inflation remained well 
below 2 percent, some participants judged that a moder-
ate further decline in unemployment would be unlikely 
to lead to a buildup of unduly strong inflation pressures.  
A few commented that a sustained period of labor mar-
ket activity above levels consistent with maximum em-
ployment should speed the rise in inflation to the Com-
mittee’s objective. 
Financial conditions tightened modestly over the inter-
meeting period.  Quotes in financial markets and survey 
results suggested that investors were quite confident that 
the Committee would raise the federal funds target range 
25 basis points at the current meeting.  Concerns among 
investors about the high-yield bond market increased 
notably in the days before the meeting after an open-
ended mutual fund specializing in junk bonds suspended 
redemptions and closed.  In their discussion, several par-
ticipants commented that markets for leveraged finance 
had been correcting since midyear—particularly for the 
most risky assets, including those associated with energy 
firms—and noted that the widening of credit spreads in 
corporate bond markets appeared to be largely due to 
the repricing of riskier assets. 
During their consideration of economic conditions and 
monetary policy, almost all participants agreed that the 
improvements that had occurred in the labor market and 
their confidence in a return of inflation to 2 percent over 
the medium term now satisfied the Committee’s criteria 
for beginning the policy normalization process.  Partici-
pants also discussed the implications of economic con-
ditions going forward for the likely future path of the 
target range for the federal funds rate.  Even after the 
initial increase in the target range, the stance of policy 
would remain accommodative.  Participants saw several 
reasons why a gradual removal of policy accommodation 
would likely be appropriate.  Normalizing policy gradu-
ally would keep the stance of monetary policy suffi-
ciently accommodative to support further improvement 
in labor market conditions and to exert upward pressure 
on inflation.  Also, a number of participants pointed out 
that because inflation was still running well below the 
Committee’s objective and the outlook for inflation was 
subject to considerable uncertainty, it would probably 
take some time for the data to confirm that inflation was 
on a trajectory to return to 2 percent over the medium 
term.  Gradual adjustments in the federal funds rate 
would also allow policymakers to assess how the econ-
omy was responding to increases in interest rates.  In ad-
dition, by several estimates, the neutral short-term real 
interest rate was currently close to zero and was expected 
to rise only slowly as headwinds restraining the expan-
sion receded.  Moreover, the ability of monetary policy 
to offset the economic effects of an unanticipated eco-
nomic shock  remained  asymmetric,  and  a cautious ap-
proach to normalizing policy could help minimize the 
risk of having to respond to a negative economic shock 
while the policy rate remained near its effective lower 
bound. 
While viewing a gradual approach to policy normaliza-
tion as likely to be appropriate given their economic out-
look, participants emphasized the need to adjust the pol-
icy path as economic conditions evolved and to avoid 
appearing to commit to any specific pace of adjustments.  
They stressed the importance of communicating clearly 
that the future policy path could become shallower if the 
economic expansion weakened and inflation rose more 
slowly than currently anticipated, and that it could be-
come steeper if real activity and inflation surprised to the 
upside.  A few participants also indicated that significant 
risks to financial stability, should they emerge, could al-
ter their view of the appropriate policy path. 
Committee Policy Action 
In their discussion of monetary policy for the period 
ahead, members judged that information received since 
the FOMC met in October indicated that economic ac-
tivity had been expanding at a moderate pace.  Although 
net exports remained soft, consumer and business 
spending remained solid, and the housing sector im-
proved further.  Overall, taking into account domestic 
and foreign developments, members saw the risks to the 
outlook for both economic activity and the labor market 
as balanced, and they expected that, with gradual adjust-
ments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activ-
ity would most likely continue to expand at a moderate 
pace. 
Members agreed that a range of recent labor market in-
dicators, including ongoing job gains and declining un-
employment, showed further improvement and con-
firmed that underutilization of labor resources had di-
minished appreciably since early this year.  Members an-
ticipated that economic activity was likely to continue to 
expand at a pace sufficient to lead to a further increase 
in the utilization of labor resources, and many members 
judged that additional progress would be required to 
reach the Committee’s maximum-employment objec-
tive. 
Inflation continued to run below the Committee’s 
longer-run objective, held down in part by the effects of 
declines in energy and non-energy import prices.       
Market-based measures of inflation compensation re-
mained low; some survey-based measures of longer-
term inflation expectations had edged down.  Members 
anticipated that the further decline in crude oil prices 
over the intermeeting period was likely to exert some ad-
ditional transitory downward pressure on inflation in the 
near term. 
Regarding the medium-term outlook, inflation was pro-
jected to increase gradually as energy prices and prices of 
non-energy imports stabilized and the labor market 
strengthened.  Overall, taking into account economic de-
velopments and the outlook for economic activity and 
the labor market, the Committee was now reasonably 
confident in its expectation that inflation would rise, 
over the medium term, to its 2 percent objective.  How-
ever, for some members, the risks attending their infla-
tion forecasts remained considerable.  Among those 
risks was the possibility that additional downward 
shocks to prices of oil and other commodities or a sus-
tained rise in the exchange value of the dollar could delay 
or diminish the expected upturn in inflation.  A couple 
also worried that a further strengthening of the labor 
market might not prove sufficient to offset the down-
ward pressures from global disinflationary forces.  And 
several expressed unease with indications that inflation 
expectations may have moved down slightly.  In view of 
these risks and the shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, 
members expressed their intention to carefully monitor 
actual and expected progress toward the Committee’s in-
flation goal. 
After assessing the outlook for economic activity, the la-
bor market, and inflation and weighing the uncertainties 
associated with the outlook, members agreed to raise the 
target range for the federal funds rate to ¼ to ½ percent 
at this meeting.  A number of members commented that 
it was appropriate to begin policy normalization in re-
sponse to the substantial progress in the labor market 
toward achieving the Committee’s objective of maxi-
mum employment and their reasonable confidence that 
inflation would move to 2 percent over the medium 
term.  Members agreed that the postmeeting statement 
should report that the Committee’s decision reflected 
both the economic outlook and the time it takes for pol-
icy actions to affect future economic outcomes.  If the 
Committee waited to begin removing accommodation 
until it was closer to achieving its dual-mandate objec-
tives, it might need to tighten policy abruptly, which 
could risk disrupting economic activity.  Members ob-
served that after this initial increase in the federal funds 
rate, the stance of monetary policy would remain accom-
modative.  However, some members said that their de-
cision to raise the target range was a close call, particu-
larly given the uncertainty about inflation dynamics, and 
emphasized the need to monitor the progress of infla-
tion closely. 
Members also discussed their expectations for the size 
and timing of adjustments in the target range for the fed-
eral funds rate going forward.  Based on their current 
forecasts for economic activity, the labor market, and in-
flation, as well as their expectation that the neutral short-
term real interest rate will rise slowly over the next few 
years, members expected economic conditions would 
evolve in a manner that would warrant only gradual in-
creases in the federal funds rate.  However, they also rec-
ognized that the appropriate path for the federal funds 
rate would depend on the economic outlook as informed 
by incoming data.  Members stressed the potential need 
to accelerate or slow the pace of normalization as the 
economic outlook evolved.  In the current situation, be-
cause of their significant concern about still-low readings 
on actual inflation and the uncertainty and risks present 
in the inflation outlook, they agreed to indicate that the 
Committee would carefully monitor actual and expected 
progress toward its inflation goal.  In determining the 
size and timing of further adjustments to monetary pol-
icy, some members emphasized the importance of con-
firming that inflation would rise as projected and of 
maintaining the credibility of the Committee’s inflation 
objective.  Based on their current economic outlook, 
they continued to anticipate that the federal funds rate 
was likely to remain, for some time, below levels that the 
Committee expected to prevail in the longer run. 
The Committee also maintained its policy of reinvesting 
principal payments from agency debt and agency     
mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed 
securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securi-
ties at auction.  In view of members’ outlook for mod-
erate growth in economic activity, inflation moving to-
ward its target only gradually, and the asymmetric risks 
posed by the continued proximity of short-term interest 
rates to their effective lower bound, the Committee an-
ticipated retaining this policy until normalization of the 
level of the federal funds rate was well under way.  This 
policy, by keeping the Committee’s holdings of longer-
term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain ac-
commodative financial conditions. 
At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee 
voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank 
of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to 
execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with 
the following domestic policy directive, to be released at 
2:00 p.m.: 
“Effective December 17, 2015, the Federal Open 
Market Committee directs the Desk to undertake 
open market operations as necessary to maintain 
the federal funds rate in a target range of ¼ to 
½ percent, including:  (1) overnight reverse re-
purchase operations (and reverse repurchase op-
erations with maturities of more than one day 
when necessary to accommodate weekend, holi-
day, or similar trading conventions) at an offer-
ing rate of 0.25 percent, in amounts limited only 
by the value of Treasury securities held outright 
in the System Open Market Account that are 
available for such operations and by a per-coun-
terparty limit of $30 billion per day; and (2) term 
reverse repurchase operations to the extent ap-
proved in the resolution on term RRP operations 
approved by the Committee at its March 17–18, 
2015, meeting. 
The Committee directs the Desk to continue 
rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auc-
tion and to continue reinvesting principal pay-
ments on all agency debt and agency mortgage-
backed securities in agency mortgage-backed se-
curities.  The Committee also directs the Desk to 
engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transac-
tions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the 
Federal Reserve’s agency mortgage-backed secu-
rities transactions.” 
The vote also encompassed approval of the statement 
below to be released at 2:00 p.m.: 
“Information received since the Federal Open 
Market Committee met in October suggests that 
economic activity has been expanding at a mod-
erate pace.  Household spending and business 
fixed investment have been increasing at solid 
rates in recent months, and the housing sector 
has improved further; however, net exports have 
been soft.  A range of recent labor market indi-
cators, including ongoing job gains and declining 
unemployment, shows further improvement and 
confirms that underutilization of labor resources 
has diminished appreciably since early this year.  
Inflation has continued to run below the Com-
mittee’s 2 percent longer-run objective, partly re-
flecting declines in energy prices and in prices of 
non-energy imports.  Market-based measures of 
inflation compensation remain low; some sur-
vey-based measures of longer-term inflation ex-
pectations have edged down. 
Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Com-
mittee seeks to foster maximum employment 
and price stability.  The Committee currently ex-
pects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance 
of monetary policy, economic activity will con-
tinue to expand at a moderate pace and labor 
market indicators will continue to strengthen.  
Overall, taking into account domestic and inter-
national developments, the Committee sees the 
risks to the outlook for both economic activity 
and the labor market as balanced.  Inflation is ex-
pected to rise to 2 percent over the medium term 
as the transitory effects of declines in energy and 
import prices dissipate and the labor market 
strengthens further.  The Committee continues 
to monitor inflation developments closely. 
The Committee judges that there has been con-
siderable improvement in labor market condi-
tions this year, and it is reasonably confident that 
inflation will rise, over the medium term, to its 
2 percent objective.  Given the economic out-
look, and recognizing the time it takes for policy 
actions to affect future economic outcomes, the 
Committee decided to raise the target range for 
the federal funds rate to ¼ to ½ percent.  The 
stance of monetary policy remains accommoda-
tive after this increase, thereby supporting fur-
ther improvement in labor market conditions 
and a return to 2 percent inflation. 
In determining the timing and size of future ad-
justments to the target range for the federal 
funds rate, the Committee will assess realized 
and expected economic conditions relative to its 
objectives of maximum employment and 2 per-
cent inflation.  This assessment will take into ac-
count a wide range of information, including 
measures of labor market conditions, indicators 
of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, 
and readings on financial and international devel-
opments.  In light of the current shortfall of in-
flation from 2 percent, the Committee will care-
fully monitor actual and expected progress to-
ward its inflation goal.  The Committee expects 
that economic conditions will evolve in a manner 
that will warrant only gradual increases in the 
federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely 
to remain, for some time, below levels that are 
expected to prevail in the longer run.  However, 
the actual path of the federal funds rate will de-
pend on the economic outlook as informed by 
incoming data. 
The Committee is maintaining its existing policy 
of reinvesting principal payments from its hold-
ings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed 
securities in agency mortgage-backed securities 
and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities 
at auction, and it anticipates doing so until nor-
malization of the level of the federal funds rate is 
well under way.  This policy, by keeping the 
Committee’s holdings of longer-term securities 
at sizable levels, should help maintain accommo-
dative financial conditions.” 
Voting for this action:  Janet L. Yellen, William C. 
Dudley, Lael Brainard, Charles L. Evans, Stanley 
Fischer, Jeffrey M. Lacker, Dennis P. Lockhart, Jerome 
H. Powell, Daniel K. Tarullo, and John C. Williams. 
Voting against this action:  None. 
To support the Committee’s decision to raise the target 
range for the federal funds rate, the Board of Governors 
voted unanimously to raise the interest rates on required 
and excess reserve balances by ¼ percentage point, to 
½ percent, effective December 17, 2015.  The Board of 
Governors also voted unanimously to approve a ¼ per-
centage point increase in the primary credit rate (dis-
count rate) to 1 percent, effective December 17, 2015.4 
4 In taking this action, the Board approved requests submitted 
by the boards of directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of 
Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, 
St. Louis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco.  This vote 
also encompassed approval by the Board of Governors of the 
establishment of a 1 percent primary credit rate by the remain-
ing Federal Reserve Banks, effective on the later of Decem-
ber 17, 2015, and the date such Reserve Banks informed the 
Secretary of the Board of such a request.  (Secretary’s note:  
After these policy decisions, the deputy manager of the 
System Open Market Account briefed the Committee 
on plans for term RRPs over year-end. 
It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee 
would be held on Tuesday–Wednesday, January 26–27, 
2016.  The meeting adjourned at 10:30 a.m. on Decem-
ber 16, 2015. 
Notation Vote 
By notation vote completed on November 17, 2015, the 
Committee unanimously approved the minutes of the 
Committee meeting held on October 27–28, 2015. 
Brian F. Madigan 
Secretary 
Subsequently, the Federal Reserve Banks of New York and 
Minneapolis were informed by the Secretary of the Board of 
the Board’s approval of their establishment of a primary credit 
rate of 1 percent, effective December 17, 2015.)  This vote of 
the Board of Governors also encompassed approval of the re-
newal by all 12 Federal Reserve Banks of the existing formulas 
for calculating the rates applicable to discounts and advances 
under the secondary and seasonal credit programs. 
Summary of Economic Projections 
In conjunction with the Federal Open Market Commit-
tee (FOMC) meeting held on December 15–16, 2015, 
meeting participants submitted their projections of the 
most likely outcomes for real output growth, the unem-
ployment rate, inflation, and the federal funds rate for 
each year from 2015 to 2018 and over the longer run.1  
Each participant’s projection was based on information 
available at the time of the meeting, together with his or 
her assessment of appropriate monetary policy and as-
sumptions about the factors likely to affect economic 
outcomes.  The longer-run projections represent each 
participant’s assessment of the value to which each var-
iable would be expected to converge, over time, under 
appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of fur-
ther shocks to the economy.  “Appropriate monetary 
policy” is defined as the future path of policy that each 
participant deems most likely to foster outcomes for 
economic activity and inflation that best satisfy his or her 
individual interpretation of the Federal Reserve’s objec-
tives of maximum employment and stable prices. 
FOMC participants generally expected that, under ap-
propriate monetary policy, real gross domestic product 
(GDP) growth in 2016 and 2017 would be at or some-
what above their individual estimates of the longer-run 
growth rate and would converge toward its longer-run 
rate in 2018 (table 1 and figure 1).  All participants pro-
jected that the unemployment rate would decline further 
in 2016.  Most participants expected that in 2018 the un-
employment rate would remain somewhat below their 
individual judgments of its longer-run normal rate.  Par-
ticipants projected that inflation, as measured by the 
four-quarter change in the price index for personal con-
sumption expenditures (PCE), would pick up in 2016 
and 2017 from the very low rate seen in 2015.  Almost 
all participants projected inflation in 2018 to be at or 
very near the Committee’s 2 percent objective. 
As shown in figure 2, all but two participants thought 
that it would be appropriate to raise the target range for 
the federal funds rate before the end of 2015.  Most par-
ticipants expected that it would be appropriate to raise 
the target range for the federal funds rate gradually over 
the projection period as headwinds to economic growth 
dissipate slowly over time and as inflation rises toward

president is scheduled to assume office on January 1, 2016. 
the Committee’s goal of 2 percent.  Consistent with this 
outlook, most participants projected that the appropriate 
level of the federal funds rate would be below its longer-
run level through 2018. 
Almost all participants viewed the levels of uncertainty 
associated with their outlooks for economic growth and 
the unemployment rate as broadly similar to the norms 
of the previous 20 years.  Nearly all also viewed the levels 
of uncertainty associated with their inflation forecasts as 
broadly similar to historical norms.  Most participants 
saw the risks to their outlooks for real GDP growth and 
the unemployment rate as broadly balanced.  A majority 
viewed the risks attending their projections for both 
PCE and core PCE inflation as broadly balanced, but 
many saw these risks as weighted to the downside.  
Among those who saw the risks to their inflation out-
look as tilted to the downside, several highlighted the 
continued strength of the dollar and some recent indica-
tions that inflation expectations had declined as contrib-
uting to those risks. 
The Outlook for Economic Activity 
Participants generally projected that, conditional on their 
individual assumptions about appropriate monetary pol-
icy, real GDP would increase in 2016 and 2017 at a pace 
somewhat above their estimates of its longer-run rate.  
Real GDP growth would then slow in 2018 to a rate at 
or near their individual estimates of the longer-run nor-
mal rate.  Participants pointed to a number of factors 
that they expect will contribute to moderate output 
growth over the next few years, including labor market 
conditions that are supportive of economic expansion, 
household and business balance sheets that had im-
proved significantly since the financial crisis, and a 
stance of monetary policy that was expected to remain 
accommodative. 
Compared with their contributions to the Summary of 
Economic Projections (SEP) in September, participants’ 
projections of real GDP growth from 2016 to 2018 were 
generally little changed.  The median value of partici-
pants’ projections for real GDP growth in 2016 was re-
vised up slightly to 2.4 percent; some participants cited 
the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, which was passed in 
James M. Lyon, First Vice President of the Federal Reserve 
Bank of Minneapolis, submitted economic projections.

late October, as adding support to economic growth in 
the near term.  Very few participants changed their fore-
casts for real GDP growth in the longer run, resulting in 
an unchanged median. 
All participants projected that the unemployment rate 
would be at or below their individual judgments of its 
longer-run normal level from 2016 through 2018.  Com-
pared with the September SEP, most participants’ pro-
jected paths for the unemployment rate were revised 
down a little over those three years, with the median of 
the projections in the fourth quarter of each year at 
4.7 percent.  Many also revised down slightly their esti-
mates of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment, 
although the median forecast of 4.9 percent was un-
changed since September.  Participants generally cited 
stronger-than-expected labor market data in recent 
months as a factor explaining the downward revisions to 
their unemployment rate forecasts. 
Figures 3.A and 3.B show the distribution of partici-
pants’ views regarding the likely outcomes for real GDP 
growth and the unemployment rate through 2018 and in 
the longer run.  The distributions of the projections for 
real GDP growth over the next several years and in the 
longer run narrowed some since the September SEP.  
The diversity of views across participants on the outlook 
for GDP growth reflected, in part, differences in their 
individual assessments of the size and persistence of the 
effects of lower energy prices and a stronger dollar on 
real activity; the time it would take for the headwinds 
that have been restraining the pace of the economic ex-
pansion, such as financial and economic conditions 
abroad, to dissipate; and the appropriate path of mone-
tary policy.  With regard to the unemployment rate, the 
distributions of projections over the next three years 
shifted modestly to lower values since September.  
The Outlook for Inflation 
Nearly all participants saw PCE price inflation picking 
up in 2016, rising further in 2017, and then reaching a 
rate in 2018 at or very close to the Committee’s 2 percent 
longer-run objective.  However, relative to the Septem-
ber SEP, almost all participants marked down their pro-
jections for PCE price inflation in 2016, observing that 
recent declines in energy prices and the continued 
strength in the dollar could exert additional downward 
pressure on inflation in the near term.  Revisions to par-
ticipants’ inflation forecasts in 2017 were more mixed, 
while the projections for inflation in 2018 were little 
changed.  Most participants also marked down their pro-
jections for core PCE price inflation in 2016, although 
almost all still expected core inflation to rise gradually 
over the projection period and to be at or very close to 
2 percent by 2018.  Factors cited by participants as con-
tributing to their outlook that inflation will rise over the 
medium term included recent signs of a pickup in wage 
growth, their expectation of tighter resource utilization, 
their expectation that the effects of recent appreciation 
in the dollar and declines in oil prices on inflation will 
fade, their anticipation that inflation expectations will re-
main at levels consistent with the FOMC’s longer-run 
objective, and still-accommodative monetary policy. 
Figures 3.C and 3.D provide information on the distri-
bution of participants’ views about the outlook for infla-
tion.  The distribution of participants’ projections for 
PCE price inflation in 2016 and 2017 shifted to the left 
compared with the September SEP, while the distribu-
tions of projections for 2018 and in the longer run were 
little changed.  The distributions of projections for core 
PCE price inflation moved lower for 2016 and 2017 
compared with September but did not change for 2018. 
Appropriate Monetary Policy 
Figure 3.E provides the distribution of participants’ 
judgments regarding the appropriate level of the target 
federal funds rate at the end of each calendar year from 
2015 to 2018 and over the longer run.  Relative to Sep-
tember, the projections of the appropriate levels of the 
federal funds rate over the next three years generally 
shifted to lower values.  The median projection for next 
year was unchanged, but the medians for 2017 and 2018 
declined slightly.  The median projection now stands at 
1.4 percent at the end of 2016, 2.4 percent at the end of 
2017, and 3.3 percent at the end of 2018.  Given their 
expectations that economic headwinds will persist and 
that inflation will rise gradually to 2 percent over the next 
three years, most participants judged that it would be ap-
propriate for the federal funds rate to remain below its 
longer-run normal level from 2016 to 2018.  Participants 
projected that a gradual rise in the federal funds rate over 
that period would be appropriate as some of those head-
winds, such as sluggish foreign economic growth, dimin-
ish and the temporary factors holding down inflation 
dissipate.  Some participants noted that a gradual in-
crease in the federal funds rate would be consistent with 
their expectation that the neutral short-term real interest 
rate will rise slowly over the next few years. 
Both the median and the range of participants’ projec-
tions of the federal funds rate in the longer run, at 
3.5 percent and 3 to 4 percent, respectively, were un-
changed since September.  However, several participants 
revised their projections for the longer-run federal funds 
rate slightly lower.  All participants judged that inflation

in the longer run would be equal to the Committee’s ob-
jective of 2 percent, implying that their individual judg-
ments regarding the appropriate longer-run level of the 
real federal funds rate, in the absence of further shocks 
to the economy, ranged from 1 to 2 percent, the same as 
in September. 
Participants’ views of the appropriate path for monetary 
policy were informed by their judgments about the state 
of the economy and the outlook for labor markets and 
inflation.  One important consideration for many partic-
ipants was their estimate of the extent of slack remaining 
in the labor market, as informed by the incoming data 
on various labor market indicators.  Another was pro-
spects for inflation to return to the Committee’s objec-
tive of 2  percent; in making such assessments, partici-
pants considered a range of factors, including measures 
of inflation compensation and longer-run inflation ex-
pectations as well as the likely persistence and size of the 
effects from low energy prices and the strong dollar. 
Participants also emphasized the potential for interna-
tional developments to continue to have important im-
plications for domestic economic activity and inflation 
and thus for appropriate monetary policy.  Several par-
ticipants discussed potential interactions between policy 
normalization and risks to financial stability.  In addition, 
given the continued proximity of short-term interest 
rates to their effective lower bound, asymmetric risks 
around the outlook for employment and inflation were 
noted as one reason why a gradual approach to raising 
the federal funds rate may be appropriate. 
Uncertainty and Risks 
As in the September SEP, nearly all participants contin-
ued to judge the levels of uncertainty around their pro-
jections for real GDP growth and the unemployment 
rate as broadly similar to the average level of the past 
20 years (figure 4).2  Most participants saw the risks to 
their outlooks for real GDP growth and unemployment 
as broadly balanced, as the number of participants who 
viewed the risks to economic growth as weighted to the 
downside  and  the  risks  to  the  unemployment rate as 
2 Table 2 provides estimates of the forecast uncertainty for the 
change in real GDP, the unemployment rate, and total con-
sumer price inflation over the period from 1995 through 2014. 
At the end of this summary, the box “Forecast Uncertainty” 
weighted to the upside fell appreciably since September. 
Diminished risks to domestic economic activity from 
developments abroad and the strength of recent labor 
market data were among the reasons noted for the more 
upbeat assessment of risks. 
As in the September SEP, participants generally agreed 
that the levels of uncertainty associated with their infla-
tion forecasts were broadly similar to the average level 
over the past 20 years.  The number of participants who 
viewed the risks to their inflation forecasts as weighted 
to the downside declined slightly since September, and a 
majority now viewed the risks to both PCE and core 
PCE inflation as broadly balanced.  Among those who 
saw risks to inflation as tilted to the downside, several 
highlighted the continued strength of the dollar and 
some recent indications that inflation expectations had 
declined as contributing to their perception of those 
risks.

Note: For definitions of uncertainty and risks in economic projections, see the box “Forecast Uncertainty.” Defini-
tions of variables are in the general note to table 1.
Forecast Uncertainty 
The economic projections provided by the 
members of the Board of Governors and the 
presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks inform 
discussions of monetary policy among policy-
makers and can aid public understanding of the 
basis for policy actions.  Considerable uncer-
tainty attends these projections, however.  The 
economic and statistical models and relation-
ships used to help produce economic forecasts 
are necessarily imperfect descriptions of the 
real world, and the future path of the economy 
can be affected by myriad unforeseen develop-
ments and events.  Thus, in setting the stance 
of monetary policy, participants consider not 
only what appears to be the most likely eco-
nomic outcome as embodied in their projec-
tions, but also the range of alternative possibil-
ities, the likelihood of their occurring, and the 
potential costs to the economy should they oc-
cur. 
Table 2 summarizes the average historical 
accuracy of a range of forecasts, including 
those reported in past Monetary Policy Reports 
and those prepared by the Federal Reserve 
Board’s staff in advance of meetings of the 
Federal Open Market Committee.  The projec-
tion error ranges shown in the table illustrate 
the considerable uncertainty associated with 
economic forecasts.  For example, suppose a 
participant projects that real gross domestic 
product (GDP) and total consumer prices will 
rise steadily at annual rates of, respectively,     
3 percent and 2 percent.  If the uncertainty at-
tending those projections is similar to that ex-
perienced in the past and the risks around the 
projections are broadly balanced, the numbers 
reported in table 2 would imply a probability of 
about 70 percent that actual GDP would ex-
pand within a range of 2.1 to 3.9 percent in the  
current year, 1.2 to 4.8 percent in the second 
year, and 0.9 to 5.1 percent in the third and 
fourth years.  The corresponding 70 percent 
confidence intervals for overall inflation would 
be 1.8 to 2.2 percent in the current year, and     
1.0 to 3.0 percent in the second, third, and fourth 
years.  
Because current conditions may differ from 
those that prevailed, on average, over history, 
participants provide judgments as to whether 
the uncertainty attached to their projections of 
each variable is greater than, smaller than, or 
broadly similar to typical levels of forecast un-
certainty in the past, as shown in table 2.  Partic-
ipants also provide judgments as to whether the 
risks to their projections are weighted to the up-
side, are weighted to the downside, or are 
broadly balanced.  That is, participants judge 
whether each variable is more likely to be above 
or below their projections of the most likely out-
come.  These judgments about the uncertainty 
and the risks attending each participant’s projec-
tions are distinct from the diversity of partici-
pants’ views about the most likely outcomes.  
Forecast uncertainty is concerned with the risks 
associated with a particular projection rather 
than with divergences across a number of differ-
ent projections. 
As with real activity and inflation, the out-
look for the future path of the federal funds rate 
is subject to considerable uncertainty.  This un-
certainty arises primarily because each partici-
pant’s assessment of the appropriate stance of 
monetary policy depends importantly on the 
evolution of real activity and inflation over time.  
If economic conditions evolve in an unexpected 
manner, then assessments of the appropriate 
setting of the federal funds rate would change 
from that point forward.
