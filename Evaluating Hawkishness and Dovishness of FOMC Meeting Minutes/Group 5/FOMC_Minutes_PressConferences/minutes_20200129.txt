AUTHORIZATION FOR DOMESTIC OPEN MAR-
KET OPERATIONS 
(As reaffirmed effective January 28, 2020) 
OPEN MARKET TRANSACTIONS  
1. The Federal Open Market Committee (the “Com-
mittee”) authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve Bank 
selected by the Committee to execute open market trans-
actions (the “Selected Bank”), to the extent necessary to 
carry out the most recent domestic policy directive 
adopted by the Committee:   
A. To buy or sell in the open market securities that 
are direct obligations of, or fully guaranteed as to prin-
cipal and interest by, the United States, and securities 
that are direct obligations of, or fully guaranteed as to 
principal and interest by, any agency of the United 
States, that are eligible for purchase or sale under Sec-
tion 14(b) of the Federal Reserve Act (“Eligible Secu-
rities”) for the System Open Market Account 
(“SOMA”): 
i. As an outright operation with securities dealers 
and foreign and international accounts maintained 
at the Selected Bank:  on a same-day or deferred de-
livery basis (including such transactions as are com-
monly referred to as dollar rolls and coupon swaps) 
at market prices; or 
ii. As a temporary operation:  on a same-day or 
deferred delivery basis, to purchase such Eligible Se-
curities subject to an agreement to resell (“repo 
transactions”) or to sell such Eligible Securities sub-
ject to an agreement to repurchase (“reverse repo 
transactions”) for a term of 65 business days or less, 
at rates that, unless otherwise authorized by the 
Committee, are determined by competitive bidding, 
after applying reasonable limitations on the volume 
of agreements with individual counterparties; 
B. To allow Eligible Securities in the SOMA to ma-
ture without replacement;  
C. To exchange, at market prices, in connection 
with a Treasury auction, maturing Eligible Securities in 
the SOMA with the Treasury, in the case of Eligible 
Securities that are direct obligations of the United 
States or that are fully guaranteed as to principal and 
interest by the United States; and 
D. To exchange, at market prices, maturing Eligible 
Securities in the SOMA with an agency of the United 
States, in the case of Eligible Securities that are direct 
obligations of that agency or that are fully guaranteed 
as to principal and interest by that agency. 
SECURITIES LENDING 
2. In order to ensure the effective conduct of open 
market operations, the Committee authorizes the Se-
lected Bank to operate a program to lend Eligible Secu-
rities held in the SOMA to dealers on an overnight basis 
(except that the Selected Bank may lend Eligible Securi-
ties for longer than an overnight term to accommodate 
weekend, holiday, and similar trading conventions). 
A. Such securities lending must be: 
i. At rates determined by competitive bidding; 
ii. At a minimum lending fee consistent with the 
objectives of the program; 
iii. Subject to reasonable limitations on the total 
amount of a specific issue of Eligible Securities that 
may be auctioned; and 
iv. Subject to reasonable limitations on the 
amount of Eligible Securities that each borrower 
may borrow. 
B. The Selected Bank may: 
i. Reject bids that, as determined in its sole dis-
cretion, could facilitate a bidder’s ability to control a 
single issue;  
ii. Accept Treasury securities or cash as collateral 
for any loan of securities authorized in this para-
graph 2; and 
iii. Accept agency securities as collateral only for a 
loan of agency securities authorized in this para-
graph 2. 
OPERATIONAL READINESS TESTING 
3. The Committee authorizes the Selected Bank to 
undertake transactions of the type described in para-
graphs 1 and 2 from time to time for the purpose of test-
ing operational readiness, subject to the following limi-
tations: 
A. All transactions authorized in this paragraph 3 
shall be conducted with prior notice to the Commit-
tee; 
B. The aggregate par value of the transactions au-
thorized in this paragraph 3 that are of the type de-
scribed in paragraph 1.A.i, 1.B, 1.C and 1.D shall not 
exceed $5 billion per calendar year; and 
C. The outstanding amount of the transactions de-
scribed in paragraphs 1.A.ii and 2 shall not exceed 
$5 billion at any given time. 
TRANSACTIONS WITH CUSTOMER ACCOUNTS 
4. In order to ensure the effective conduct of open 
market operations, while assisting in the provision of 
short-term investments or other authorized services for 
foreign central bank and international accounts main-
tained at a Federal Reserve Bank (the “Foreign Ac-
counts”) and accounts maintained at a Federal Reserve 
Bank as fiscal agent of the United States pursuant to sec-
tion 15 of the Federal Reserve Act (together with the 
Foreign Accounts, the “Customer Accounts”), the Com-
mittee authorizes the following when undertaken on 
terms comparable to those available in the open market:  
A. The Selected Bank, for the SOMA, to undertake 
reverse repo transactions in Eligible Securities held in 
the SOMA with the Customer Accounts for a term of 
65 business days or less; and 
B. Any Federal Reserve Bank that maintains Cus-
tomer Accounts, for any such Customer Account, 
when appropriate and subject to all other necessary 
authorization and approvals, to:  
i. Undertake repo transactions in Eligible Securi-
ties with dealers with a corresponding reverse repo 
transaction in such Eligible Securities with the Cus-
tomer Accounts; and  
ii. Undertake intra-day repo transactions in Eligi-
ble Securities with Foreign Accounts. 
Transactions undertaken with Customer Accounts un-
der the provisions of this paragraph 4 may provide for a 
service fee when appropriate.  Transactions undertaken 
with Customer Accounts are also subject to the authori-
zation or approval of other entities, including the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and, when 
involving accounts maintained at a Federal Reserve 
Bank as fiscal agent of the United States, the United 
States Department of the Treasury. 
ADDITIONAL MATTERS 
5. The Committee authorizes the Chairman of the 
Committee, in fostering the Committee’s objectives dur-
ing any period between meetings of the Committee, to 
instruct the Selected Bank to act on behalf of the Com-
mittee to: 
A. Adjust somewhat in exceptional circumstances 
the stance of monetary policy and to take actions that 
may result in material changes in the composition and 
size of the assets in the SOMA; or  
B. Undertake transactions with respect to Eligible 
Securities in order to appropriately address temporary 
disruptions of an operational or highly unusual nature 
in U.S. dollar funding markets. 
Any such adjustment described in subparagraph A of 
this paragraph 5 shall be made in the context of the 
Committee’s discussion and decision about the stance of 
policy at its most recent meeting and the Committee’s 
long-run objectives to foster maximum employment and 
price stability, and shall be based on economic, financial, 
and monetary developments since the most recent meet-
ing of the Committee.  The Chairman, whenever feasi-
ble, will consult with the Committee before making any 
instruction under this paragraph 5. 
The Committee voted unanimously to reaffirm without 
revision the Authorization for Foreign Currency Opera-
tions and the Foreign Currency Directive as shown be-
low. 
AUTHORIZATION FOR FOREIGN CURRENCY 
OPERATIONS 
(As reaffirmed effective January 28, 2020) 
IN GENERAL 
1. The Federal Open Market Committee (the “Com-
mittee”) authorizes the Federal Reserve Bank selected by 
the Committee (the “Selected Bank”) to execute open 
market transactions for the System Open Market Ac-
count as provided in this Authorization, to the extent 
necessary to carry out any foreign currency directive of 
the Committee: 
A. To purchase and sell foreign currencies (also 
known as cable transfers) at home and abroad in the 
open market, including with the United States Treas-
ury, with foreign monetary authorities, with the Bank 
for International Settlements, and with other entities 
in the open market.  This authorization to purchase 
and sell foreign currencies encompasses purchases and 
sales through standalone spot or forward transactions 
and through foreign exchange swap transactions.  For 
purposes of this Authorization, foreign exchange 
swap transactions are:  swap transactions with the 
United States Treasury (also known as warehousing 
transactions), swap transactions with other central 
banks under reciprocal currency arrangements, swap 
transactions with other central banks under standing 
dollar liquidity and foreign currency liquidity swap ar-
rangements, and swap transactions with other entities 
in the open market. 
B. To hold balances of, and to have outstanding for-
ward contracts to receive or to deliver, foreign curren-
cies. 
2. All transactions in foreign currencies undertaken 
pursuant to paragraph 1 above shall, unless otherwise 
authorized by the Committee, be conducted:

garding exchange arrangements under Article IV of 
the Articles of Agreement of the International Mone-
tary Fund (IMF).1

tation, as appropriate, with the United States Treasury.  
C. In consultation, as appropriate, with foreign 
monetary authorities, foreign central banks, and inter-
national monetary institutions. 
D. At prevailing market rates. 
STANDALONE SPOT AND FORWARD TRANS-
ACTIONS 
3. For any operation that involves standalone spot or 
forward transactions in foreign currencies:  
A. Approval of such operation is required as fol-
lows: 
i. The Committee must direct the Selected Bank 
in advance to execute the operation if it would result 
in the overall volume of standalone spot and for-
ward transactions in foreign currencies, as defined 
in paragraph 3.C of this Authorization, exceeding 
$5 billion since the close of the most recent regular 
meeting of the Committee.  The Foreign Currency 
Subcommittee (the “Subcommittee”) must direct 
the Selected Bank in advance to execute the opera-
tion if the Subcommittee believes that consultation 
with the Committee is not feasible in the time avail-
able.  
ii. The Committee authorizes the Subcommittee 
to direct the Selected Bank in advance to execute the 
operation if it would result in the overall volume of 
standalone spot and forward transactions in foreign 
currencies, as defined in paragraph 3.C of this Au-
thorization, totaling $5 billion or less since the close 
of the most recent regular meeting of the Commit-
tee.   
B. Such an operation also shall be:   
i. Generally directed at countering disorderly 
market conditions; or 
ii. Undertaken to adjust System balances in light 
of probable future needs for currencies; or 
iii. Conducted for such other purposes as may be 
determined by the Committee. 
C. For purposes of this Authorization, the overall 
volume of standalone spot and forward transactions 
in foreign currencies is defined as the sum (disregard-
ing signs) of the dollar values of individual foreign cur-
rencies purchased and sold, valued at the time of the 
transaction. 
WAREHOUSING 
4. The Committee authorizes the Selected Bank, with 
the prior approval of the Subcommittee and at the re-
quest of the United States Treasury, to conduct swap 
transactions with the United States Exchange Stabiliza-
tion Fund established by section 10 of the Gold Reserve 
Act of 1934 under agreements in which the Selected 
Bank purchases foreign currencies from the Exchange 
Stabilization Fund and the Exchange Stabilization Fund 
repurchases the foreign currencies from the Selected 
Bank at a later date (such purchases and sales also known 
as warehousing).  
RECIPROCAL CURRENCY ARRANGEMENTS, 
AND STANDING DOLLAR AND FOREIGN 
CURRENCY LIQUIDITY SWAPS 
5. The Committee authorizes the Selected Bank to 
maintain reciprocal currency arrangements established 
under the North American Framework Agreement, 
standing dollar liquidity swap arrangements, and stand-
ing foreign currency liquidity swap arrangements as pro-
vided in this Authorization and to the extent necessary 
to carry out any foreign currency directive of the Com-
mittee.   
A. For reciprocal currency arrangements all draw-
ings must be approved in advance by the Committee 
(or by the Subcommittee, if the Subcommittee be-
lieves that consultation with the Committee is not fea-
sible in the time available). 
B. For standing dollar liquidity swap arrangements 
all drawings must be approved in advance by the 
Chairman.  The Chairman may approve a schedule of 
potential drawings, and may delegate to the manager, 
System Open Market Account, the authority to ap-
prove individual drawings that occur according to the 
schedule approved by the Chairman.   
C. For standing foreign currency liquidity swap ar-
rangements all drawings must be approved in advance 
by the Committee (or by the Subcommittee, if the 
Subcommittee believes that consultation with the 
Committee is not feasible in the time available). 
D. Operations involving standing dollar liquidity 
swap arrangements and standing foreign currency li-
quidity swap arrangements shall generally be directed 
at countering strains in financial markets in the United 
States or abroad, or reducing the risk that they could 
emerge, so as to mitigate their effects on economic 
and financial conditions in the United States. 
E. For reciprocal currency arrangements, standing 
dollar liquidity swap arrangements, and standing for-
eign currency liquidity swap arrangements: 
i. All arrangements are subject to annual review 
and approval by the Committee; 
ii.  Any new arrangements must be approved by 
the Committee; and 
iii. Any changes in the terms of existing arrange-
ments must be approved in advance by the Chair-
man.  The Chairman shall keep the Committee in-
formed of any changes in terms, and the terms shall 
be consistent with principles discussed with and 
guidance provided by the Committee. 
OTHER OPERATIONS IN FOREIGN CURREN-
CIES 
6. Any other operations in foreign currencies for 
which governance is not otherwise specified in this Au-
thorization (such as foreign exchange swap transactions 
with private-sector counterparties) must be authorized 
and directed in advance by the Committee. 
FOREIGN CURRENCY HOLDINGS 
7. The Committee authorizes the Selected Bank to 
hold foreign currencies for the System Open Market Ac-
count in accounts maintained at foreign central banks, 
the Bank for International Settlements, and such other 
foreign institutions as approved by the Board of Gover-
nors under Section 214.5 of Regulation N, to the extent 
necessary to carry out any foreign currency directive of 
the Committee. 
A. The Selected Bank shall manage all holdings of 
foreign currencies for the System Open Market Ac-
count:   
i. Primarily, to ensure sufficient liquidity to ena-
ble the Selected Bank to conduct foreign currency 
operations as directed by the Committee; 
ii. Secondarily, to maintain a high degree of 
safety; 
iii. Subject to paragraphs 7.A.i and 7.A.ii, to pro-
vide the highest rate of return possible in each cur-
rency; and 
iv. To achieve such other objectives as may be au-
thorized by the Committee. 
B. The Selected Bank may manage such foreign cur-
rency holdings by:  
i. Purchasing and selling obligations of, or fully 
guaranteed as to principal and interest by, a foreign 
government or agency thereof (“Permitted Foreign 
Securities”) through outright purchases and sales; 
ii. Purchasing Permitted Foreign Securities under 
agreements for repurchase of such Permitted For-
eign Securities and selling such securities under 
agreements for the resale of such securities; and 
iii. Managing balances in various time and other 
deposit accounts at foreign institutions approved by 
the Board of Governors under Regulation N.  
C. The Subcommittee, in consultation with the 
Committee, may provide additional instructions to the 
Selected Bank regarding holdings of foreign curren-
cies. 
ADDITIONAL MATTERS 
8. The Committee authorizes the Chairman:   
A. With the prior approval of the Committee, to en-
ter into any needed agreement or understanding with 
the Secretary of the United States Treasury about the 
division of responsibility for foreign currency opera-
tions between the System and the United States Treas-
ury; 
B. To advise the Secretary of the United States 
Treasury concerning System foreign currency opera-
tions, and to consult with the Secretary on policy mat-
ters relating to foreign currency operations;  
C. To designate Federal Reserve System persons au-
thorized to communicate with the United States 
Treasury concerning System Open Market Account 
foreign currency operations; and 
D. From time to time, to transmit appropriate re-
ports and information to the National Advisory Coun-
cil on International Monetary and Financial Policies. 
9. The Committee authorizes the Selected Bank to 
undertake transactions of the type described in this Au-
thorization, and foreign exchange and investment 
transactions that it may be otherwise authorized to 
undertake, from time to time for the purpose of testing 
operational readiness.  The aggregate amount of such 
transactions shall not exceed $2.5 billion per calendar 
year.  These transactions shall be conducted with prior 
notice to the Committee.  
10. All Federal Reserve banks shall participate in the 
foreign currency operations for System Open Market 
Account in accordance with paragraph 3G(1) of the 
Board of Governors’ Statement of Procedure with Re-
spect to Foreign Relationships of Federal Reserve Banks 
dated January 1, 1944. 
11. Any authority of the Subcommittee pursuant to 
this Authorization may be exercised by the Chairman if 
the Chairman believes that consultation with the Sub-
committee is not feasible in the time available.  The 
Chairman shall promptly report to the Subcommittee 
any action approved by the Chairman pursuant to this 
paragraph. 
12. The Committee authorizes the Chairman, in excep-
tional circumstances where it would not be feasible to 
convene the Committee, to foster the Committee’s ob-
jectives by instructing the Selected Bank to engage in 
foreign currency operations not otherwise authorized 
pursuant to this Authorization.  Any such action shall be 
made in the context of the Committee’s discussion and 
decisions regarding foreign currency operations.  The 
Chairman, whenever feasible, will consult with the Com-
mittee before making any instruction under this para-
graph. 
1 In general, as specified in Article IV, each member of the 
IMF undertakes to collaborate with the IMF and other mem-
bers to assure orderly exchange arrangements and to promote 
a stable system of exchange rates.  These obligations include 
seeking to direct the member’s economic and financial policies 
toward the objective of fostering orderly economic growth 
with reasonable price stability.  These obligations also include 
avoiding manipulating exchange rates or the international 
monetary system in such a way that would impede effective 
balance of payments adjustment or to give an unfair competi-
tive advantage over other members.

Review of Monetary Policy Strategy, Tools, and 
Communication Practices 
Participants continued their discussion related to the on-
going review of the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy 
strategy, tools, and communication practices.  At this 
meeting, the discussion focused on two topics:  the po-
tential interactions between monetary policy and finan-
cial stability and the potential use of inflation ranges 
around the Committee’s 2 percent inflation objective.  
The staff briefing on the first topic noted that in the cur-
rent environment of low neutral rates, achieving the 
Committee’s dual-mandate goals of maximum employ-
ment and price stability would require low policy rates 
frequently, regardless of the monetary policy strategy 
and tools chosen.  Consequently, policy strategies and 
tools that help support a stronger economy and anchor 
inflation expectations at a level consistent with the Com-
mittee’s objective in a low-neutral-rate environment can 
help promote financial stability.  In addition, the staff 
reported that the available empirical evidence suggests 
that the effects of changes in policy rates on asset prices 
and risk premiums tend to be modest relative to the his-
torical fluctuations in those measures.  However, there 
may be circumstances in which a persistently accommo-
dative policy stance that is otherwise consistent with the 
dual-mandate goals may contribute to an increase in fi-
nancial system vulnerabilities, including through in-
creased borrowing, financial leverage, and valuation 
pressures.  The staff noted that clear communications of 
the Committee’s ongoing assessments of the interac-
tions between monetary policy and financial stability 
could help avoid large interest rate surprises that could 
otherwise contribute to financial vulnerabilities.  The 
briefing concluded with a short review of how other cen-
tral banks have approached this issue, including the use 
of financial instability escape clauses to provide leeway 
for the central bank to deviate from its usual monetary 
policy strategy if financial vulnerabilities become signifi-
cant.   
In their discussion of the effects that alternative mone-
tary policy strategies and tools might have on financial 
stability, participants noted that macroeconomic stability 
and the achievement of the Committee’s dual mandate 
depended on a stable financial system.  An unstable fi-
nancial system may amplify shocks to the economy and 
exacerbate increases in unemployment or drive inflation 
further away from the Committee’s goal.  With respect 
to the relationship between monetary policy and finan-
cial stability, some participants noted that evidence re-
garding the link between the policy stance and elevated 
financial vulnerabilities was limited, with a couple of par-
ticipants further observing that there were not many ep-
isodes of persistently low interest rates.  In addition, 
some past episodes of heightened financial vulnerabili-
ties were associated with excessive risk-taking behavior 
that did not seem to be very responsive to typical 
changes in interest rates.  A number of participants 
judged that, under some circumstances, low policy rates 
might help foster financial stability provided they are 
needed to support strong economic conditions and price 
stability.  Some participants remarked, however, that 
keeping policy rates low to achieve both of the Commit-
tee’s dual-mandate objectives may contribute to a 
buildup of financial vulnerabilities, especially at times 
when the economy is at or above full employment, a de-
velopment that could pose future risks to the economy 
and to the ability of the Committee to achieve its dual 
mandate.  
Participants discussed how financial stability considera-
tions should be incorporated in the conduct of monetary 
policy.  They generally agreed that supervisory, regula-
tory, and macroprudential tools should be the primary 
means to address financial stability risks.  A few partici-
pants commented that this is especially the case when 
addressing risks associated with structural features such 
as the current low level of neutral interest rates.  A num-
ber of participants noted that countercyclical macropru-
dential tools, such as the countercyclical capital buffer, 
could be used to address cyclical financial stability risks.  
However, various participants noted that while these 
tools could be deployed proactively to lean against the 
buildup of financial vulnerabilities, they have some limi-
tations in the context of the U.S. financial system, where 
the few available tools are, for the most part, not de-
signed to address vulnerabilities outside the banking sec-
tor.  In addition, these tools are not within the authority 
of the Committee, and their use requires coordination 
with other prudential regulators.  Recognizing these lim-
itations, many participants remarked that the Committee 
should not rule out the possibility of adjusting the stance 
of monetary policy to mitigate financial stability risks, 
particularly when those risks have important implica-
tions for the economic outlook and when macropruden-
tial tools had been or were likely to be ineffective at mit-
igating those risks.  Nevertheless, many participants 
noted that the current knowledge of the interactions be-
tween the stance of monetary policy and financial vul-
nerabilities is too imprecise to warrant systematically ad-
justing monetary policy in response to the evolution of 
financial stability risks.  As a result, monetary policy 
should be guided primarily by the outlook for employ-
ment and inflation, and it should respond to financial 
stability risks only insofar as such risks significantly 
threaten the achievement of the Committee’s mandate.  
Several participants observed that the monetary policy 
measures needed to curb financial stability risks could be 
quite large, and the resulting effects on employment and 
inflation could place a high hurdle for such measures.  
Some participants remarked that, because financial sta-
bility risks are a consideration for achieving the Commit-
tee’s dual mandate, a clear communications strategy 
would be needed to convey the Committee’s assess-
ments of financial vulnerabilities and their potential im-
plications for the monetary policy outlook.  Several par-
ticipants noted that a communications strategy could in-
clude the possible use of financial instability escape 
clauses to help explain the rationale for policy actions 
when a buildup of financial vulnerabilities poses risks to 
the achievement of the Committee’s goals.   
The staff’s briefing on considerations regarding the use 
of an inflation range focused on three different concepts 
of an inflation range.  First, an uncertainty range could 
communicate the magnitude of the inherent variability 
of inflation that would still be consistent with achieving 
the Committee’s symmetric inflation objective.  Second, 
an operational range could signal that, under some condi-
tions, the Committee would prefer inflation to be away 
from its longer-run objective for a time; such a range 
could potentially be used as part of a makeup policy 
strategy, including one based on average inflation target-
ing, or in other strategies aimed at offsetting the adverse 
effects of a binding effective lower bound on policy 
rates.  Third, an indifference range could communicate that 
monetary policy would not respond to deviations of in-
flation within that range.  The briefing also summarized 
the experiences of foreign central banks that use infla-
tion ranges; these ranges were typically put in place many 
years ago, often in conjunction with adopting an infla-
tion target.  The staff highlighted the communications 
challenges that could arise if an inflation range were in-
troduced at a time when inflation had been running be-
low the central bank’s objective for a number of years. 
In this environment, the introduction of a symmetric 
range around the point objective could be misinter-
preted as a sign that the central bank was not concerned 
about inflation remaining below its stated goal, a situa-
tion that could lead to inflation expectations drifting 
down to the lower end of the range. 
Participants expressed a range of views on the potential 
benefits and costs of different types of inflation ranges.  
Most participants expressed concern that introducing a 
symmetric inflation range around the 2 percent objective 
following an extended period of inflation mostly running 
somewhat below 2 percent could be misperceived as a 
signal that the Committee was comfortable with contin-
ued misses below its symmetric inflation objective.  
Many participants agreed that an uncertainty range could 
be misinterpreted as an indifference range and hence as 
a lack of commitment by the Committee to its symmet-
ric 2 percent inflation objective.  Some participants sug-
gested that it was not clear that introducing a range 
would help much in achieving the Committee’s inflation 
objective; they noted that introducing a range could 
make that objective less clear to the public.  Instead of 
establishing a range, the Committee could continue to 
communicate that its inflation objective was symmetric 
around 2 percent.  While inflation is inherently variable, 
the Committee then could emphasize its intention for 
inflation to be centered on the 2 percent objective.  Nev-
ertheless, in view of the inherent variability of inflation, 
several participants judged that there could be some ben-
efit in communicating the inflation objective with a sym-
metric range around the point target.  In addition, a few 
participants suggested that an inflation range could con-
vey the uncertainty associated with the available array of 
inflation measures or that the Committee’s communica-
tions could more explicitly reference other measures of 
inflation.  Several participants also stated that employing 
an asymmetric operational range for a time—with 2 per-
cent being at or near the lower end of that range—while 
still maintaining the longer-run target of 2 percent could 
help communicate that the Committee intended infla-
tion to average 2 percent over time, which in turn could 
help keep longer-run inflation expectations at levels con-
sistent with its objective. 
Participants expected that, at upcoming meetings, they 
would continue their deliberations on the Committee’s 
review of monetary policy strategy, tools, and communi-
cation practices.  Participants continued to anticipate 
that the review will likely be completed around the mid-
dle of this year.  
Developments in Financial Markets and Open Mar-
ket Operations 
The SOMA manager reviewed developments in financial 
markets over the intermeeting period.  For most of the 
period, risk asset prices rose as market participants fo-
cused on a perceived reduction in downside risks to the 
economic outlook, favorable data on foreign economic 
activity, and expectations of continued monetary policy 
accommodation in the United States and other major 
economies.  Some market participants suggested that the 
Federal Reserve’s actions in the fourth quarter to main-
tain ample reserve levels might have contributed to some 
degree to the rise in equity and other risk asset prices. 
Over the final few days of the intermeeting period, fi-
nancial markets responded to news of the spread of the 
coronavirus that started in China, which reportedly con-
tributed to downward moves in Treasury yields and, to 
a lesser extent, U.S. equity prices.  On balance, U.S. fi-
nancial conditions became more accommodative over 
the intermeeting period, with equity prices rising nota-
bly.   
Despite signs of reduced risks to the outlook and of 
some stabilization in economic activity abroad, financial 
market participants’ views on the likely course of U.S. 
monetary policy appeared to have changed little over the 
intermeeting period.  Market-based indicators continued 
to point to expectations that the target range for the fed-
eral funds rate will be lowered by roughly 30 basis points 
this year.  This was consistent with responses to the 
Open Market Desk’s survey, which continued to indi-
cate that, while market participants viewed no change 
this year in the target range as the most likely outcome, 
they placed a higher probability on a reduction in the 
target range over the year than on an increase.  Market 
commentary attributed the stability in federal funds rate 
expectations despite the perceived reduction in down-
side risks partly to the Committee’s communications; 
some market participants reportedly regarded those 
communications as signaling a relatively high bar for 
changes to the target range.  In addition, results from the 
Desk’s surveys suggested that, notwithstanding the 
abatement in some risks over recent months, many mar-
ket participants continued to see risks to the economic 
outlook as skewed to the downside.   
The manager turned next to a review of money market 
developments and Desk operations.  The federal funds 
rate was stable over the year-end date and remained 
close to the interest on excess reserves (IOER) rate.  On-
going reserve management purchases of Treasury bills 
and the Desk’s repurchase agreement (repo) operations 
kept aggregate reserves above the level that prevailed in 
early September, contributing to relatively calm money 
market conditions around year-end.  Market participants 
cited funding from the additional longer-term repo op-
erations spanning year-end and increased capacity in 
daily operations as helping to maintain stable conditions 
in short-term funding markets.  In addition, market par-
ticipants prepared earlier than usual for year-end, with 
borrowers increasing their term borrowing from private 
lenders and lenders apparently expanding their lending 
capacity.   
Since year-end, money market rates remained stable, 
with the Desk’s longer-term repos maturing with no dis-
cernible effect on market conditions and reserve man-
agement purchases of Treasury bills proceeding 
smoothly.  At the current pace of $60 billion per month, 
the staff’s estimates suggested that after April of this 
year, the Desk’s reserve management purchases will re-
store the permanent base of reserves to levels above 
those prevailing in early September 2019.  Although re-
serves are projected to be above $1.5 trillion before 
April, a surge in the Treasury General Account balance 
during the April tax season is expected to briefly reduce 
reserve levels and, in the absence of repo operations, 
bring reserves down temporarily to around $1.5 trillion.  
The manager discussed a potential plan for gradually 
transitioning to an operational approach designed to 
maintain ample reserve levels without the active use of 
repo operations to supply reserves.  Under this plan, 
repo operations would be maintained at least through 
April to ensure ample reserve conditions.  However, the 
Desk would continue the gradual reduction and consol-
idation of its repo offerings ahead of April, with the plan 
of phasing out term repo operations after April.  As part 
of this transition, the minimum bid rate on repo opera-
tions could be gradually lifted, and the Committee could 
consider whether there is a role for repo operations in 
the implementation framework. 
In the second quarter, the manager expected reserve 
conditions to support slowing the pace of Treasury bill 
purchases, with the goal of eventually aligning growth of 
the Federal Reserve’s Treasury holdings with trend 
growth in its liabilities.  As that time approaches, the 
Committee might wish to consider the appropriate ma-
turity composition of reserve management purchases of 
Treasury securities.  The manager noted that, although 
the pace of Treasury purchases would likely continue 
into the second quarter, the rate of expansion in the Fed-
eral Reserve’s balance sheet would moderate during the 
first half of 2020 as repo outstanding was gradually re-
duced.   
The manager’s briefing addressed the possibility of a 
small technical adjustment to the Federal Reserve’s ad-
ministered rates in light of the stability in money market 
conditions over recent months.  With this adjustment, 
the Board would lift the interest rates on required and 
excess reserves by 5 basis points, and the FOMC would 
implement an equal-sized upward adjustment to the 
overnight reverse repurchase agreement offer rate.  This 
technical adjustment would reverse the small downward 
adjustment to administered rates made in September, 
when money markets were volatile.   
By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s 
domestic transactions over the intermeeting period.  No 
intervention operations occurred in foreign currencies 
for the System’s account during the intermeeting period. 
Staff Review of the Economic Situation 
The information available for the January 28–29 meeting 
indicated that labor market conditions remained strong 
and that real gross domestic product (GDP) increased at 
a moderate rate in the fourth quarter of 2019.  Consumer 
price inflation, as measured by the 12-month percentage 
change in the price index for personal consumption ex-
penditures (PCE), remained below 2 percent in Novem-
ber.  Survey-based measures of longer-run inflation ex-
pectations were little changed. 
Total nonfarm payroll employment rose in December, 
and the solid pace of job gains over the second half of 
2019 was somewhat above that for the first half.  How-
ever, the rate of increase in payrolls in 2019 was slower 
than in 2018, whether or not one accounted for the an-
ticipated effects of the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ bench-
mark revision to payroll employment, which was sched-
uled for early February.  The unemployment rate held 
steady at its 50-year low of 3.5 percent in December, and 
the labor force participation rate and the employment-
to-population ratio were unchanged as well.  The unem-
ployment rates for African Americans, Asians, Hispan-
ics, and whites were below their levels at the end of the 
previous economic expansion.  Although persistent dif-
ferentials between these rates remained, they have gen-
erally narrowed during the expansion.  The average share 
of workers employed part time for economic reasons in 
November stayed below its level in late 2007.  The rate 
of private-sector job openings declined, on net, in Octo-
ber and November but was still at a fairly high level; the 
rate of quits, which was also at a high level, edged up.  
The four-week moving average of initial claims for un-
employment insurance benefits through mid-January re-
mained near historically low levels.  Nominal wage 
growth was moderate, with average hourly earnings for 
all employees increasing 2.9 percent over the 12 months 
ending in December. 
Total consumer prices, as measured by the PCE price 
index, increased 1.5 percent over the 12 months ending 
in November.  Core PCE price inflation (which excludes 
changes in consumer food and energy prices) was 
1.6 percent over that same 12-month period.  Consumer 
food price inflation was lower than core inflation, and 
consumer energy prices declined.  The trimmed mean 
measure of 12-month PCE price inflation constructed 
by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas remained at 2 per-
cent in November.  The consumer price index (CPI) and 
the core CPI both rose 2.3 percent over the 12 months 
ending in December.  Recent readings on survey-based 
measures of longer-run inflation expectations were little 
changed, on balance, in recent months.  The University 
of Michigan Surveys of Consumers’ measure for the next 
5 to 10 years moved back up in early January after having 
fallen to its lowest value on record in December.  Mean-
while, the 3-year-ahead measure from the Federal Re-
serve Bank of New York’s Survey of Consumer Expec-
tations remained near its historical low in December. 
Real PCE appeared to have risen more slowly in the 
fourth quarter than in the third quarter.  Retail sales were 
soft during the fourth quarter, and sales of light motor 
vehicles declined in December after a strong gain in No-
vember.  However, key factors that influence consumer 
spending—including the low unemployment rate, the 
upward trend in real disposable income, high levels of 
households’ net worth, and generally low interest rates—
remained supportive of solid real PCE growth in the 
near term.  In addition, recent readings on consumer 
confidence from both the University of Michigan and 
the Conference Board surveys were strong. 
Real residential investment appeared to have increased 
solidly again in the fourth quarter.  Starts for single-fam-
ily homes increased sharply over the November and De-
cember period, building permit issuance for such homes 
rose on net, and starts of multifamily units also moved 
up.  Existing home sales increased, on balance, in No-
vember and December, while new home sales declined.  
All told, the data on residential construction and sales 
continued to suggest that the decline in mortgage rates 
since late 2018 had been boosting housing activity. 
The available data pointed to another decline in real non-
residential private fixed investment in the fourth quarter, 
with a further contraction in structures investment more 
than offsetting a modest rise in investment in equipment 
and intangibles.  Nominal shipments and new orders of 
nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft were little 
changed in the fourth quarter.  Although some measures 
of business sentiment improved, analysts’ expectations 
of firms’ longer-term profit growth edged down further, 
concerns about trade developments continued to weigh 
on firms’ investment decisions, and reduced deliveries of 
the Boeing 737 Max were likely restraining investment.  
Nominal business expenditures for nonresidential struc-
tures outside of the drilling and mining sector continued 
to decline in November.  The total number of crude oil 
and natural gas rigs in operation—an indicator of busi-
ness spending for structures in the drilling and mining 
sector—was little changed, on net, through mid-January, 
though still below levels seen over the latter part of 2019. 
Industrial production (IP) increased, on net, in Novem-
ber and December, partly because of a pickup in motor 
vehicle production following the strike at General Mo-
tors.  Even so, IP was lower than a year earlier, with de-
clines in manufacturing production and the output of 
utilities only partly offset by an increase in mining out-
put.  Automakers’ schedules suggested that assemblies 
of light motor vehicles would increase in the first quar-
ter, but that gain appeared likely to be offset by Boeing’s 
curtailed production of the 737 Max aircraft and, more 
generally, by mixed readings on new orders from na-
tional and regional manufacturing surveys. 
Total real government purchases appeared to have in-
creased moderately in the fourth quarter.  Nominal de-
fense spending in November and December pointed to 
only a moderate rise in real federal government pur-
chases.  Real purchases by state and local governments 
looked to have risen a little faster than in the third quar-
ter; nominal construction spending by these govern-
ments increased solidly in November, and state and local 
payrolls expanded modestly in December. 
Real net exports were estimated to have provided a sub-
stantial boost to real GDP growth in the fourth quarter.  
Available monthly data suggested that imports fell sig-
nificantly, led by declines in consumer goods and auto-
mobiles, while exports were about flat.    
Incoming data suggested that foreign economic growth 
slowed further in the fourth quarter to a very subdued 
pace.  In the advanced foreign economies (AFEs), 
growth appeared to have remained weak as the manu-
facturing slump continued and a consumption tax hike 
in Japan led to a sharp contraction in household spend-
ing.  In the emerging economies, social unrest weighed 
heavily on economic activity in Hong Kong and Chile, 
while the labor strike at General Motors was a further 
drag on Mexico’s already weak economy.  In contrast, 
early GDP releases showed a pickup in growth in China 
and some other Asian economies, though news of the 
coronavirus outbreak raised questions about the sustain-
ability of that pickup.  Foreign inflation rose in the wake 
of temporary factors in India and China, while it re-
mained soft in most AFEs, in part reflecting previous 
declines in energy prices and muted core inflation pres-
sures. 
Staff Review of the Financial Situation 
Investor sentiment improved, on balance, over the inter-
meeting period, mostly reflecting progress related to the 
phase-one trade deal between the United States and 
China and its subsequent signing, the perception that the 
probability of a disorderly Brexit had declined, signs of 
stabilization in the global economic outlook, and, report-
edly, continued confidence that monetary policy in the 
United States and other major economies would remain 
accommodative in the near term.  Late in the period, 
concerns about the spread of the coronavirus and uncer-
tainty about its potential economic effect weighed nega-
tively on investor sentiment and led to moderate declines 
in the prices of risky assets.  On net, equity prices in-
creased notably over the intermeeting period, while cor-
porate bond spreads were little changed and yields on 
nominal Treasury securities declined.  Financing condi-
tions for businesses and households eased a bit further 
and generally remained supportive of spending and eco-
nomic activity. 
Federal Reserve communications over the intermeeting 
period reportedly reinforced investors’ beliefs that a 
near-term change to the target range for the federal 
funds rate was unlikely.  Consistent with those reports, a 
straight read of the probability distributions for the fed-
eral funds rate implied by options prices suggested that 
investors assigned a high probability to the target range 
remaining unchanged over the next few months.  Expec-
tations for the federal funds rate at the end of 2020, as 
implied by overnight index swap quotes, moved down 
slightly, on net, and implied about a 30 basis point de-
cline in the federal funds rate from its current level. 
Yields on nominal Treasury securities declined, on net, 
across the maturity spectrum over the intermeeting pe-
riod, while the spread between the yields on nominal 
10- and 2-year Treasury securities was little changed.  
Measures of inflation compensation over the next 
5 years and 5 to 10 years ahead based on Treasury Infla-
tion-Protected Securities decreased, on net, but re-
mained above their October 2019 lows. 
Broad stock price indexes increased notably, on balance, 
over the intermeeting period, with gains largely at-
tributed to improved market sentiment about trade ne-
gotiations and a perceived lower probability of a disor-
derly Brexit.  Late in the period, equity prices retraced 
some of their gains, as concerns about the spread of the 
coronavirus weighed negatively on risk sentiment.  
Overall movements in stock prices varied widely across 
economic sectors, with stocks of firms in the infor-
mation technology and utilities sectors significantly out-
performing aggregate indexes, while stock prices of 
firms in the energy sector declined markedly.  Option-
implied volatility on the S&P 500 index increased a bit, 
on balance, while corporate credit spreads were little 
changed. 
Conditions in domestic short-term funding markets, in-
cluding in secured financing, were stable over the inter-
meeting period, even over year-end.  Rates declined 
slightly, likely reflecting increased liquidity and a higher 
level of reserves provided by the Desk’s open market 
operations.  The effective federal funds rate remained 
close to the IOER rate, and spreads for term unsecured 
commercial paper and negotiable certificates of deposit 
narrowed substantially, particularly after year-end.  The 
Desk’s open market operations proceeded smoothly. 
For most of the intermeeting period, foreign equity 
prices rose amid progress on U.S.–China trade negotia-
tions, generally favorable data on global economic activ-
ity, and the reduced risk of a disorderly Brexit following 
the U.K. general election.  Late in the period, however, 
concerns about the coronavirus outbreak in China 
weighed on risk sentiment.  On balance, most major for-
eign equity indexes increased modestly, and AFE long-
term sovereign yields ended the period somewhat lower.  
U.K. and Canadian yields declined more than elsewhere 
against the backdrop of central bank communications 
that were interpreted as increasing the likelihood of pol-
icy easing in those countries. 
The broad dollar index weakened slightly over the pe-
riod, predominantly against emerging market currencies.  
The Chinese renminbi appreciated notably against the 
dollar on positive trade policy developments, but this 
gain was more than undone late in the period by con-
cerns about the coronavirus.  The Mexican peso 
strengthened against the dollar, supported by progress 
on the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) and 
Bank of Mexico communications that were perceived as 
less accommodative than expected. 
Financing conditions for nonfinancial firms remained 
accommodative, on balance, with corporate borrowing 
costs staying near historical lows during the intermeeting 
period.  Gross issuance of investment-grade corporate 
bonds was subdued in January and December after surg-
ing in November.  Issuance of speculative-grade bonds 
over the intermeeting period remained about in line with 
the average pace over December and January in recent 
years.  Institutional leveraged loan issuance continued to 
be robust in December, reflecting solid refinancing ac-
tivity and moderate new money issuance.  Meanwhile, 
commercial and industrial (C&I) loans on banks’ balance 
sheets contracted in the fourth quarter.  Respondents to 
the January 2020 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey 
on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS) reported that bor-
rower demand weakened for C&I loans over the fourth 
quarter, and lending standards on such loans were little 
changed.  Gross equity issuance through seasoned offer-
ings remained robust in December, while initial public 
offerings continued to be quite light.  The credit quality 
of nonfinancial corporations and the earnings outlook 
remained generally stable in recent months.  Credit con-
ditions for both small businesses and municipalities re-
mained accommodative on net. 
In the commercial real estate (CRE) sector, financing 
conditions also remained generally accommodative.  The 
volume of agency and non-agency commercial mort-
gage-backed securities issuance grew notably in the 
fourth quarter, buoyed by lower interest rates, and the 
growth of CRE loans on banks’ books picked up over 
this period.  Responses to the January 2020 SLOOS sug-
gested that lending standards and demand for most CRE 
loan categories were unchanged in the fourth quarter. 
Financing conditions in the residential mortgage market 
remained accommodative on balance.  Mortgage rates 
decreased notably during the intermeeting period, reach-
ing recent-year lows.  Home-purchase originations re-
mained around post-crisis highs, and mortgage refinanc-
ing activity continued at a strong pace through Decem-
ber.   
Financing conditions in consumer credit markets re-
mained supportive of growth in consumer spending, al-
though the supply of credit remained relatively tight for 
nonprime borrowers.  The growth of credit card bal-
ances slowed in the fourth quarter, and, according to the 
January SLOOS, commercial banks tightened their 
standards on credit card loans over this period.  Auto 
loan growth maintained a solid pace in recent months 
amid declining interest rates through year-end.  
The staff provided an update on its assessments of po-
tential risks to financial stability.  On balance, the finan-
cial vulnerabilities of the U.S. financial system were char-
acterized as moderate.  The staff judged that asset valu-
ation pressures had increased in recent months to an el-
evated level.  Asset valuation pressures were character-
ized as fairly widespread across a number of markets, 
similar to the situation in much of 2017 and 2018.  In 
assessing vulnerabilities stemming from borrowing in 
the household and business sectors, the staff noted that, 
while the ratio of household debt to nominal GDP was 
fairly low, the ratio of business debt to nominal GDP 
was high by historical standards.  At the same time, ma-
jor financial institutions were viewed as resilient, in part 
because of high levels of capital at banks.  Nonetheless, 
the staff noted that banks had announced that they in-
tend to allow their capital ratios to decline closer to reg-
ulatory requirements over the medium term.  Vulnera-
bilities stemming from funding risk were characterized 
as moderate.  While the money market strains in Sep-
tember raised some questions about vulnerabilities in 
funding markets, the staff assessed that the core of the 
financial system remains resilient to vulnerabilities from 
maturity and liquidity transformation. 
Staff Economic Outlook 
The projection for U.S. real GDP growth prepared by 
the staff for the January FOMC meeting was stronger 
than in the previous forecast.  Data pertaining to the 
fourth quarter of 2019, particularly on imports, sug-
gested output rose faster at the end of the year than was 
previously projected, and this faster pace seemed con-
sistent with the solid employment gains in the fourth 
quarter.  In addition, more supportive financial condi-
tions and the anticipated effects of the phase-one trade 
deal between the United States and China pushed up the 
staff’s GDP forecast for this year and next.  All told, real 
GDP growth was projected to be about the same in 2020 
as in 2019 and then to slow modestly in the coming 
years, partly because of a fading boost from fiscal policy.  
Output was forecast to expand at a rate a little above the 
staff’s estimate of its potential rate of growth in 2020 and 
2021 and then to slow to a pace slightly below potential 
output growth in 2022.  The unemployment rate was 
projected to decline a little further this year and to re-
main at that lower level through 2022; the unemploy-
ment rate was anticipated to be below the staff’s estimate 
of its longer-run natural rate throughout the forecast pe-
riod. 
The staff’s forecasts for both total and core PCE price 
inflation over the 2020–22 period were essentially unre-
vised.  Core inflation was still projected to step up a little 
in 2020 but to run a bit below 2 percent both this year 
and over the next two years.  Total PCE price inflation 
was projected to be a little lower than core inflation in 
2020 because of a projected decline in consumer energy 
prices and to be the same as core inflation in 2021 and 
2022.  
The staff continued to view the uncertainty around its 
projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment 
rate, and inflation as generally similar to the average of 
the past 20 years.  The staff viewed the downside risks 
to economic activity as having diminished a bit further 
since the previous forecast but still judged that the risks 
to the forecast for real GDP growth were tilted to the 
downside, with a corresponding skew to the upside for 
the unemployment rate.  Important factors influencing 
this assessment were that foreign economic and geopo-
litical developments still seemed more likely to move in 
directions that could have significant negative effects on 
the U.S. economy than to resolve more favorably than 
assumed.  In addition, softness in business investment 
and manufacturing production last year, as well as the 
recent weakness in imports, was seen as pointing to the 
possibility of a more substantial slowing in economic 
growth than the staff projected.  The risks to the infla-
tion projection were also viewed as having a downward 
skew, in part because of the downside risks to the fore-
cast for economic activity. 
Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the 
Economic Outlook 
Participants agreed that the labor market had remained 
strong over the intermeeting period and that economic 
activity had risen at a moderate rate.  Job gains had been 
solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemploy-
ment rate had remained low.  Although household 
spending had risen at a moderate pace, business fixed 
investment and exports had remained weak.  On a 
12-month basis, overall inflation and inflation for items 
other than food and energy were running below 2 per-
cent.  Market-based measures of inflation compensation 
remained low; survey-based measures of longer-term in-
flation expectations were little changed. 
Participants generally judged that the current stance of 
monetary policy was appropriate to support sustained 
expansion of economic activity, strong labor market 
conditions, and inflation returning to the Committee’s 
symmetric 2 percent objective.  They expected economic 
growth to continue at a moderate pace, supported by ac-
commodative monetary and financial conditions.  In ad-
dition, some trade uncertainties had diminished recently, 
and there were some signs of stabilization in global 
growth.  Nonetheless, uncertainties about the outlook 
remained, including those posed by the outbreak of the 
coronavirus. 
In their discussion of the household sector, participants 
noted that spending growth had moderated in the fourth 
quarter.  However, they generally expected that, in the 
period ahead, consumption spending would likely re-
main on a firm footing, supported by strong labor mar-
ket conditions, rising incomes, and healthy household 
balance sheets.  Some participants noted the upbeat tone 
of consumer surveys, and a few commented that their 
District contacts had reported solid retail sales during 
the holiday shopping season.  In addition, many partici-
pants were encouraged by the significant pickup since 
last summer in residential investment, a development 
that reflected, in part, the effects of lower mortgage 
rates.  
With respect to the business sector, participants ob-
served that business investment and exports remained 
weak and that manufacturing output had declined over 
the past year.  Looking ahead, participants were generally 
cautiously optimistic about the effects on the business 
sector of the recent favorable trade developments and 
the signs of stabilization in global growth.  Many partic-
ipants expressed the view that these developments might 
boost business confidence or raise export demand, 
which would help strengthen or at least stabilize business 
investment.  A few participants remarked that contacts 
in their Districts had noted that business sentiment was 
brighter or that companies were intending to expand 
their capital expenditures this year.  Several other partic-
ipants, however, judged that the effect of the recent 
trade agreement with China would be relatively limited, 
as trade uncertainty would likely remain elevated, with 
the possibility remaining of the emergence of new ten-
sions as well as the reescalation of existing tensions.  
They noted that the agreement would still leave a large 
portion of tariffs in place and that many firms had al-
ready been making production and supply chain adjust-
ments in response to trade tensions. 
Participants also commented on ongoing challenges fac-
ing the energy and agriculture sectors.  A couple of par-
ticipants remarked that activity in the energy sector con-
tinued to be weak, and a few noted that financial condi-
tions in the agricultural sector would likely remain chal-
lenging for many despite farm subsidies from the federal 
government and recent optimism surrounding trade 
prospects. 
Participants judged that conditions in the labor market 
remained strong, with the unemployment rate at a 
50-year low and continued solid job gains, on average.  
Although the upcoming annual benchmark revision was 
expected to reduce estimates of recent payroll growth, 
participants expected payroll employment to expand at 
a healthy pace this year.  Business contacts in many Dis-
tricts indicated continued strong labor demand, with 
several participants mentioning that contacts reported 
difficulties in finding qualified workers or that observed 
wage growth might currently understate the degree of 
tightness in the labor market.  However, a number of 
participants indicated that aggregate measures of nomi-
nal wages continued to rise at a moderate pace broadly 
in line with productivity growth and the rate of inflation.  
Several participants commented on potential reasons for 
the absence of stronger broad-based wage pressures, in-
cluding technological changes that could substitute for 
labor, increased willingness of employees to forgo wage 
gains for greater job stability, adjustments in nonwage 
portions of compensation packages, and the possibility 
that the labor market was not as tight as the historically 
low unemployment rate would suggest.  Many partici-
pants pointed to the strong performance of labor force 
participation despite the downward pressures associated 
with an aging population, and several raised the possibil-
ity that there was some room for labor force participa-
tion to rise further. 
In their discussion of inflation developments, partici-
pants noted that recent readings on overall and core 
PCE price inflation, measured on a 12-month basis, had 
continued to run below 2 percent.  Overall, participants 
described their inflation outlook as having changed little 
since December.  Participants generally expected infla-
tion to move closer to 2 percent in the coming months 
as the unusually low readings in early 2019 drop out of 
the 12-month calculation.  Participants also expected 
that, as the economic expansion continues and resource 
utilization remains high, inflation would return to the 
2 percent objective on a sustainable basis.  A few partic-
ipants expressed less confidence in this outlook for in-
flation and commented that inflation had averaged less 
than 2 percent over the past several years even as re-
source utilization had increased, or pointed to down-
ward pressures from global or technology-related factors 
that could continue to suppress inflation.  A couple of 
participants, however, noted that some alternative infla-
tion indicators, including trimmed mean measures, sug-
gested that there had been a modest step-up in underly-
ing inflation during 2019 or that underlying inflation 
could already be at a level consistent with the Commit-
tee’s goal. 
Participants generally saw the distribution of risks to the 
outlook for economic activity as somewhat more favor-
able than at the previous meeting, although a number of 
downside risks remained prominent.  The easing of trade 
tensions resulting from the recent agreement with China 
and the passage of the USMCA as well as tentative signs 
of stabilization in global economic growth helped reduce 
downside risks and appeared to buoy business senti-
ment.  The risk of a “hard” Brexit had appeared to re-
cede further.  In addition, statistical models designed to 
estimate the probability of recession using financial mar-
ket data suggested that the likelihood of a recession oc-
curring over the next year had fallen notably in recent 
months.  Still, participants generally expected trade-re-
lated uncertainty to remain somewhat elevated, and they 
were mindful of the possibility that the tentative signs of 
stabilization in global growth could fade.  Geopolitical 
risks, especially in connection with the Middle East, re-
mained.  The threat of the coronavirus, in addition to its 
human toll, had emerged as a new risk to the global 
growth outlook, which participants agreed warranted 
close watching. 
In their discussion of financial stability, participants 
acknowledged the staff report suggesting that overall fi-
nancial vulnerabilities remained moderate and that the 
financial system remained resilient.  Nonetheless, several 
participants observed that equity, corporate debt, and 
CRE valuations were elevated and drew attention to high 
levels of corporate indebtedness and weak underwriting 
standards in leveraged loan markets.  Some participants 
expressed the concern that financial imbalances—in-
cluding overvaluation and excessive indebtedness—
could amplify an adverse shock to the economy, that the 
current conditions of low interest rates and labor market 
tightness could increase risks to financial stability, or that 
cyber attacks could affect the U.S. financial system.  Sev-
eral participants noted that planned increases in dividend 
payouts by large banks and the associated decline in cap-
ital buffers might leave those banks with less capacity to 
weather adverse shocks—which could have negative im-
plications for the economy—or that lower bank capital 
ratios could be associated with greater tail risks to GDP 
growth.  On the other hand, capital levels at U.S. banks 
were quite high relative to other sectors of the financial 
system, raising questions about the potential migration 
of lending activities away from the U.S. banking sector 
to areas outside the oversight of federal banking super-
visors. 
In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, 
participants judged that it would be appropriate to main-
tain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1½ to 
1¾ percent to support sustained expansion of economic 
activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation re-
turning to the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objec-
tive.  With regard to monetary policy beyond this meet-
ing, participants viewed the current stance of policy as 
likely to remain appropriate for a time, provided that in-
coming information about the economy remained 
broadly consistent with this economic outlook.  Of 
course, if developments emerged that led to a material 
reassessment of the outlook, an adjustment to the stance 
of monetary policy would be appropriate, in order to 
foster achievement of the Committee’s dual-mandate 
objectives. 
In commenting on the monetary policy outlook, partici-
pants concurred that maintaining the current stance of 
policy would give the Committee time for a fuller assess-
ment of the ongoing effects on economic activity of last 
year’s shift to a more accommodative policy stance and 
would also allow policymakers to accumulate further in-
formation bearing on the economic outlook.  Partici-
pants discussed how maintaining the current policy 
stance for a time could be helpful in supporting U.S. eco-
nomic activity and employment in the face of global de-
velopments that have been weighing on spending deci-
sions. 
With regard to the Committee’s price-stability objective, 
participants observed that the current degree of mone-
tary policy accommodation would be useful in facilitat-
ing a return of inflation to 2 percent.  Several participants 
noted that inflation returning to 2 percent would help 
ensure that longer-term inflation expectations remained 
consistent with the Committee’s longer-run inflation ob-
jective.  A few participants stressed that the Committee 
should be more explicit about the need to achieve its in-
flation goal on a sustained basis.  Several participants 
suggested that inflation modestly exceeding 2 percent 
for a period would be consistent with the achievement 
of the Committee’s longer-run inflation objective and 
that such mild overshooting might underscore the sym-
metry of that objective.  With regard to the Committee’s 
maximum employment objective, a few participants ob-
served that the actual level of employment might still be 
below maximum employment and that maintaining the 
present monetary policy stance would allow the econ-
omy to achieve that maximum level.  A couple of other 
participants expressed concern that tight labor markets 
have in the past been associated with economic and fi-
nancial imbalances and that the emergence of such im-
balances might jeopardize the longer-run attainment of 
the Committee’s dual-mandate goals. 
Participants discussed the open market operations that 
the Federal Reserve had undertaken since September to 
implement monetary policy, as well as forthcoming op-
erational measures.  Participants agreed that the opera-
tions undertaken by the Desk since mid-September had 
been effective in helping to stabilize conditions in money 
markets and that implementation of the plan that the 
Committee announced in October to purchase Treasury 
bills and conduct repo operations had proceeded 
smoothly.  Participants observed that enactment of this 
plan had succeeded in replenishing reserve balances to 
levels at or above those prevailing in early September 
2019 and in ensuring continued control of the federal 
funds rate.  Many participants stressed that, as reserves 
approached durably ample levels, the need for sizable 
Treasury bill purchases and repo operations would di-
minish and that such operations could be gradually 
scaled back or phased out.  Beyond that point, regular 
open market operations would be required over time in 
order to accommodate the trend growth in the Federal 
Reserve’s liabilities and maintain an ample level of re-
serves.  Participants who commented on the Desk’s pro-
posal for the transition to the ample-reserves regime in-
dicated that they were comfortable with that proposal.  
They remarked that the details of the Committee’s plans 
would be adjusted as appropriate to support effective 
implementation of monetary policy.  Participants noted 
that it would be important to continue to communicate 
to the public that open market operations now and in 
the period ahead were technical operations aimed at 
achieving and maintaining ample reserves and that any 
adjustments to those operations were not intended to 
represent a change in the stance of monetary policy.  
Several participants suggested that the Committee 
should resume before long its discussion of the role that 
repo operations might play in an ample-reserves regime, 
including the possible creation of a standing repo facility.  
A couple of these participants cited the potential for 
such a facility to reduce the banking system’s demand 
for reserves over the longer term. 
Committee Policy Action 
In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, 
members noted that information received since the 
FOMC met in December indicated that the labor market 
remained strong and that economic activity had been ris-
ing at a moderate rate.  Job gains had been solid, on av-
erage, in recent months, and the unemployment rate had 
remained low.  Although household spending had been 
rising at a moderate pace, business fixed investment and 
exports remained weak.  On a 12-month basis, overall 
inflation and inflation for items other than food and en-
ergy were running below 2 percent.  Market-based 
measures of inflation compensation remained low; sur-
vey-based measures of longer-term inflation expecta-
tions were little changed. 
Members agreed to maintain the target range for the fed-
eral funds rate at 1½ to 1¾ percent.  Members judged 
that the current stance of monetary policy was appropri-
ate to support sustained expansion of economic activity, 
strong labor market conditions, and inflation returning 
to the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective. 
Members also agreed that, in determining the timing and 
size of future adjustments to the target range for the fed-
eral funds rate, the Committee would assess realized and 
expected economic conditions relative to its maximum 
employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent infla-
tion objective.  And they concurred that this assessment 
would take into account a wide range of information, in-
cluding measures of labor market conditions, indicators 
of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and 
readings on financial and international developments. 
With regard to the postmeeting statement, members 
agreed that incoming data warranted a change in the 
statement’s description of recent rises in household 
spending from “strong” to “moderate.”  They also 
agreed to describe the current monetary policy stance as 
consistent with inflation “returning to,” rather than be-
ing “near,” their symmetric 2 percent longer-run objec-
tive.  In commenting on this change in wording, a few 
members noted that the new language would make the 
postmeeting statement more consistent with the Com-
mittee’s outlook or might usefully affirm the symmetry 
of the Committee’s inflation goal and indicate that poli-
cymakers were not satisfied with inflation outcomes that 
were persistently below 2 percent. 
At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee 
voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank 
of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute 
transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the fol-
lowing domestic policy directive, for release at 2:00 p.m.:   
“Effective January 30, 2020, the Federal Open 
Market Committee directs the Desk to under-
take open market operations as necessary to 
maintain the federal funds rate in a target range 
of 1½ to 1¾ percent.  In light of recent and 
expected increases in the Federal Reserve’s 
non-reserve liabilities, the Committee directs 
the Desk to continue purchasing Treasury bills 
at least into the second quarter of 2020 to 
maintain over time ample reserve balances at 
or above the level that prevailed in early Sep-
tember 2019.  The Committee also directs the 
Desk to continue conducting term and over-
night repurchase agreement operations at least 
through April 2020 to ensure that the supply of 
reserves remains ample even during periods of 
sharp increases in non-reserve liabilities, and to 
mitigate the risk of money market pressures 
that could adversely affect policy implementa-
tion.  In addition, the Committee directs the 
Desk to conduct overnight reverse repurchase 
operations (and reverse repurchase operations 
with maturities of more than one day when 
necessary to accommodate weekend, holiday, 
or similar trading conventions) at an offering 
rate of 1.50 percent, in amounts limited only by 
the value of Treasury securities held outright in 
the System Open Market Account that are 
available for such operations and by a per-
counterparty limit of $30 billion per day. 
The Committee directs the Desk to continue 
rolling over at auction all principal payments 
from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treas-
ury securities and to continue reinvesting all 
principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s 
holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-
backed securities received during each calendar 
month.  Principal payments from agency debt 
and agency mortgage-backed securities up to 
$20 billion per month will continue to be rein-
vested in Treasury securities to roughly match 
the maturity composition of Treasury securities 
outstanding; principal payments in excess of 
$20 billion per month will continue to be rein-
vested in agency mortgage-backed securities.  
Small deviations from these amounts for oper-
ational reasons are acceptable. 
The Committee also directs the Desk to engage 
in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as 
necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal 
Reserve’s agency mortgage-backed securities 
transactions.” 
The vote also encompassed approval of the statement 
below for release at 2:00 p.m.:   
“Information received since the Federal Open 
Market Committee met in December indicates 
that the labor market remains strong and that 
economic activity has been rising at a moderate 
rate.  Job gains have been solid, on average, in 
recent months, and the unemployment rate has 
remained low.  Although household spending 
has been rising at a moderate pace, business 
fixed investment and exports remain weak.  On 
a 12‑month basis, overall inflation and inflation 
for items other than food and energy are run-
ning below 2 percent.  Market-based measures 
of inflation compensation remain low; survey-
based measures of longer-term inflation expec-
tations are little changed. 
Consistent with its statutory mandate, the 
Committee seeks to foster maximum employ-
ment and price stability.  The Committee de-
cided to maintain the target range for the fed-
eral funds rate at 1½ to 1¾ percent.  The Com-
mittee judges that the current stance of mone-
tary policy is appropriate to support sustained 
expansion of economic activity, strong labor 
market conditions, and inflation returning to 
the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objec-
tive.  The Committee will continue to monitor 
the implications of incoming information for 
the economic outlook, including global devel-
opments and muted inflation pressures, as it as-
sesses the appropriate path of the target range 
for the federal funds rate. 
In determining the timing and size of future ad-
justments to the target range for the federal 
funds rate, the Committee will assess realized 
and expected economic conditions relative to 
its maximum employment objective and its 
symmetric 2 percent inflation objective.  This 
assessment will take into account a wide range 
of information, including measures of labor 
market conditions, indicators of inflation pres-
sures and inflation expectations, and readings 
on financial and international developments.” 
Voting for this action:  Jerome H. Powell, John C. 
Williams, Michelle W. Bowman, Lael Brainard, Richard 
H. Clarida, Patrick Harker, Robert S. Kaplan, Neel 
Kashkari, Loretta J. Mester, and Randal K. Quarles. 
Voting against this action:  None. 
Consistent with the Committee’s decision to leave the 
target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the 
Board of Governors voted unanimously to raise the in-
terest rates on required and excess reserve balances to 
1.60 percent.  Setting the interest rate paid on required 
and excess reserve balances 10 basis points above the 
bottom of the target range for the federal funds rate is 
intended to foster trading in the federal funds market at 
rates well within the FOMC’s target range.  The Board 
of Governors also voted unanimously to approve estab-
lishment of the primary credit rate at the existing level of 
2.25 percent, effective January 30, 2020. 
It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee 
would be held on Tuesday–Wednesday, March 17–18, 
2020. The meeting adjourned at 9:50 a.m. on January 29, 
2020. 
Notation Vote 
By notation vote completed on January 2, 2020, the 
Committee unanimously approved the minutes of the 
Committee meeting held on December 10–11, 2019.
