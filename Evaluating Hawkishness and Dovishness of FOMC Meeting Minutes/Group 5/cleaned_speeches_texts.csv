contributed to the increase in longterm unemployment the continued weakness in aggregate demand is likely the predominant factor', 'consequently the federal reserves accommodative monetary policies by providing support for demand and for the recovery should help over time to reduce longterm unemployment as well', 'recent labor market developments as background for my discussion let me provide a brief review of recent job market indicators', 'private payroll employment figure  increased by nearly  jobs per month on average in the three months ending in february and by about  jobs per month on average over the past  months', 'together with a lengthening of the average workweek these employment gains have contributed to a significant increase in aggregate hours worked figure', 'the government estimates payroll employmentthe number of jobsfrom a survey of businessesthe establishment survey', 'a monthly survey of about  households which provides the data needed to construct the national unemployment rate offers an alternative estimate of the number of jobs', 'employment as estimated from the household survey adjusted to correspond as closely as possible to the concept of employment measured in the establishment survey figure  also shows an improvement in the labor marketindeed by somewhat more than in the establishment survey', 'i should note however that monthtomonth changes in this measure are much more volatile than the employment measure from the establishment survey which is why the federal reserve puts more weight on the establishment survey for the purposes of shortterm forecasting', 'the positive signs from the labor market have shown through to measures of labor utilization after hovering around  percent for much of last year the unemployment rate figure  has moved down since september to . percent in february and the share of employment represented by people working part time for economic reasons an indicator of underutilization has declined modestly', 'surveys of households and firms about their attitudes and expectations offer yet another window on job market developments', 'other indicators such as new claims for unemployment insurance and measures of the breadth of hiring across industries also point to better labor market conditions', 'notwithstanding these welcome recent signs the job market remains quite weak relative to historical norms as ive already noted', 'after nearly two years of job gains private payroll employment remains more than  million jobs below its previous peak the jobs shortfall is even larger of course when increases in the size of the labor force are taken into account', 'and the unemployment rate in february was still roughly  percentage points above its average over the  years preceding the recession', 'the monthly increase in payroll employment which commands so much public attention is a net change', 'in contrast the increase in employment since the end of  has been due to a significant decline in layoffs but only a moderate improvement in hiring', 'to achieve a more rapid recovery in the job market hiring rates will need to return to more normal levels', 'the change in unemployment and economic growth a puzzle', 'what will lead to more hiring and consequently further declines in unemployment', 'the short answer is morerapid economic growth', 'indeed the improvement in the labor market over the past yearespecially the decline in the unemployment ratehas been faster than might have been expected given that the economy during that time appears to have grown at a relatively modest pace', 'that rule of thumb describes the observed relationship between changes in the unemployment rate and the growth rate of real gross domestic product gdp', 'okun noted that because of ongoing increases in the size of the labor force and in the level of productivity real gdp growth close to the rate of growth of its potential is normally required just to hold the unemployment rate steady', 'to reduce the unemployment rate therefore the economy must grow at a pace above its potential', 'more specifically according to currently accepted versions of okuns law to achieve a  percentage point decline in the unemployment rate in the course of a year real gdp must grow approximately  percentage points faster than the rate of growth of potential gdp over that period', 'so for illustration if the potential rate of gdp growth is  percent okuns law says that gdp must grow at about a  percent rate for one year to achieve a  percentage point reduction in the rate of unemployment', 'in light of this historical regularity the combination of relatively modest gdp growth with the more substantial improvement in the labor market over the past year is something of a puzzle', 'to illustrate the tension consider the relationship between the recent changes in the unemployment rate and in real gdp relative to the predictions of okuns law figure', 'as illustrated by the position of the square labeled  relative to the okuns law relationship represented by the line the decline in the unemployment rate over the course of  was greater than would seem consistent with gdp growth over that period', 'indeed with last years real gdp growth below  percent less than what most economists would estimate to be the u.s. economys potential rate of growth one might have expected little change in the unemployment rate last year or even a slight increase', 'what is this confluence of the significant decline in the unemployment rate and the modest recent increase in real gdp telling us about the state of the economy and how will the okuns law puzzle be resolved', 'for example gross domestic income an alternative measure of economic activity constructed using source data that are mostly different from the data used in estimating gdp provides some check on the information provided by the betterknown gdp measure', 'however gross domestic income is currently estimated to have increased less quickly than gdp in recent quarters and so does not point to an explanation of the drop in the unemployment rate', 'another logical possibility is that the decline in the unemployment rate could be overstating the improvement in the job market', 'because a person has to be either working or looking for work to be counted as part of the labor force an increase in the number of people too discouraged to continue their search for work would reduce the unemployment rate all else being equalbut not for a positive reason', 'for example a broad measure of labor underutilization that includes people only marginally attached to the labor force has declined about in line with the unemployment rate since late  figure', 'on balance an assessment of a broad range of indicators suggests that a substantial portion of the decline in the unemployment rate does reflect genuine improvement in labor market conditions', 'in  and  the decline in payrolls and the associated jump in unemployment were extraordinary', 'in particular using the okuns law metric the runup in the unemployment rate in  appears too large relative even to the substantial decline in real gdp that occurred', 'the open triangle labeled  in the upper left of the figure shows an increase in the unemployment rate in that year well above the one implied by the contraction in real gdp and okuns law', 'the diagram suggests that what we may be seeing now is the flip side of the feardriven layoffs that occurred during the worst part of the recession as firms have become sufficiently confident to move their workforces into closer alignment with the expected demand for their products', 'however to the extent that the decline in the unemployment rate since last summer has brought unemployment back more into line with the level of aggregate demand then further significant improvements in unemployment will likely require faster economic growth than we experienced during the past year', 'it will be especially important to evaluate incoming information to assess whether the recovery is picking up as improvements in the labor market feed through to consumer and business confidence or conversely whether the headwinds that have impeded the recovery to date continue to restrain the pace at which the labor market and economic activity normalize', 'the challenge of longterm unemployment discussions of the labor market at this juncture necessarily have a glass halfempty or halffull tone', 'recent improvements are encouraging but as i have noted in an absolute sense the job market is still far from normal by many measures and millions of families continue to suffer the daytoday hardships associated with not being able to find suitable employment', 'although most spells of unemployment are disruptive or costly the persistently high rate of longterm unemployment we have seen over the past three years or so is especially concerning', 'in this episode both the median and average durations of unemployment have reached levels far outside the range of experience since world war ii figure', 'and the share of unemployment that represents spells lasting more than six months has been higher than  percent since december  figure', 'by way of comparison the share of unemployment that was long term in nature never exceeded  percent or so in the severe  recession', 'those who have experienced unemployment know the burdens that it creates and a growing academic literature documents some dimensions of those burdens', 'surveys indicate that more than onehalf of the households experiencing long unemployment spells since the onset of the recent recession withdrew money from savings and retirement accounts to cover expenses onehalf borrowed money from family and friends and onethird struggled to meet housing expenses', 'unemployment also takes a toll on peoples health and may have longterm consequences for the families of the unemployed as well', 'in addition unemploymentespecially longterm unemploymentimposes important economic costs on everyone not just the unemployed themselves', 'elevated unemployment strains public finances because of both lost tax revenue and the payment of increased unemployment benefits and other income support to affected families', 'people unemployed for a long time have historically found jobs less easily than those experiencing shorter spells of unemployment perhaps because their skills erode they lose relationships within the workforce or they acquire a stigma that deters firms from hiring them', 'loss of skills and lower rates of employment reduce the economys overall productive capacity over the longer term', 'in the shorter term because the process of matching the longterm unemployed to jobs typically takes more time the currently high level of longterm unemployment might in itself be a reason that further progress in reducing the unemployment rate and thus in achieving a more complete recovery could be slow', 'a pessimistic view is that a large share of the unemployment we are seeing particularly the longerterm unemployment is structural in nature reflecting factors such as inadequate skills or mismatches between the types of skills that workers have and the skills that employers demand', 'if this view is correct then high levels of longterm unemployment could persist for quite a while even after the economy has more fully recovered', 'and it appears true that over the past two decades or so structural factors have been responsible for some increase in longterm unemployment', 'for example because an older worker who loses a job typically takes longer to find a new job than does a younger worker in the same situation the aging of the baby boom generation has probably contributed to a gradual rise in longterm unemployment', 'to the extent that higher rates of unemployment especially longterm unemployment result from structural factors the scope for countercyclical policies to reduce unemployment would be impaired and the benefits of a more complete economic recovery for many workers who are unemployed or discouraged would be more limited', 'however although structural shifts are no doubt important in the longer term my reading of the research is that at most a modest portion of the recent sharp increase in longterm unemployment is due to persistent structural factors', 'unsurprisingly the rate at which the longterm unemployed find work is lower than that of those who have been unemployed for only a short time on average over the period from  to  a bit more than onethird of those already unemployed for one to four weeks found employment within the next month', 'if the recent increase in longterm unemployment were being driven by structural factors rather than say the severity of the recession then the jobfinding rates of the longterm unemployed should have fallen sharply relative to those out of work for only a few weeks', 'this pattern is consistent with cyclical factors accounting for the bulk of the recent increase in longterm unemployment', 'similarly the fact that labor demand appears weak in most industries and locations is suggestive of a general shortfall of aggregate demand rather a worsening mismatch of skills and jobs', 'counterexamples like the energy boom in the upper midwest where there may be some mismatch in the geographic location of suitably skilled workers or an overall shortage of potential workers with relevant skills might best be interpreted as the exceptions that prove the rule a mismatch story would suggest that strong labor demand would be appearing in more sectors or geographical areas by now', 'that curvenamed after the british economist william beveridgecompares unemployment the number of workers looking for employers to job vacancies the number of workers that employers are seeking', 'in good times when the unemployment rate is low businesses are growing and workers are harder to find so job vacancies tend to be high', 'similarly in bad times unemployment is high and few jobs are available vacancies are low', 'thus the beveridge curve the relationship between unemployment and vacancies is downward sloping', 'on the usual interpretation a recession is a period in which the economy is moving down along the beveridge curve as output and the demand for labor fall job vacancies decline and unemployment rises', 'in contrast changes in the structural determinants of unemployment are thought to be reflected in shifts of the beveridge curve to the left or right', 'then for a given number of job openings the number of the unemployed who are qualified for those jobs is smaller and the unemployment rate is higher than it would have been before the mismatch problem worsened', 'from figure  we can see some outward shift in the relationship between job vacancies and unemployment consistent with some increase in structural unemployment since the onset of the recession', 'however a more indepth analysis of the evidence suggests that the apparent shift in the relationship between vacancies and unemployment is neither unusual for a recession nor likely to be persistent', 'this temporary outward shift during a deep recession may be the result of a particularly sharp increase in layoffs which raises unemployment quickly even as vacancies adjust more slowly', 'another possible explanation for a temporary shift in the beveridge curve is extended and emergency unemployment insurance which induces unemployed workers who might otherwise consider leaving the labor force to continue searching for work', 'in any case the data appear consistent with the shift in the vacancyunemployment relationship in recent years having been relatively modest and likely to reverse at least in part as the economy recovers further', 'when historical experience is taken into account these patterns do not support the view that structural factors are a major cause of the increase in unemployment during the most recent recession', 'conclusion to sum up a wide range of indicators suggests that the job market has been improving which is a welcome development indeed', 'still conditions remain far from normal as shown for example by the high level of longterm unemployment and the fact that jobs and hours worked remain well below precrisis peaks even without adjusting for growth in the labor force', 'notably an examination of recent deviations from okuns law suggests that the recent decline in the unemployment rate may reflect at least in part a reversal of the unusually large layoffs that occurred during late  and over', 'to the extent that this reversal has been completed further significant improvements in the unemployment rate will likely require a morerapid expansion of production and demand from consumers and businesses a process that can be supported by continued accommodative policies', 'i also discussed longterm unemployment today arguing that cyclical rather than structural factors are likely the primary source of its substantial increase during the recession', 'we must watch longterm unemployment especially carefully however', 'even if the primary cause of high longterm unemployment is insufficient aggregate demand if progress in reducing unemployment is too slow the longterm unemployed will see their skills and labor force attachment atrophy further possibly converting a cyclical problem into a structural one', 'if this hypothesis is wrong and structural factors are in fact explaining much of the increase in longterm unemployment then the scope for countercyclical policies to address this problem will be more limited', 'if structural factors are the predominant explanation for the increase in longterm unemployment it will become even more important to take the steps needed to ensure that workers are able to obtain the skills needed to meet the demands of our rapidly changing economy']"

acts to reduce interest rates which supports the economy by inducing businesses to invest more in new capital goods and by leading households to spend more on houses autos and other goods and services', 'likewise if the economy is overheating the fed can raise interest rates to help cool total demand and constrain inflationary pressures', 'following this standard approach the fed cut shortterm interest rates rapidly during the financial crisis reducing them to nearly zero by the end of a time when the economy was contracting sharply', 'at that point however we faced a real challenge once at zero the shortterm interest rate could not be cut further so our traditional policy tool for dealing with economic weakness was no longer available', 'yet with unemployment soaring the economy and job market clearly needed more support', 'to answer this question we could draw on the experience of japan where shortterm interest rates have been near zero for many years as well as a good deal of academic work', 'unable to reduce shortterm interest rates further we looked instead for ways to influence longerterm interest rates which remained well above zero', 'we reasoned that as with traditional monetary policy bringing down longerterm rates should support economic growth and employment by lowering the cost of borrowing to buy homes and cars or to finance capital investments', 'since  weve used two types of lesstraditional monetary policy tools to bring down longerterm rates', 'the feds purchases reduce the amount of longerterm securities held by investors and put downward pressure on the interest rates on those securities', 'that downward pressure transmits to a wide range of interest rates that individuals and businesses pay', 'for example when the fed first announced purchases of mortgagebacked securities in late  year mortgage interest rates averaged a little above percent today they average about  percent', 'other important interest rates such as corporate bond rates and rates on auto loans have also come down', 'lower interest rates also put upward pressure on the prices of assets such as stocks and homes providing further impetus to household and business spending', 'the second monetary policy tool we have been using involves communicating our expectations for how long the shortterm interest rate will remain exceptionally low', 'in sum the feds basic strategy for strengthening the economyreducing interest rates and easing financial conditions more generallyis the same as it has always been', 'the difference is that with the shortterm interest rate nearly at zero we have shifted to tools aimed at reducing longerterm interest rates more directly', 'last month my colleagues and i used both toolssecurities purchases and communications about our future actionsin a coordinated way to further support the recovery and the job market', 'though the economy has been growing since mid and we expect it to continue to expand it simply has not been growing fast enough recently to make significant progress in bringing down unemployment', 'at . percent the unemployment rate is nearly unchanged since the beginning of the year and is well above normal levels', 'while unemployment has been stubbornly high our economy has enjoyed broad price stability for some time and we expect inflation to remain low for the foreseeable future', 'so the case seemed clear to most of my colleagues that we could do more to assist economic growth and the job market without compromising our goal of price stability', 'we expect these purchases to put further downward pressure on longerterm interest rates including mortgage rates', 'to underline the federal reserves commitment to fostering a sustainable economic recovery we said that we would continue securities purchases and employ other policy tools until the outlook for the job market improves substantially in a context of price stability', 'in the category of communications policy we also extended our estimate of how long we expect to keep the shortterm interest rate at exceptionally low levels to at least mid', 'rather our message was that so long as price stability is preserved we will take care not to raise rates prematurely', 'specifically we expect that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the economy strengthens', 'now as i have said many times monetary policy is no panacea', 'it can be used to support stronger economic growth in situations in which as today the economy is not making full use of its resources and it can foster a healthier economy in the longer term by maintaining low and stable inflation', 'although monetary policy cannot cure the economys ills particularly in todays challenging circumstances we do think it can provide meaningful help', 'whats the relationship between monetary policy and fiscal policy', 'that brings me to the second question whats the relationship between monetary policy and fiscal policy', 'in short monetary policy and fiscal policy involve quite different sets of actors decisions and tools', 'fiscal policy determines the size of the federal budget deficit which is the difference between federal spending and revenues in a year', 'borrowing to finance budget deficits increases the governments total outstanding debt', 'as i have discussed monetary policy is the responsibility of the federal reserveor more specifically the federal open market committee which includes members of the federal reserves board of governors and presidents of federal reserve banks', 'unlike fiscal policy monetary policy does not involve any taxation transfer payments or purchases of goods and services', 'instead as i mentioned monetary policy mainly involves the purchase and sale of securities', 'the securities that the fed purchases in the conduct of monetary policy are held in our portfolio and earn interest', 'the great bulk of these interest earnings is sent to the treasury thereby helping reduce the government deficit', 'so the odds are high that the purchase programs that the fed has undertaken in support of the recovery will end up reducing not increasing the federal debt both through the interest earnings we send the treasury and because a stronger economy tends to lead to higher tax revenues and reduced government spending on unemployment benefits for example', 'even though our activities are likely to result in a lower national debt over the long term i sometimes hear the complaint that the federal reserve is enabling bad fiscal policy by keeping interest rates very low and thereby making it cheaper for the federal government to borrow', 'at the federal reserve we implement policy to promote maximum employment and price stability as the law under which we operate requires', 'using monetary policy to try to influence the political debate on the budget would be highly inappropriate', 'for what its worth i think the strategy would also likely be ineffective suppose notwithstanding our legal mandate the federal reserve were to raise interest rates for the purpose of making it more expensive for the government to borrow', 'such an action would substantially increase the deficit not only because of higher interest rates but also because the weaker recovery that would result from premature monetary tightening would further widen the gap between spending and revenues', 'it seems likely that a significant widening of the deficitwhich would make the needed fiscal actions even more difficult and painfulwould worsen rather than improve the prospects for a comprehensive fiscal solution', 'achieving these fiscal goals would be even more difficult if monetary policy were not helping support the economic recovery', 'what is the risk that the federal reserves monetary policy will lead to inflation', 'a third question and an important one is whether the federal reserves monetary policy will lead to higher inflation down the road', 'in response i will start by pointing out that the federal reserves price stability record is excellent and we are fully committed to maintaining it', 'inflation has averaged close to  percent per year for several decades and thats about where it is today', 'in particular the low interest rate policies the fed has been following for about five years now have not led to increased inflation', 'moreover according to a variety of measures the publics expectations of inflation over the long run remain quite stable within the range that they have been for many years', 'with monetary policy being so accommodative now though it is not unreasonable to ask whether we are sowing the seeds of future inflation', 'a related question i sometimes hearwhich bears also on the relationship between monetary and fiscal policy is this by buying securities are you monetizing the debtprinting money for the government to useand will that inevitably lead to higher inflation', 'in contrast we are acquiring treasury securities on the open market and only on a temporary basis with the goal of supporting the economic recovery through lower interest rates', 'for controlling inflation the key question is whether the federal reserve has the policy tools to tighten monetary conditions at the appropriate time so as to prevent the emergence of inflationary pressures down the road', 'for example the fed can tighten policy even if our balance sheet remains large by increasing the interest rate we pay banks on reserve balances they deposit at the fed', 'i can assure you that my colleagues and i will carefully consider how best to foster both of our mandated objectives maximum employment and price stability when the time comes to make these decisions', 'how does the feds monetary policy affect savers and investors', 'the concern about possible inflation is a concern about the future', 'one concern in the here and now is about the effect of low interest rates on savers and investors', 'my colleagues and i know that people who rely on investments that pay a fixed interest rate such as certificates of deposit are receiving very low returns a situation that has involved significant hardship for some', 'however i would encourage you to remember that the current low levels of interest rates while in the first instance a reflection of the federal reserves monetary policy are in a larger sense the result of the recent financial crisis the worst shock to this nations financial system since the s', 'interest rates are low throughout the developed world except in countries experiencing fiscal crises as central banks and other policymakers try to cope with continuing financial strains and weak economic conditions', 'the crisis and recession have led to very low interest rates it is true but these events have also destroyed jobs hamstrung economic growth and led to sharp declines in the values of many homes and businesses', 'without a job it is difficult to save for retirement or to buy a home or to pay for an education irrespective of the current level of interest rates', 'the way for the fed to support a return to a strong economy is by maintaining monetary accommodation which requires low interest rates for a time', 'if in contrast the fed were to raise rates now before the economic recovery is fully entrenched house prices might resume declines the values of businesses large and small would drop and critically unemployment would likely start to rise again', 'in the federal reserve act and subsequent legislation the congress laid out the central banks goals and powers and the fed is responsible to the congress for meeting its mandated objectives including fostering maximum employment and price stability', 'research and practical experience have established that freeing the central bank from shortterm political pressures leads to better monetary policy because it allows policymakers to focus on what is best for the economy in the longer run independently of nearterm electoral or partisan concerns', 'all of the members of the federal open market committee take this principle very seriously and strive always to make monetary policy decisions based solely on factual evidence and careful analysis', 'it is important to keep politics out of monetary policy decisions but it is equally important in a democracy for those decisionsand indeed all of the federal reserves decisions and actionsto be undertaken in a strong framework of accountability and transparency', 'one of my principal objectives as chairman has been to make monetary policy at the federal reserve as transparent as possible', 'i hold news conferences four times a year and testify often before congressional committees including twiceyearly appearances that are specifically designated for the purpose of my presenting a comprehensive monetary policy report to the congress', 'while the gao has access to all aspects of the feds operations and is free to criticize or make recommendations there is one important exception monetary policymaking', 'in the s the congress deliberately excluded monetary policy deliberations decisions and actions from the scope of gao reviews', 'in doing so the congress carefully balanced the need for democratic accountability with the benefits that flow from keeping monetary policy free from shortterm political pressures', 'however there have been recent proposals to expand the authority of the gao over the federal reserve to include reviews of monetary policy decisions', 'because the gao is the investigative arm of the congress and gao reviews may be initiated at the request of members of the congress these reviews or the prospect of reviews of individual policy decisions could be seen with good reason as efforts to bring political pressure to bear on monetary policymakers', 'a perceived politicization of monetary policy would reduce public confidence in the ability of the federal reserve to make its policy decisions based strictly on what is good for the economy in the longer term', 'balancing the need for accountability against the goal of insulating monetary policy from shortterm political pressure is very important and i believe that the congress had it right in the s when it explicitly chose to protect monetary policy decisionmaking from the possibility of politically motivated reviews']"

may perceive themselves to be vulnerable to asset bubbles and financial imbalances caused by heavy and volatile capital inflows including those arising from low interest rates in the advanced economies', 'regarding the effects of monetary easing on exchange rates and exports i would note that tradeweighted real exchange rates of emerging market economies with some exceptions have not changed much from their values shortly before the intensification of the financial crisis in late', 'moreover even if the expansionary policies of the advanced economies were to lead to significant currency appreciation in emerging markets the resulting drag on their competitiveness would have to be balanced against the positive effects of stronger advancedeconomy demand', 'a return to solid growth among the advanced economies is ultimately in the interest of advanced and emerging market economies alike', 'regarding capital flows it is true that interest rate differentials associated with differences in national monetary policies can promote crossborder capital flows as investors seek higher returns', 'but my reading of recent research makes me skeptical that these policy differences

were redeemable in gold on demand and the fed was required to maintain a gold reserve equal to  percent of outstanding notes', 'this practice together with the size of the u.s. economy gave the federal reserve considerable autonomy in monetary policy and in particular allowed the fed to conduct policy according to the real bills doctrine without much hindrance', 'although the gold standard did not appear to have greatly constrained u.s. monetary policy in the years after the feds founding subsequent research has highlighted the extent to which the international gold standard served to destabilize the global economy in the late s and early s', 'likewise economic historians have pointed out that under the real bills doctrine the fed increased the money supply precisely at those times at which business activity and upward pressures on prices were strongest that is monetary policy was procyclical', 'thus the feds actions tended to increase rather than decrease the volatility in economic activity and prices', 'initially the feds main tools were the quantity of its lending through the discount window and the interest rate at which it lent the discount rate', 'subsequently of course open market operations became a principal monetary policy tool one that allowed the fed to interact with the broader financial markets not only with banks', 'economists have also identified a

inaction', 'whether valid or not this hypothesis raises the interesting question of what intellectual framework an effective leader would have drawn on at the time to develop and justify a more activist monetary policy', 'the degree to which the gold standard actually constrained u.s. monetary policy during the early s is debated but the gold standard philosophy clearly did not encourage the

objective for the federal government', 'although the fed did not have a formal employment goal until the federal reserve reform act of  codified maximum employment along with stable prices as part of

example because investors can choose freely between holding a longerterm security or rolling over a sequence of shortterm securities longerterm interest rates today are closely linked to market participants expectations of how shortterm rates will evolve', 'if monetary policymakers are expected to keep shortterm interest rates low then current longerterm interest rates are likely to be low as well all else being equal', 'in short for monetary policy expectations matter', 'for example over the past two decades many central banks have introduced explicit numerical targets for inflation', 'supplemented by regular publication of the central banks economic forecasts and provisional plans for achieving its objective in the medium term numerical inflation goals have helped increase the transparency and predictability of policy in a number of economies', 'because of its dual mandate from the congress which specifies both maximum employment and price stability as policy objectives the federal reserve could not adopt a numerical inflation target as its exclusive goal', 'nor would it have been appropriate for the fomc simply to provide a fixed objective for some measure of employment or unemployment in parallel with an inflation objective', 'in contrast to inflation which is determined by monetary policy in the longer run the maximum level of employment that can be sustained over the longer run is determined primarily by nonmonetary factors such as demographics the mix of workforce skills labor market institutions and advances in technology', 'moreover as these factors evolve the maximum employment level may change over time', 'consequently it is beyond the power of the central bank to set a longerrun target for employment that is immutable or independent of the underlying structure of the economy', 'it then indicates that in the context of the fomcs dual mandate the committee sees price stability as corresponding to a  percent longerterm inflation goal', 'on the employment side of the mandate the committee makes its best assessment of the maximum level of employment at any given time recognizing that such assessments are necessarily uncertain and subject to revision', 'in practice the committee often expresses its employment objective in terms of the longerrun normal rate of unemployment', 'currently fomc participants estimates of the longerrun normal unemployment rate as publicly reported in the quarterly summary of economic projections range from . to  percent', 'although the size and diversity of the federal reserves policymaking committee has made achieving a single consensus forecast difficult the quarterly summary of economic projections reports each fomc participants view of the most likely future paths of inflation unemployment and output growth conditional on that individuals view of appropriate monetary policy', 'in recent years this survey has also included participants projections of the path of future shortterm interest rates they see as most likely to achieve the committees goals', 'in general the committees two objectives of maximum employment and price stability are complementary', 'when they are not the fomc has stated that it will pursue a balanced approach in the pursuit of its dual mandate working to ensure that both inflation and employment are close to their desired values in the longer term', 'the financial crisis and its aftermath however have raised even greater challenges for and demands on the federal reserves communication', 'we have had to contend with the persistent effects of the seizingup of the financial system the collapse of housing prices and construction new financial shocks in europe and elsewhere restrictive fiscal policies at all levels of government and of course the enormous blows to output and employment associated with the worst u.s. recession since the great depression', 'moreover for the first time since the fomc began using the federal funds rate as its policy interest rate that rate is effectively at zero and thus cannot be lowered meaningfully further', 'in the remainder of my talk i will discuss how the federal reserve has used communication to try to further inform the publics expectations about how the fomc will employ what are currently its two principal policy tools its plans regarding its shortterm policy interest rate and its largescale purchases of securities', 'forward guidance about policy interest rates as the economy weakened over  the fomc repeatedly cut its target for the federal funds rate its shortterm policy rate', 'thus using the standard means of further easing monetary policycutting the target interest ratewas no longer possible', 'the socalled zero lower bound on the fomcs policy interest rate was not the only challenge the committee faced', 'first the depth of the recession combined with ongoing concerns about the functioning of the financial system raised significant uncertainties about both the likely pace of recovery and the effectiveness of monetary policy in supporting growth', 'the recoveries from most postworld war ii u.s. recessions had been relatively rapid with production unemployment and other key variables returning to close to normal levels within six to eight quarters', 'on the one hand if the economy were to recover rapidly and inflation were to increase monetary policymakers would be able to respond in the normal way by raising the federal funds rate', 'moreover in the latter case the economy could face an increased risk of deflationfalling prices', 'as the case of japan illustrates deflation may impede economic growth while being very difficult to escape', 'to try to preempt such outcomes a strong case existed for monetary policy to be more accommodative than suggested by standard policy rules calibrated to normal times', 'so the committee faced a situation in which more monetary policy accommodation was needed and possibly for quite a long timeyet its basic policy tool the federal funds rate target had been pushed to its limit', 'fortunately as i discussed earlier the degree of accommodation provided by monetary policy depends not just on the current value of the policy rate but on public expectations of future settings of that rate', 'in particular following the introduction of dates into the fomc statement interest rates and survey measures of policy expectations moved in ways broadly consistent with the guidance', 'introducing socalled statecontingent guidance the committee announced for the first time that no increase in the federal funds rate target should be anticipated so long as unemployment remained above  percent and inflation and inflation expectations remained stable and near target', 'this threshold formulation helps explain why the committee was willing to express the guidance bearing on the labor market in terms of the unemployment rate alone instead of following its usual practice of considering a broad range of labor market indicators', 'in the judgment of the committee the unemployment ratewhich despite some drawbacks in this regard is probably the best single summary indicator of the state of the labor marketis sufficient for defining the threshold given by the guidance', 'however after the unemployment threshold is crossed many other indicators become relevant to a comprehensive judgment of the health of the labor market including such measures as payroll employment labor force participation and the rates of hiring and separation', 'in particular even after unemployment drops below  percent and so long as inflation remains well behaved the committee can be patient in seeking assurance that the labor market is sufficiently strong before considering any increase in its target for the federal funds rate', 'largescale asset purchases and related communication because of the severity of the recession and the disruptions in financial markets and because shortterm interest rates were near the zero lower bound it became clear early on that more monetary accommodation would be needed than could be provided through the management of shortterm rates alone even with guidance that those rates would be kept low well into the future', 'both lsaps and forward guidance for the federal funds rate support the economy by putting downward pressure on longerterm interest rates but they affect longerterm rates through somewhat different channels', 'to understand the difference it is useful to decompose longerterm interest rates into two components one reflects the expected path of shortterm interest rates and the other is called a term premium', 'as i have noted forward rate guidance affects longerterm interest rates primarily by influencing investors expectations of future shortterm interest rates', 'consequently their yields should fall as investors demand a smaller term premium for holding them', 'as both forward rate guidance and lsaps affect longerterm interest rates the use of these tools allows monetary policy to be effective even when shortterm interest rates are close to zero', 'moreover economists do not have as good an understanding as we would like of the factors determining term premiums indeed as we saw earlier this year hardtopredict shifts in term premiums can be a source of significant volatility in interest rates and financial conditions', 'of course elevated unemployment belowtarget inflation lingering economic fragility and the harmful effects of longterm unemployment on our society and economic potential also pose significant costs and risks and the committee has thus far judged that the balance favors the use of lsaps', 'in particular the committee initiated purchases of agency mbs at the rate of  billion per month and stated its intention to continue purchases until the outlook for the labor market improved substantially in a context of price stability', 'the committee also signaled its expectation that it would end the purchases and return to an emphasis on rates policy and forward guidance before it had fully attained its dual mandate objectives stating that the committee expects that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens', 'the reason for this sequencing choice again was the greater uncertainty about the costs and efficacy of lsaps relative to the more familiar tool of managing the current shortterm interest rate and through forward guidance expectations of future shortterm interest rates', 'in particular i noted the committees expectation at the time that improvements in the job market would continue supported by a moderate pickup in growth that would support those gains', 'the committee additionally expected that inflation would be moving back toward its  percent objective over time', 'financial market movements are often difficult to account for even after the fact but three main reasons seem to explain the rise in interest rates over the summer', 'the committee was looking for evidence that job market gains would continue supported by a pickup in growth', 'although the fomcs decision came as a surprise to some market participants it appears to have strengthened the credibility of the committees forward rate guidance in particular following the decision longerterm rates fell and expectations of shortterm rates derived from financial market prices showed and continue to show a pattern more consistent with the guidance', 'at the time the latest reading on the unemployment rate was . percent and both we and most privatesector economists were projecting only slow reductions in unemployment in the coming quarters', 'recent reports on payroll employment had also been somewhat disappointing', 'however since the program was announced the unemployment rate has fallen . percentage point and about . million payroll jobs have been added', 'as reflected in the latest summary of economic projections and the october fomc statement the fomc still expects that labor market conditions will continue to improve and that inflation will move toward the  percent objective over the medium term', 'when ultimately asset purchases do slow it will likely be because the economy has progressed sufficiently for the committee to rely more heavily on its rate policies the associated forward guidance and its substantial continued holdings of securities to maintain progress toward maximum employment and to achieve price stability', 'in particular the target for the federal funds rate is likely to remain near zero for a considerable time after the asset purchases end perhaps well after the unemployment threshold is crossed and at least until the preponderance of the data supports the beginning of the removal of policy accommodation', 'conclusion i began my time as chairman with the goal of increasing the transparency of the federal reserve and of monetary policy in particular', 'in response to a financial crisis and a deep recession the feds monetary policy communications have proved far more important and have evolved in different ways than i would have envisioned eight years ago', 'however we are still far from where we would like to be and consequently it may be some time before monetary policy returns to more normal settings', 'i agree with the sentiment expressed by my colleague janet yellen at her testimony last week that the surest path to a more normal approach to

policy', 'i had long advocated increased transparency and in particular a more explicit policy framework as ways to make monetary policy more predictable and more effective', 'our efforts to enhance transparency and communication have indeed made monetary policy more effective but as ill discuss these steps have proved important in other spheres as well', 'when i began my term i expected to build on the monetary policy framework i had inherited from paul volcker and alan greenspan', 'my predecessors had solidified the feds commitment to low and stable inflation as a foundation of broader economic stability and they gradually increased the transparency of monetary policy deliberations and plans', 'for example chairman volcker introduced a moneytargeting framework to help guide the feds attack on high inflation in the early s and the practice of issuing a statement after each meeting of the federal open market committee fomc began under chairman greenspan', 'i believed that a still more transparent approach would make monetary policy even more effective and further strengthen the feds institutional credibility', 'in particular as an academic i had written favorably about the flexible inflationtargeting approach used by the bank of england and a number of other central banks', 'i was confident that we could adapt this type of framework to the federal reserves dual mandate to promote both maximum employment and price stability', 'indeed central banks using this framework were already in practice often pursuing economic objectives in addition to low and stable inflationhence the term flexible inflation targeting', 'in the minutes of its october  meeting the fomc introduced its quarterly summary of economic projections sep which included fomc participants projections of key macroeconomic variables such as inflation gross domestic product gdp growth and the unemployment rate', 'over time we added longrun projections of inflation growth and unemployment as well as projections of the path of the target federal funds rate consistent with each individuals views of appropriate monetary policy', 'these additions have better informed the public about participants views on both the longrun objectives of policy and the path of interest rates most consistent with achieving those objectives', 'the statement established for the first time an explicit longerrun goal for inflation of  percent and it pointed to the sep to provide information about committee participants assessments of the longerrun normal unemployment rate currently between . and  percent', 'the statement also indicated that the committee would take a balanced approach to its price stability and employment objectives', 'the increases in policy transparency that were achieved proved valuable during a very difficult period for monetary policy', 'the immediate trigger of the crisis as you know was a sharp decline in house prices which reversed a previous runup that had been fueled by irresponsible mortgage lending and securitization practices', 'policymakers at the time including myself certainly appreciated that house prices might decline although we disagreed about how much decline was likely indeed prices were already moving down when i took office in', 'however to a significant extent our expectations about the possible macroeconomic effects of house price declines were shaped by the apparent analogy to the bursting of the dotcom bubble a few years earlier', 'it did so because unlike the earlier decline in equity prices it interacted with critical vulnerabilities in the financial system and in government regulation that allowed what were initially moderate aggregate losses to subprime mortgage holders to cascade through the financial system', 'although in principle monetary policy can be used to address financial imbalances the presumption remains that macroprudential tools together with wellfocused traditional regulation and supervision should serve as the first line of defense against emerging threats to financial stability', 'however more remains to be done to better understand how to design and implement more effective macroprudential tools and how these tools interact with monetary policy', 'monetary policy while liquidity provision and other emergency steps were critical to stemming the financial panic a rapid shift in the stance of monetary policy was necessary to counteract the massive economic blow delivered by the crisis', 'to provide additional monetary policy accommodation despite the constraint imposed by the effective lower bound on interest rates the federal reserve turned to two alternative tools enhanced forward guidance regarding the likely path of the federal funds rate and largescale purchases of longerterm securities for the federal reserves portfolio', 'for example the bank of england and the bank of japan have employed detailed forward guidance and conducted largescale asset purchases while the european central bank has moved to reduce the perceived risk of sovereign debt provided banks with substantial liquidity and offered qualitative guidance regarding the future path of interest rates', 'with shortterm rates near zero expanded guidance about intentions for future policy has helped to shape market expectations which in turn has eased financial conditions by putting downward pressure on longerterm interest rates and helped support economic activity', 'forward guidance about the shortterm interest rate supplements the broader policy framework i described earlier

about the costs and efficacy of the available policy tools', 'in december  the committee introduced statecontingent guidance announcing for the first time that no increase in the federal funds rate target should be anticipated so long as unemployment remained above  percent inflation between one and two years ahead was projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the committees  percent longerrun goal and longerterm inflation expectations continued to be well anchored', 'largescale asset purchases also provide monetary accommodation by lowering longterm interest rates', 'in particular the fomcs decision to modestly reduce the pace of asset purchases at its december meeting did not indicate any diminution of its commitment to maintain a highly accommodative monetary policy for as long as needed rather it reflected the progress we have made toward our goal of substantial improvement in the labor market outlook that we set out when we began the current purchase program in september', 'at its most recent meeting the committee reaffirmed and clarified its guidance on rates stating that it expects to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate well past the time that the unemployment threshold of  percent is crossed especially if projected inflation continues to run below the committees  percent longerrun goal', 'skeptics have pointed out that the pace of recovery has been disappointingly slow with inflationadjusted gdp growth averaging only slightly higher than a  percent annual rate over the past few years and inflation below the committees  percent longerterm target', 'however as i will discuss the recovery has faced powerful headwinds suggesting that economic growth might well have been considerably weaker or even negative without substantial monetary policy support', 'for example changes in guidance appear to shift interest rate expectations and the preponderance of studies show that asset purchases push down longerterm interest rates and boost asset prices', 'under the operating procedures used prior to the crisis the presence of large quantities of excess reserves likely would have impeded the fomcs ability to raise shortterm nominal interest rates when appropriate', 'the interest rate on excess reserves can be raised which will put upward pressure on shortterm rates in addition the federal reserve will be able to employ other tools such as fixedrate overnight reverse repurchase agreements term deposits or term repurchase agreements to drain bank reserves and tighten its control over money market rates if this proves necessary', 'as a result at the appropriate time the fomc will be able to return to conducting monetary policy primarily through adjustments in the shortterm policy rate', 'it is possible however that some specific aspects of the federal reserves operating framework will change the committee will be considering this question in the future taking into account what it learned from its experience with an expanded balance sheet and new tools for managing interest rates', 'payroll employment has risen by  million jobs from its trough', 'the unemployment rate has fallen from  percent in the fall of  to  percent recently', 'when the economy was in free fall in late  and early  such improvement was far from certain as indicated at the time by stock prices that were nearly  percent below current levels and very wide credit spreads', 'at  percent the unemployment rate still is elevated', 'the number of longterm unemployed remains unusually high and other measures of labor underutilization such as the number of people who are working part time for economic reasons have improved less than the unemployment rate', 'as carmen reinhart and ken rogoff noted in their prescient research economic activity following financial crises tends to be anemic especially when the preceding economic expansion was accompanied by rapid growth in credit and real estate prices', 'although the federal reserve like other forecasters has tended to be overoptimistic in its forecasts of real gdp during this recovery we have also at times been too pessimistic in our forecasts of the unemployment rate', 'for example over the past year unemployment has declined notably more quickly than we or other forecasters expected even as gdp growth was moderately lower than expected a year ago', 'this discrepancy reflects a number of factors including declines in participation but an important reason is the slow growth of productivity during this recovery intuitively when productivity gains are limited firms need more workers even if demand is growing slowly', 'disappointing productivity growth accordingly must be added to the list of reasons that economic growth has been slower than hoped', 'incidentally the slow pace of productivity gains early in the recovery was not evident until well after the fact because of large data revisionsan illustration of the frustrations of realtime policymaking', 'the reasons for weak productivity growth are not entirely clear it may be a result of the severity of the financial crisis for example if tight credit conditions have inhibited innovation productivityimproving investments and the formation of new firms or it may simply reflect slow growth in sales which have led firms to use capital and labor less intensively or even mismeasurement', 'notably productivity growth has also flagged in a number of foreign economies that were hardhit by the financial crisis', 'yet another possibility is weak productivity growth reflects longerterm trends largely unrelated to the recession', 'obviously the resolution of the productivity puzzle will be important in shaping our expectations for longerterm growth', 'to this list of reasons for the slow recoverythe effects of the financial crisis problems in the housing and mortgage markets weakerthanexpected productivity growth and events in europe and elsewherei would add one more significant factornamely fiscal policy', 'since that time however federal fiscal policy has turned quite restrictive according to the congressional budget office tax increases and spending cuts likely lowered output growth in  by as much as  percentage points', 'to illustrate the extent of fiscal tightness at the current point in the recovery from the  recession employment at all levels of government had increased by nearly  workers in contrast in the current recovery government employment has declined by more than  jobs a net difference of more than . million jobs', 'most importantly with fiscal and monetary policy working in opposite directions the recovery is weaker than it otherwise would be', 'but the current policy mix is particularly problematic when interest rates are very low as is the case today', 'monetary policy has less room to maneuver when interest rates are close to zero while expansionary fiscal policy is likely both more effective and less costly in terms of increased debt burden when interest rates are pinned at low levels', 'a more balanced policy mix might also avoid some of the costs of very low interest rates such as potential risks to financial stability without sacrificing jobs and growth', 'nearterm fiscal policy at the federal level remains restrictive but the degree of restraint on economic growth seems likely to lessen somewhat in  and even more so in  meanwhile the budgetary situations of state and local governments have improved reducing the need for further sharp cuts', 'for example notwithstanding the effects of somewhat higher mortgage rates house prices have rebounded with one consequence being that the number of homeowners with underwater mortgages has dropped significantly as have foreclosures and mortgage delinquencies', 'the combination of financial healing greater balance in the housing market less fiscal restraint and of course continued monetary policy accommodation bodes well for u.s. economic growth in coming quarters', 'although difficult reformssuch as banking and fiscal reform in europe and structural reform in japanare still in early stages we have also seen indications of better growth in the advanced economies which should have positive implications for the united states', 'although growth prospects for the emerging markets continue to be good here too the extent and effectiveness of structural reforms like those currently under way in china and mexico will be critical factors', 'the experience has led to important changes at our

pursue two goals maximum employment and stable prices', 'together we commonly refer to these objectives as our dual mandate and pursuing both at the same time means that we seek the maximum level of employment that is consistent with price stability', 'regarding the pricestability goal our framework references an annual inflation rate of  percent as most consistent with our pricestability goal

yield at the end of the growing season', 'inherent in this outlook is considerable uncertainty and a farmer has to be able to manage the risks and possible costs of being wrong in one way or another about prices', 'now let me tell you a bit about how i approach our monetary policy decisions', 'with this in mind i recently restarted the fed listens process at the board in which we focus not on monetary policy and hear from a range of different people about how the economy is affecting them', 'as the member of the board of governors with experience in community banking i often speak to local bankers who are excellent sources to understand the important effects of monetary policy decisions on main street', 'it is concerning to see that south dakotas tribal communities particularly those on rural reservations are experiencing a slower employment recovery than in other parts of the country', 'as much as any other preparation for fomc meetings all of these conversations are vital inputs

factors that i believe could pose a risk to continued progress toward our maximumemployment and inflation goals', 'first looking at the job market stringent economic and social distancing restrictions imposed in an effort to contain the spread of the virus resulted in enormous job losses in the early months of the pandemic with the unemployment rate surging from . percent in february  a year low to . percent in april', 'since the middle of last year however as the economy started to reopen we have seen steady progress toward maximum employment', 'that progress continued in september with the

unfilled job openings remain exceptionally strong', 'on balance i anticipate that employment will continue to move up in the months ahead although for several reasons that are unrelated to the stance of monetary policy i dont expect that we will see employment fully return to prepandemic levels any time soon', 'first despite all of the economic progress it is clear that switching off economic activity for such a long period has had lasting consequences and expectations of a smooth resumption of production transportation and business operations may not be met for some time', 'in addition many older workers dislocated by the pandemic effectively retired and probably will not rejoin the workforce even in a much stronger job market', 'while i would not want to place too much weight on one or two months of data the most recent reports on employment and anecdotal reports from a wide range of businesses suggest that even when offering higher wages and signing bonuses many employers are finding it difficult to fill open positions', 'history tells us that the longer workers remain out of the workforce the less likely it is that they will return to employment and the greater the likelihood that they will lose skills and connections with the job market which could weigh on labor force participation for years to come', 'the federal reserves policy tools are useful for promoting a strong job market but they are not well suited to addressing these harmful effects on labor supply', 'another reason for my cautious outlook for employment growth is that while large firms have adequate resources funding options and flexibility to withstand pandemicrelated disruptions many small businesses without those advantages have closed permanently', 'let me turn now to our other monetary policy goal price stability', 'earlier this year as the economy was reopening we saw a pronounced pickup in inflation as prices for motor vehicles electronics and other goods rose especially

semiconductors in motor vehicles appliances and other goods', 'we are seeing shipments at record levels and more capacity is expected to come on line but the combination of strong demand and intermittent disruptions to this complex supply chain poses a risk that it could be some time before semiconductor supply issues are resolved', 'as a consequence the shortage of automotive chips has considerably reduced the number of new cars completed in the manufacturing process driving up prices for those that have been produced', 'the lack of new cars for sale on dealer lots has also boosted demand and prices this year for used cars and spilled over to the rental car market leading to soaring car rental prices', 'fortunately these prices eased a bit in september but they are still elevated and this causes spillovers in the broader economy as well', 'as the various supply bottlenecks we are currently seeing are gradually resolved we should see monthly inflation readings step down further from the high rates we have observed this year', 'another source of inflation risk comes from the lower labor force participation which as i mentioned earlier has led some firms to offer inducements to bring potential workers back including hiring bonuses and higher wages', 'wage increases and these additional employee investments are increasing firms costs potentially adding to inflationary pressures', 'in the agricultural sector prices for most major commodities remain above prepandemic levels and farm income is expected to be higher than a year ago for the second consecutive year', 'but since farmers lock in prices for inputs before planting the effects of substantial price increases for inputs like fuel and fertilizer have not yet been fully realized', 'in their planning for next seasons planting farmers are much more concerned about input cost inflation', 'in addition if they can even find equipment or land to buy prices for these assets have continued to increase', 'another source of inflationary pressure is the rapid increase in house prices something that also raises potential concerns about valuation pressures', 'the ongoing strength in housing demand is also notably driving up rental costs', 'higher house prices also make it much more difficult for lowto moderateincome households to become homeowners as larger down payments and other financing requirements in effect lock these households out of the housing market', 'amid the booming real estate market some bankers i spoke with recently cited concerns about a possible house price bubble and growing concerns about potential risks to financial stability', 'but homes are a widely held asset and even a modest shift in the housing market especially a decline in home prices could have significant ripple effects throughout the economy', 'if elevated inflation readings continue into and through the next year we may begin to see an imprint on longerrun inflation expectations',

levels in the s and early s in more recent decades inflation has run close to our  percent goal helping anchor the publics inflation expectations at levels that seem consistent with our goal', 'this

monetary policy more broadly and the fomcs most recent decision at our meeting in september', 'when actions taken to mitigate the spread of covid began to disrupt the u.s. economy and financial markets in the first half of last year the fomc cut shortterm interest rates to near zero and began purchasing treasury securities and agency mortgagebacked securities', 'by the middle of last year we were seeing signs of resilience in economic activity with labor market conditions beginning to recover from the economic effects of the pandemic', 'in december we indicated that we would start scaling back our asset purchases after the u.s. economy had made substantial further progress toward our maximumemployment and pricestability goals', 'in particular i am concerned that our asset purchases could now be contributing to valuation pressures especially in housing and equity markets or that maintaining a highly accommodative monetary policy stance at this stage of the economic expansion may

strongly believe that bringing inflation back to our target is a necessary condition for meeting the goals mandated by congress of price stability and maximum employment on a sustainable basis', 'at this point for me it comes down to what the incoming data and other economic information will tell us about the outlook for inflation', 'if we do not see signs that inflation is moving down my view continues to be that sizable increases in the target range for the federal funds rate should remain on the table', 'however if inflation starts to decline i believe a slower pace of rate increases would be appropriate', 'to bring inflation down in a consistent and lasting way the federal funds rate will need to move up to a restrictive level and remain there for some time', 'however it is not yet clear how high we will need to raise the federal funds rate and how much time will pass before we begin to see inflation moving back down in a consistent and lasting way', 'my general point is that inflation is much too high and the outlook for inflation remains significantly uncertain', 'with this in mind i will turn to the main topic id like to discuss today which is the potential role that explicit forward guidance can play as a monetary policy tool', 'forward guidance is official fomc communication that is intended to signal to the public the likely future path of monetary policy', 'the intent of all forward guidance is to influence the publics expectations about the fomcs future monetary policy actions and in doing so affect longerterm interest rates and broader financial conditions to help support a path for inflation and economic activity that would be consistent with accomplishing t the committees pricestability and maximumemployment goals', 'as you know over the past  years or so the federal reserve has increased the transparency and the frequency of its communications with the public including through more frequent use of forward guidance in describing its monetary policy decisions', 'let me stress here that i view clear and transparent communication with the public from the federal reserve as crucial to enable a better understanding of and to reinforce the effectiveness of our monetary policy actions all of which help keep us accountable to the public', 'over about the past  years the use of explicit forward guidance has become an integral part of the federal reserves monetary policy toolkit', 'in fact explicit forward guidance is generally seen by many as especially helpful when use of the committees main monetary policy tool changes to the federal funds rate is constrained', 'explicit forward guidance hasnt always been viewed as a helpful addition to the monetary policy toolkit particularly before the  financial crisis', 'a related worry was that if the committee were too slow to alter its forward guidanceperhaps because it feared an outsized market reaction or a loss of credibilitymonetary policy could be more likely to fall behind the curve', 'in this regard one cost of providing explicit forward guidance would be a loss of the flexibility needed to respond to changes in economic conditions as required by the pursuit of our pricestability and maximumemployment goals', 'on the whole there was a consensus before the turn of the century that costbenefit considerations did not favor the use of explicit forward guidance as a monetary policy tool', 'this could be accomplished in two waysfirst through simple changes in the federal funds rate and second relying on the public to infer any future moves in the policy rate based on their own assessments of the fomcs likely policy reactions to developments in inflation and economic activity', 'over time federal reserve officials began to more seriously consider the possible benefits that forward guidance could provide to the effectiveness of the fomcs monetary policy decisions by influencing longerterm interest rates in a way that aided the committees achievement of its statutory price stability and maximumemployment goals', 'and beginning in  in addition to describing the current policy decision the postmeeting statement contained a paragraph on the balance of risks that was meant to indicate how the committee assesses the risks of heightened inflation pressures or economic weakness in the foreseeable future', 'evidence suggests that the shift toward more transparent communication by the fomc in the early s including its use of forward guidance allowed financial market participants to better anticipate changes in the stance of monetary policy which were then reflected in broader financial conditions', 'explicit forward guidance and largescale asset purchases quickly emerged as the two main new tools of monetary policy', 'in a way explicit forward guidance was seen as providing monetary policy accommodation when the current setting of the federal funds rate could not', 'by providing guidance on specific outcomes that would need to be achieved before the fomc would consider raising the target range for the federal funds rate the committee could help reduce uncertainty regarding its future policy decisions and keep longerterm interest rates low as the economic recovery progressed', 'in addition with the risks to the outlook generally seen as tilted to the downside in the years that followed the financial crisis using explicit forward guidance to signal a low for longer policy was not seen as posing significant risks to the committees credibility because shortterm interest rates were generally expected to remain unusually low during those years', 'in addition the outcomebased forward guidance employed by the fomc in the years following the financial crisis explicitly recognized the possibility that inflationary pressures could emerge', 'it incorporated a version of an escape clause in its forward guidance that would prompt a reconsideration of the policy stance should such inflationary pressures emerge', 'in particular in its december  statement the committee noted that it expected the target range for the federal funds rate to remain at  to  percent for at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above  percent inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the committees  percent longerrun goal and longerterm inflation expectations continue to be well anchored', 'i will focus here on two features of our current environment that i see as especially relevant for assessing the role of explicit forward guidance as a monetary policy tool in the current conduct of monetary policy', 'the first is that with inflation unacceptably high and the resulting urgent need to remove monetary policy accommodation the federal funds rate is no longer near zero', 'the committee can now indicate its intended stance of monetary policy through changes to the target range for the federal funds rateits stated primary tool of monetary policyrather than relying on more unconventional monetary policy tools such as forward guidance and balance sheet policy to serve as the main indicators of the stance of monetary policy', 'the second is that the outlook for inflation and economic activity is especially uncertain with significant twosided risks', 'gone are the days when the risks to the outlook were skewed to the downside especially with respect to inflation', 'and twosided risks to economic activity are also widely recognized by the public with press reports of an overheating labor market often featured alongside discussions of high or rising recession risks', 'given that the federal funds rate is now well above zero the fomc can communicate changes in the stance of monetary policy through changes in the target range for the federal funds rate and not rely on explicit forward guidance as it did when the federal funds rate was at the effective lower bound', 'after all back then the economy was still weighed down by the aftereffects of the  financial crisis and inflation was running persistently below our  percent target', 'looking back one might reasonably argue that during that time the committees explicit forward guidance for both the federal funds rate and asset purchases contributed to a situation where the stance of monetary policy remained too accommodative for too longeven as inflation was rising and showing signs of becoming more broadbased than previously thought', 'as late as november  our forward guidance still indicated that the committee intended to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at  to  percent until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the committees assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to  percent and is on track to moderately exceed  percent for some time', 'with the benefit of hindsight one might ask whether we would have moved sooner to remove monetary policy accommodation if we hadnt been so explicit about our forward guidance in prior monthsparticularly forward guidance that had set such a high bar for slowing our asset purchases and starting to raise rates', 'of course the fact that some of the data that were directly relevant to our decisionmaking did not accurately reflect the economic conditions prevailing at the timeand which were subsequently revisedlikely also led to a delay in the removal of monetary policy accommodation in', 'more generally i will note that high uncertainty and twosided risks to the outlook raise some practical questions for the use of explicit forward guidance in the current monetary policy environment', 'it should be used during periods when the committee cannot adjust the federal funds rate any lower due to the effective lower bound and when the committee also has reasonable confidence that that the federal funds rate will need to remain near zero for a period of time to stimulate growth and when inflationary pressures are expected to be subdued', 'even in such periods the committee should recognize possible risks to a lowforlong monetary policy stance including upside risks to inflation and provide escape clauses that would detail the circumstances that would cause the committee to reevaluate its policy stance', 'outside of such periods our focus should be on changes in the target range for the federal funds ratethe committees primary tool for implementing monetary policy decisionsin communicating the stance of monetary policy and in providing more qualitative guidance regarding how the committee will be thinking about its future policy decisions', 'in the first half of this year when the committee began to signal that it would increase the target range for the federal funds rate and that it anticipated that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate longerterm interest rates rose and financial conditions tightened', 'before i conclude i will emphasize again that my reservations about explicit forward guidance notwithstanding i am a strong believer in the role of communication in the conduct of monetary policy', 'clear and transparent communications with the public reinforce the effectiveness of our monetary policy and keep us accountable to the public', 'under current circumstances however the best we can do on the public communications front is first to continue to stress our unwavering resolve to do what is needed to restore price stability', 'second as chair powell noted recently we should acknowledge that the outlook for inflation and economic activity is subject to

primary concerns of the fomc was that inflation had consistently been running slightly below the committees  percent inflation target despite years of accommodative monetary policy following the  financial crisis and subsequent recession', 'more broadly many central banks around the world were grappling with the prospect of structurally lower interest rates due to a variety of factors including demographic changes and higher savings rates lower potential output and productivity growth and greater investor demand for safe assets like treasury securities', 'one central topic of discussion during fomc meetings in  and  my first year as a governor and permanent voting member of the fomc was how monetary policy strategies and tools could best achieve the committees dual mandate

policy it had the benefit of a strong labor market a steadily expanding economy and inflation near  percent', 'the fomc maintained this range until the second half of  when the committee reduced the

whether further supplyside improvements will continue to lower inflation', 'and while these investments have the potential to increase productive capacity over the next few years they may also create strong demand for labor and equipment in areas without the necessary physical resources to support the development which may increase inflationary pressures', 'in my view there is also a risk that over the coming months higher energy prices could reverse some of the recent progress made by supplyside improvements to bring overall inflation down', 'second over the past year the number of workers in the labor force has increased from improved labor force participation and other factors including recent growth in work visa issuance for some immigrants', 'at the same time the average pace of job

productivity of the american workforce in coming years', 'over time american workers who experienced these education disruptions may overcome the pandemicera learning losses but today as young people leave education and transition into the work force there is a risk that either the economy will experience lower longterm trend growth or that the divide between those who suffered learning losses and those who did not results in vastly different economic and overall outcomes for this generation of american workers', 'the third of these uncertainties is the extent to which strong aggregate demand and the composition of spending will continue and contribute to inflationary pressures going forward', 'if goods consumption continues to be a greater proportion of overall consumption the expected deflationary effect from goods prices could be delayed', 'there is also a risk to inflation from higher services consumption', 'with too few workers to fill the number of existing job openings a continued increase in the demand for services may contribute to persistently high core services inflation', 'additionally a lack of fiscal restraint could further contribute to inflationary

roughly  percent of respondents have already pulled back on investment requiring financing at current interest rates', 'however another  percent say that they are not interest rate sensitive their financing or borrowing is not influenced by rates or they do not know the level at which the rate would become an impediment', 'finally given all of the considerations i have just discussed it is not yet clear whether the appropriate level of the federal funds rate will need to remain at a higher level than before the pandemic in order to effectively foster low and stable inflation and support full employment', 'in my view given potential structural changes in the economy such as higher demand for investment relative to saving it is quite possible that the level of the federal funds rate

monetary policy amid a wide range of uncertainties and risks an omnipresent challenge monetary policymakers face is how to account for uncertainties surrounding the current state of the economy and the economic outlook when setting monetary policy', 'macroeconomic models that can help guide the setting of monetary policy often invoke unobservable concepts such as the natural rate of unemployment potential output or the neutral real interest rate', 'despite these challenges monetary policymaking requires a forwardlooking approach since its actions affect the economy labor markets and inflation with a lag', 'the postfinancial crisis economy and monetary policy at the zero lower bound when i joined the fomc in late  despite nearly a decade of accommodative monetary policy following the financial crisis and subsequent recession one of the primary concerns was that inflation had persistently been running slightly below the committees  percent inflation target', 'there was a recognition that the natural rate of unemployment may have been lower than many on the fomc had estimated and that inflation may have become less responsive to reductions in the unemployment rate', 'this recognition meant that preemptive increases in the federal funds rate based on expected reductions in the unemployment rate alone may not have been needed to keep inflation and inflation expectations aligned with the committees  percent target', 'a central topic of fomc meeting discussions throughout  was how monetary policy strategies and tools could best achieve the committees dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment when structurally low interest rates and disinflationary forces kept inflation persistently under the committees inflation target', 'and that this proximity could limit the committees ability to respond effectively to an adverse shock by using our primary monetary policy tool of lowering the target range for the federal funds rate', 'more broadly many central banks around the world were grappling with the prospect of structurally lower interest rates due to a variety of factors including demographic changes and higher savings rates

inflation from its longerrun goal', 'by replacing the word deviations with shortfalls when describing employment and the committees reaction to changes in employment relative to estimates of its maximum level the committee indicated that it would not act preemptively to curb inflation based only on the perception of labor market tightness', 'another notable change to the strategy statement was the adoption of what some refer to as asymmetric flexible average inflation targeting or temporary price level targeting', 'specifically the new statement noted that in order to anchor longerterm inflation expectations at its  percent goal the committee seeks to achieve inflation that averages  percent over time and therefore judges that following periods when inflation has been running persistently below  percent appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above  percent for some time', 'the revisions to the fomcs statement focused on monetary policy

commitment to the committees inflation target it did not describe how the committee would respond if inflation were to run persistently above its  percent goal', 'this shockcombined with the policy

response toward the latter part of the fomcs monetary policy framework review in march  the covid pandemic created an unprecedented shock to the global economy and financial system', 'widespread

that the target range would remain at  to  percent until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the committees assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to  percent and is on track to moderately exceed  percent for some time', 'in its december  postmeeting statement the fomc added forward guidance regarding its asset purchases by noting that it expected that the current pace of asset purchases would continue until substantial further progress has been made toward the committees maximum employment and price stability goals', 'this explicit

the committee needed to move toward a tighter policy stance', 'it seems likely to me that the experience of the years leading up to the pandemic when inflation was persistently low made it hard for many to foresee how quickly that situation could change', 'of course the inflation and labor data did not accurately reflect the economic conditions prevailing at the time and were subsequently

promote market functioning and the effective transmission of monetary policy but limit the federal reserves overall footprint in financial markets in the longer term', 'this experience also highlights the importance of clearly distinguishing monetary policy actions from temporary central bank asset purchase programs used to promote core financial market functioning like those created to support

monetary policy rules', 'this type of analysis can provide helpful input in informing my own views on the appropriate path of monetary policy', 'given the importance of transparency it is also necessary that our communications explain not only how the economic outlook affects our monetary policy decisions often referred to as the fomcs reaction function but also how the risks and uncertainties surrounding the economic outlook matter for those decisions', 'with that in mind i will conclude my remarks with my own views on the nearterm economic outlook including some prominent risks and uncertainties and the implications for monetary policy', 'at its current setting our monetary policy stance is restrictive and appears to be appropriately calibrated to reduce inflationary pressures', 'we have seen significant progress on lowering inflation over the past year while economic activity and the labor market have remained strong', 'consumer services spending has shown continued strength through february and payroll employment increased at a very strong pace in the first quarter', 'however most employment gains over the past year have been in parttime employment and some of the recent strength in job gains may reflect stronger labor supply due to increased immigration', 'the month readings of total and core pce inflation through february printed at . and . percent respectively much lower than a year ago', 'however with the annualized month pce inflation readings moving wellabove the month measures in february i expect further progress in bringing inflation down to  percent will be slower this year', 'still my baseline outlook continues to be that inflation will decline further with the policy rate held steady at its current level and that the labor market will remain strong but with labor demand and supply gradually rebalancing as the number of job openings relative to unemployed workers declines', 'and should the incoming data continue to indicate that inflation is moving sustainably toward our  percent goal it will eventually become appropriate to gradually lower the federal funds rate to prevent monetary policy from becoming overly restrictive', 'however we are still not yet at the point where it is appropriate to lower the policy rate and i continue to see a number of upside risks to inflation', 'first much of the progress on inflation last year was due to supplyside improvements including easing of supply chain constraints increases in the number of available workers due in part to immigration and lower energy prices', 'it is unclear whether further supplyside improvements will continue to lower inflation', 'for example the rebound in labor productivity last year may have reflected an unwinding of temporary pandemicrelated labor market dynamics such as a slowing in the high levels of employee turnover during that time', 'therefore if wage gains remain elevated going forward these effects may no longer contribute to lower price inflation in the future', 'geopolitical developments could also pose upside risks to inflation including the risk of spillovers from geopolitical conflicts and the extent to which food and energy markets and supply chains remain exposed to these influences', 'another upside inflation risk i see is from additional fiscal stimulus or a higher spendout rate from existing and new appropriations', 'although some of the recent policies may increase productive capacity in the medium term they may add to inflationary pressures by boosting aggregate demand', 'i also see upside risks to housing services inflation', 'there is also a risk that continued labor market tightness and continued strong services demand could lead to persistently higher core services inflation', 'inflation readings over the past two months suggest progress may be uneven or slower going forward especially for core services', 'finally there is uncertainty regarding whether the federal funds rate will need to remain at a higher level than before the pandemic in order to effectively foster low and stable inflation and support full employment', 'in my view given potential structural changes in the economy like higher investment demand relative to available savings it is quite possible that the level of the federal funds rate consistent with low and stable inflation will be higher than before the pandemic', 'if that is the case fewer rate cuts will eventually be appropriate to return our monetary policy stance to a neutral level', 'while it is not my baseline outlook i continue to see the risk that at a future meeting we may need to increase the policy rate further should progress on inflation stall or even reverse', 'given the risks and uncertainties regarding my economic outlook i will continue to watch the data closely as i assess the appropriate path of monetary policy and i will remain cautious in my approach to considering future changes in the stance of policy', 'reducing our policy rate too soon or too quickly could result in a rebound in inflation requiring further future policy rate increases to return inflation to  percent over the longer run', 'closing thoughts to conclude the experience over the past five years highlights the enduring challenge of setting forwardlooking monetary policy amid a wide and evolving range of risks and uncertainties', 'taking into account this experience and the lessons i have learned over my tenure on the fomc an important question i will be considering is how to make monetary policy strategy and its related communications durable to a wide range of possible shocks and changes in the macroeconomy', 'while the future is full of risks and uncertainties the fomcs mandate of fostering price stability and

today than those that dominated the canon of u.s. monetary policymaking over the previous halfcentury which i refer to as the new normal', 'a key feature of the new normal is that the neutral interest ratethe level of the federal funds rate that is consistent with the economy growing close to its potential rate full employment and stable inflationappears to be much lower than it was in the decades prior to the crisis', 'in the federal open market committees fomc most recent summary of economic projections sep the median fomc participant expected a longerrun real federal funds rate after subtracting inflation of  percent down sharply from the value the first time the policy projection was published in the january  sep of  percentand the average value in the decades prior to the financial crisis of  percent', 'the low level of the neutral rate limits the amount of space available for cutting the federal funds rate to offset adverse developments and thereby can be expected to increase the frequency and duration of periods when the policy rate is constrained by the effective lower bound unemployment is elevated and inflation is below target', 'in this environment frequent or extended periods of low inflation run the risk of pulling down privatesector inflation expectations which could amplify the degree and persistence of shortfalls of inflation thereby making future lower bound episodes even more challenging in terms of output and employment losses', 'to the extent it is weighing on longerrun inflation expectations the persistently low level of the neutral federal funds rate may be a factor contributing to the persistent shortfall of u.s. inflation from the fomcs target', 'further complicating the ability of central banks to achieve their inflation objectives in todays new normal is the very flat phillips curve observed in the united states and many other advanced economies which makes the relationship between labor market conditions and price inflation more tenuous', 'for instance inflation has remained stubbornly below the fomcs  percent target for the past five years even as unemployment has fallen from . percent to . percent a level that most experts believe is in the vicinity of full employment', 'reflecting on the feds available policy toolbox bernanke concludes that the available tools are not likely to be sufficient and proposes a framework that relies on forward guidance with commitment to help central banks achieve their inflation and employment objectives', 'the makeup principle the academic literature on monetary policy suggests a variety of prescriptions for preventing a lower neutral rate of interest from eroding longerrun inflation expectations', 'for instance raising the inflation target sufficiently to provide meaningfully greater policy space could engender public discomfort or at the other extreme risk unmooring inflation expectations', 'as i have noted previously the persistence of the shortfall in inflation from our objective is an important consideration for monetary policy', 'the makeup principle in which policy would make up for past misses of the inflation target is not reflected in most standard monetary policy frameworks although it is an important precept in theory', 'for example while pricelevel targeting would be helpful in the aftermath of a recession that puts the economy at the effective lower bound it could require tightening into a negative supply shock which is a very unattractive feature as bernanke points out', 'bernanke proposes a framework that avoids this undesirable possibility by implementing a temporary pricelevel targeting framework only in periods where conventional policy is constrained by the lower bound', 'bernankes proposal thus has the advantage of maintaining standard practice in normal times while proposing a makeup policy in periods when the policy rate is limited by the lower bound and inflation is below target', 'his proposed temporary pricelevel target would delay the liftoff of the policy rate from the lower bound until the average inflation over the entire lower bound episode has reached  percent and full employment is achieved', 'this type of policy which would result in temporary overshooting of the inflation target in order to make up for the previous period of undershooting is designed to in bernankes words calibrate the vigor of the policy response...to the severity of the episode', 'the normalization bias the proposed temporary pricelevel targeting policy is designed to address what i see as one of the key challenges facing policymakers', 'this was apparent in  for instance when there was substantial pressure among group of twenty officials to commit to timelines and targets for reducing fiscal support and to articulate exit principles for monetary policy', 'for example the factors underlying what we now understand to be the new normal of persistently low interest rates were in many cases initially viewed as temporary headwinds', 'in these circumstances a standard policy framework calibrated around the precrisis or old normal may be biased to underachieving the inflation target in a low neutral rate environment', 'the kind of policy framework that bernanke proposes which precommits to implementing the makeup principle based on the actual observed performance of inflation during a lower bound episode could guard against premature liftoff and help prevent the erosion of longerterm inflation expectations', 'monetary policymakers operate in an environment of considerable uncertainty and therefore have to weigh the risks of tightening too little or too late against those of tightening too much or too soon', 'while past experience has conditioned u.s. policymakers to be highly attentive to the risks associated with a breakout of inflation to the upside as in the s they balance these risks against those associated with undershooting the inflation target persistently as in japan in the late s and the s', 'in weighing these risks the standard approach is typically designed to achieve convergence from below in which inflation gradually rises to its target', 'given the lags in the effects of monetary policy convergence from below would necessitate raising interest rates preemptively well in advance of inflation reaching its target', 'while a standard policy framework would tend to prescribe that tightening should start preemptively well before inflation reaches target bernankes temporary pricelevel target proposal would imply maintaining the policy rate at the lower bound well past the point at which inflation has risen above target', 'in principle policymakers would have to be willing to accept elevated rates of abovetarget inflation for a period following a lengthy period of undershooting', 'just as policymakers could run a risk of low inflation becoming entrenched in the standard preemptive framework so too there are risks in the temporary pricelevel target framework', 'one risk is that the public seeing elevated rates of inflation may start to doubt that the central bank is still serious about its inflation target', 'it is worth noting that the policy is motivated by the opposite concernthat convergence from below following an extended lower bound episode may lead to an unanchoring of inflation expectations to the downside', 'still a conscious policy of overshooting may be difficult to calibrate especially since the large confidence intervals around inflation forecasts suggest that the risks of an undesired overshooting are nontrivial', 'a related risk is that the central bank would lose its nerve maintaining the interest rate at zero in the face of a strong economy and inflation notably above its target would place a central bank in uncomfortable territory', 'one additional challenge of the proposed framework is specifying a path for the policy rate immediately following liftoff that smoothly and gradually eases inflation back down to target and facilitates a gradual adjustment of the labor market', 'in the proposed framework once the cumulative average rate of inflation during the lowerbound period has reached the target of  percent policy would revert to a standard policy rule', 'this implies that a standard policy rule would kick in at a point when inflation is above target and the economy is at or beyond full employment', 'integrating the policy rate and the balance sheet the temporary pricelevel targeting framework proposed by bernanke is appealing on a conceptual level because it proposes a simple and clear mechanism to help policymakers deal with the challenges posed by the lower bound on the policy rate in an environment of uncertainty', 'today when many central banks in advanced economies are operating with two distinct tools policymakers consider the effects of the balance sheet as well as the policy rate in their assessment of the extent of accommodation provided by monetary policy', 'as bernanke acknowledges now that many central banks have developed playbooks specifying the operational modalities associated with asset purchases and there is some familiarity with their effects on asset prices and financial conditions there is a greater likelihood that asset purchases would become a part of the policy reaction function along with forward guidance during lowerbound episodes', 'it appears the public closely follows statements about both the policy rate and asset purchases to glean possible information about the future overall stance of monetary policy', 'the new normal appears to be characterized by low neutral rates and a weak relationship between overall inflation and unemployment not only in the united states but also in many other advanced economies with lowerbound episodes likely to be more prevalent', 'in this kind of environment it is conceivable the kind of committed forward guidance associated with the temporary pricelevel targeting framework proposed by bernanke by helping rule out anticipation of a standard preemptive tightening could help avoid unwarranted premature tightening through the exchange rate', 'moreover news about policy rates and term premiums appears to have quite different effects on exchange rates such that the ordering of policy normalization can have important implications for exchange rates and associated financial conditions as i discussed earlier this year', 'recent staff estimates suggest that news about expected changes in the policy rate tends to have a large spillover through the exchange rate whereas news about changes in term premiums tends to lead to corresponding crossborder changes in term premiums as discussed previously with much smaller effects on the exchange rate', 'moreover the exchange rate effect of changes in shortterm rates is much greater than it was precrisis', 'for instance policy news that leads to a  basis point increase in the expected interest rate portion of the year treasury yield is associated with a roughly  percentage point appreciation in the dollar which is three times greater than the response precrisis', 'by contrast policy news surrounding a change in u.s. term premiums has a muted effect on the exchange rate both now and precrisis', 'financial imbalances finally a low neutral rate environment may also be associated with a heightened risk of asset price bubbles which could exacerbate the tradeoff for monetary policy between achieving the traditional dualmandate goals and preventing the kinds of imbalances that could contribute to financial instability', 'standard assetvaluation models suggest that a persistently low neutral rate depending on the factors driving it could lead to higher ratios of asset prices to underlying income flowsfor example higher ratios of prices to earnings for stocks or higher prices of buildings relative to rents', 'however to the extent that financial markets extrapolate price movements markets may not transition smoothly to asset valuations that reflect underlying fundamentals but may instead evidence periods of overshooting', 'such forces may have played a role in both the stock market boom that ended in the bust of  and the house price bubble that burst in', 'the risks of such financial imbalances may be greater in the context of the kind of explicit inflation target overshooting policies proposed in the paper', 'but the combination of low interest rates and low unemployment that would prevail during the inflation overshooting period could well spark capital markets to overextend leading to financial imbalances', 'macroprudential tools are the preferred first line of defense to address such financial imbalances which should in principle enable monetary policy to focus on price stability and macroeconomic stabilization', 'although important research suggests that the situations under which monetary policy should take financial imbalances into account are likely to be very rare some recent research has pointed out that the case in favor of taking financial imbalances into account is strengthened when the consequences of financial crises are long lasting', 'in this case another complication of a persistently low neutral rate may be a sharper tradeoff between achieving the traditional dualmandate objectives and avoiding financial stability risks which may make it even more difficult to achieve our pricestability objective']"

'although it was mostly unspoken there was a growing sense at the time that a simple systematic framework for central bank practice was needed to ensure that the hardwon gains from breaking the back of inflation were not given away by shortsighted discretionary monetary experiments that were poorly executed such as had been the case in the s', 'again for this audience i will not need to remind you of the enormous impact this single paper had not only on the field of monetary economics but alsoand more importantlyon the practice of monetary policy', 'for our purposes today i will note that the crucial insight of johns paper was that whereas a central bank could pick the k in a kpercent rule on its own without any reference to the underlying parameters of the economy including r and u a welldesigned rule for setting a shortterm interest rate as a policy instrument should john argued respect several requirements', 'first the rule should anchor the nominal policy rate at a level equal to the sum of its estimate of the neutral real interest rate r and the inflation target', 'second to achieve this nominal anchor the central bank should be prepared to raise the nominal policy rate by more than oneforone when inflation exceeds target the taylor principle', 'and third the central bank should lean against the wind when outputor via an okuns law relationship the unemployment ratedeviates from its estimate of potential u', 'as woodford  demonstrates theoretically the first two requirements for a taylortype rule are necessary for it to be consistent with the objective of price stability', 'the third requirementthat monetary policy lean against the wind in response to an output or unemployment gapnot only contributes to the objective of price stability but is also obviously desirable from the perspective of a central bank like the fed that has a dual mandate', 'in original formulations of taylortype rules r was treated as constant and set equal to  percent and potential output was set equal to the congressional budget office cbo estimates of potential output or in specifications using the unemployment rate as the activity variable u was set equal to the cbos estimate of the natural unemployment rate', 'at each federal open market committee fomc meeting my colleagues and i consult potential policy rate paths implied by a number of policy rules as we assess what adjustments if any may be required for the stance of monetary policy to achieve and maintain our dualmandate objectives', 'a presentation and discussion of several of these rules has been included in the semiannual monetary policy report to the congress since july', 'i would now like to discuss how i incorporate such considerations into thinking about how to choose among monetary policy alternatives', 'a monetary policy strategy must find a way to combine incoming data and a model of the economy with a healthy dose of judgmentand humility!to formulate and then communicate a path for the policy rate most consistent with the central banks objectives', 'monetary policy should be data dependent in the sense that incoming data reveal at any point in time where the economy is relative to the ultimate objectives of price stability and maximum employment', 'this information on where the economy is relative to the goals of monetary policy is an important input into interest rate feedback rulesafter all they have to feed back on something', 'as a result in the real world monetary policy should beand in the united states i believe isdata dependent in a second sense policymakers should and do study incoming data and use models to extract signals that enable them to update and improve estimates of r and u', 'as indicated in the summary of economic projections fomc participants have over the past seven years repeatedly revised down their estimates of both u and r as unemployment fell and real interest rates remained well below prior estimates of neutral without the rise in inflation those earlier estimates would have predicted figures  and', 'in addition to u and r another important input into any monetary policy assessment is the state of inflation expectations', 'since the late s inflation expectations appear to have been stable and are often said to be well anchored', 'however inflation expectations are not directly observable they must be inferred from models other macroeconomic information market prices and surveys', 'longerterm inflation expectations that are anchored materially above or below the  percent inflation objective present a risk to price stability', 'for this reason policymakers should and do study incoming data to extract signals that can be used to update and improve estimates of expected inflation', 'in many theoretical rational expectations models expected inflation is anchored at the target level by assumption', 'financial markets and monetary policyextracting signal from noise because the true model of the economy is unknown either because the structure is unknown or because the parameters of a known structure are evolving i believe policymakers should consult a number and variety of sources of information about neutral real interest rates and expected inflation to name just two key macroeconomic variables', 'because macroeconomic models of r and longterm inflation expectations are potentially misspecified seeking out other sources of information that are not derived from the same models can be especially useful', 'to be sure financial market signals are inevitably noisy and daytoday movements in asset prices are unlikely to tell us much about the cyclical or structural position of the economy', 'interest rate futures and interest rate swaps markets provide one source of highfrequency information about the path and destination for the federal funds rate expected by market participants figure', 'interest rate option markets under certain assumptions can offer insights about the entire ex ante probability distribution of policy rate outcomes for calendar dates near or far into the future figure', 'and indeed when one reads that a future policy decision by the fed or any central bank is fully priced in this is usually based on a straight read of futures and options prices', 'but these signals from interest rate derivatives markets are only a pure measure of the expected policy rate path under the assumption of a zero risk premium', 'for this reason it is useful to compare policy rate paths derived from market prices with the path obtained from surveys of market participants which while subject to measurement error should not be contaminated with a term premium', 'but when there is a divergence between the path or destination for the policy rate implied by the surveys and a straight read of interest rate derivatives prices i place at least as much weight on the survey evidence for example derived from the surveys of primary dealers and market participants conducted by the federal reserve bank of new york as i do on the estimates obtained from market prices figure', 'but again the yield curve like the interest rate futures strip reflects not only expectations of the path of shortterm interest rates but also liquidity and term premium factors thus to extract signal about policy from noise in the yield curve a term structure model is required', 'moreover fluctuations in the term premium on u.s. treasury yields are driven in part by a significant global factor which complicates efforts to treat the slope of the yield curve as a sufficient statistic for the expected path of u.s. monetary policy clarida c', 'quotes from the treasury inflationprotected securities tips market can provide valuable information about two key inputs to monetary policy analysis longrun r and expected inflation', 'direct reads of tips spot rates and forward rates are signals of the levels of real interest rates that investors expect at various horizons and they can be used to complement modelbased estimates of r', 'in addition tips market data together with nominal treasury yields can be used to construct measures of breakeven inflation or inflation compensation that provide a noisy signal of market expectations of future inflation', 'but again a straight read of breakeven inflation needs to be augmented with a model to filter out the liquidity and risk premium components that place a wedge between inflation compensation and expected inflation', 'as is the case with the yield curve and interest rate futures it is useful to compare estimates of expected inflation derived from breakeven inflation data with estimates of expected inflation obtained from surveysfor example the expected inflation over the next  to  years from the university of michigan surveys of consumers figure', 'marketand surveybased estimates of expected inflation are correlated but again when there is a divergence between the two i place at least as much weight on the survey evidence as on the marketderived estimates', 'the examples i have mentioned illustrate the important point that in practice there is not typically a clean distinction between modelbased and marketbased inference of key economic variables such as r and expected inflation', 'the reason is that market prices reflect not only market expectations but also risk and liquidity premiums that need to be filtered out to recover the object of interestfor example expected inflation or longrun r', 'this filtering almost always requires a model of some sort so even marketbased estimates of key inputs to monetary policy are to some extent model dependent', 'implications for monetary policy let me now draw together some implications of the approach to models markets and monetary policy i have laid out in these remarks', 'macroeconomic models are of course an essential tool for monetary policy analysis but the structure of the economy evolves and the policy framework must beand i believe at the federal reserve isnimble enough to respect this evolution', 'while financial market signals can and sometimes do provide a reality check on the predictions of a model gone astray market prices are at best noisy signals of the macroeconomic variables of interest and the process of filtering out the noise itself requires a modeland good judgment', 'survey estimates of the longrun destination for key monetary policy inputs canand at the fed docomplement the predictions from macro models and market prices figure', 'the unemployment rate is at a year low real wages are rising in line with productivity inflationary pressures are muted and expected inflation is stable', 'moreover the federal funds rate is now in the range of estimates of its longerrun neutral level and the unemployment rate is not far below many estimates of u', 'so with the economy operating at or very close to the feds dualmandate objectives and with the policy rate in the range of fomc

the federal reserves monetary policy framework that my fellow policymakers and i are undertaking this year', 'we are examining the policy strategy tools and communication practices that we use to pursue our dualmandate goals of maximum employment and price stability', 'i note that central banks in other countries have conducted periodic reviews of their monetary policy frameworks and their experience has informed the approach we are pursuing', 'with the u.s. economy operating at or close to maximum employment and price stability now is an especially opportune time to conduct this review', 'the unemployment rate is near a year low and inflation is running close to our  percent objective', 'perhaps most significantly neutral interest ratesor rappear to have fallen in the united states and abroad', 'the decline in neutral policy rates likely reflects several factors including aging populations changes in risktaking behavior and a slowdown in technology growth', 'that development in turn could make it more difficult during downturns for monetary policy to support spending and employment and keep inflation from falling too low', 'another key development in recent decades is that inflation appears less responsive to resource slack', 'that is the shortrun phillips curve appears to have flattened implying a change in the dynamic relationship between inflation and employment', 'it permits the federal reserve to support employment more aggressively during downturnsas was the case during and after the great recessionbecause a sustained inflation breakout is less likely when the phillips curve is flatter', 'however a flatter phillips curve also increases the cost in terms of economic output of reversing unwelcome increases in longerrun inflation expectations', 'thus a flatter phillips curve makes it all the more important that longerrun inflation expectations remain anchored at levels consistent with our  percent inflation objective', 'finally the strengthening of the labor market in recent years has highlighted the challenges of assessing the proximity of the labor market to full employment', 'the unemployment rate which stood at . percent in may has been interpreted by many as suggesting that the labor market is currently operating beyond full employment', 'however the level of the unemployment rate that is consistent with full employment is not directly observable and thus must be estimated', 'for example in the summary of economic projections submitted in conjunction with the june meeting of the federal open market committee fomc the range of estimates for the longerrun normal unemployment rate is . to . percent', 'the decline in the unemployment rate in recent years has been accompanied by a pronounced increase in labor force participation for individuals in their prime working years', 'these increases in primeage participation have provided employers with a source of additional labor input and have been one factor restraining inflationary pressures', 'as with the unemployment rate whether participation will continue to increase in a tight labor market remains uncertain', 'for example african americans and hispanics have experienced persistently higher unemployment rates than whites for many decades', 'however those unemployment rate gaps have narrowed as the labor market has strengthened and there is some indication of an extra benefit to these groups as the unemployment rate moves into very low territory', 'likewise although unemployment rates for lesseducated workers are persistently higher than they are for their moreeducated counterparts such gaps appear to narrow as the labor market strengthens', 'scope of the review in the federal reserve act the congress assigned the federal reserve the responsibility to conduct monetary policy so as to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment stable prices and moderate longterm interest rates', 'our review this year takes this statutory mandate as given and also takes as given that inflation at a rate of  percent is most consistent over the longer run with the congressional mandate', 'our existing monetary policy strategy is laid out in the committees statement on longerrun goals and monetary policy strategy', 'the statement indicates that the committee seeks to mitigate deviations of inflation from  percent and deviations of employment from assessments of its maximum level', 'in doing so the fomc recognizes that these assessments of maximum employment are necessarily uncertain and subject to revision', 'according to the federal reserve act the employment objective is on an equal footing with the inflation objective', 'as a practical matter our current strategy shares many elements with the policy framework known in the research literature as flexible inflation targeting', 'however the feds mandate is much more explicit about the role of employment than that of most flexible inflationtargeting central banks and our statement reflects this by stating that when the two sides of the mandate are in conflict neither one takes precedent over the other', 'we believe this transparency about the balanced approach the fomc takes has served us well over the past decade when high unemployment called for extraordinary policies that entailed some risk of inflation', 'three questions the first question is can the federal reserve best meet its statutory objectives with its existing monetary policy strategy or should it consider strategies that aim to reverse past misses of the inflation objective', 'under our current approach as well as that of most flexible inflationtargeting central banks around the world the persistent shortfalls of inflation from  percent that many advanced economies have experienced over most of the past decade are treated as bygones', 'this means that policy today is not adjusted to offset past inflation shortfalls with future overshoots of the inflation target nor do persistent overshoots of inflation trigger policies that aim to undershoot the inflation target', 'central banks are generally believed to have effective tools for preventing persistent inflation overshoots but the elb on interest rates makes persistent undershoots more likely', 'persistent inflation shortfalls carry the risk that longerterm inflation expectations become poorly anchored or become anchored below the stated inflation goal', 'in part because of that concern some economists have advocated makeup strategies under which policymakers seek to undo in part or in whole past inflation deviations from target', 'such strategies include targeting average inflation over a multiyear period and pricelevel targeting in which policymakers seek to stabilize the price level around a constant growth path', 'for example the central bank could commit at the time when the policy rate reaches the elb to maintain the policy rate at this level until inflation over the elb period has on average run at the target rate', 'the benefits of the makeup strategies rest heavily on households and firms believing in advance that the makeup will in fact be delivered when the time comesfor example that a persistent inflation shortfall will be met by future inflation above  percent', 'as is well known from the research literature makeup strategies in general are not time consistent because when the time comes to push inflation above  percent conditions at that time will not warrant doing so', 'the next question the review will consider is are the existing monetary policy tools adequate to achieve and maintain maximum employment and price stability or should the toolkit be expanded', 'the fomcs primary means of changing the stance of monetary policy is by adjusting its target range for the federal funds rate', 'overall the empirical evidence suggests that these added tools helped stem the crisis and support economic recovery by strengthening the labor market and lifting inflation back toward  percent', 'these enhancements include the statement on longerrun goals and monetary policy strategy postmeeting press conferences various statements about the principles and strategy

influence of common global shocks affecting all economies in a similar way for example a slowdown in global productivity and the demographics associated with aging but also results from international capital flows that respond to and over time tend to narrow divergences in rates of return offered across different countries', 'in addition to the decline in r around the world lower longterm bond yields also reflect the influence of the initial downshift and ultimate anchoring of inflation expectations in many countries after the mids', 'unlike the decline in r which primarily reflects fundamental real factors that are outside the control of a central bank the decline and ultimate anchoring of inflation and inflation expectations in both major and many emerging economies were the direct consequence of the widespread adoption and commitment to transparent flexible inflationtargeting monetary policy strategies', 'for example in the united states after the collapse of bretton woods inflation spiraled upward hitting doubledigit rates in the s and early s', 'but by the mids the back of inflation had been broken thank you paul volcker and total personal consumption expenditure pce inflation averaged less than  percent from  to', 'following the  recession inflation fell further and by the mids the conditions for price stability in the united states had been achieved thank you alan greenspan', 'from the mids until the great recession u.s. pce inflation averaged about  percent', 'and of course this stepdown in inflation has been global with the other major advanced economies experiencing a similar shift down table  average inflation rates', 'many major emerging market economies as well have seen a remarkable and very welcome decline in average inflation rates as a result of adopting and delivering on credible inflationtargeting polices', 'to the extent that the stepdown in inflation is expected to persist which appears to be the case longterm yields have reflected this decline oneforone', 'however not only has the average level of inflation fallen but inflation has also become more stable', 'after considerable volatility in the s and s over the past few decades inflationespecially core inflation which excludes volatile food and energy priceshas with rare exceptions moved only within a relatively narrow range in many countries despite significant swings in the prices of oil and other commodities recessions the global financial crisis and unprecedented monetary policy actions', 'reflecting this inflation volatility as measured by the standard deviation in quarterly inflation rates has declined', 'see table  standard deviation of annualized quarterly headline inflation rates', 'what has been behind this global decline in inflation volatility', 'i would argue as have many others that monetary policy played a key role in reducing not only the average rate of inflation but also the volatility of inflation', 'inflationtargeting monetary policy can plausibly influence the variance of inflation through several channels', 'for example in a textbook dsge dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model clarida galí and gertler cgg  featuring a central bank that implements policy via a taylortype rule the equilibrium variance of inflation will be lower the more aggressively the central bank leans against exogenous shocks that push inflation away from target', 'so even if the variance of inflation shocks is constant the variance of inflation itself will be an endogenous function of monetary policy', 'another related channel through which monetary policy can influence the variance of inflation is by changing the equilibrium persistence of inflation deviations from target', 'in the textbook cgg model  augmented with a hybrid phillips curve that features an inertial backwardlooking component the equilibrium persistence of inflation is an endogenous function of the monetary policy rule such that the more aggressively the central bank leans against exogenous shocks that push inflation away from target the less persistent are inflation deviations from target in equilibrium', 'in the simple case in which equilibrium inflation is a firstorder autoregressive process as it is in the cgg  model under optimal policy the equilibrium unconditional variance of inflation is monotonic in inflation persistence for any given constant variance of inflation shocks', 'of course nonmonetary factors may also have contributed to a lower variance of inflation', 'for example the variance of underlying exogenous shocks to aggregate supply and demand may have fortuitously and coincidentally fallen in tandem with the adoption of inflation targeting in many countries', 'first the decline in inflation volatility has almost certainly been important in driving the term premium on nominal bonds lower', 'the real expost payoff from holding a nominal bond to maturity is directly exposed to pricelevel risk and thus all else being equal a decline in inflation volatility makes the real purchasing power of the bonds payoff less risky', 'through this channel the decline in inflation volatility should be reflected in a smaller inflation risk premium in nominal bond yields which is exactly what is estimated in the kim walsh and wei  yield curve model figure  term premium decomposition', 'indeed this yield curve model attributes around  basis points of the decline in the u.s. year nominal term premium since the early s to a decline in the inflation risk premium', 'a third contributor to a lower u.s. term premium is much less widely appreciated than lower inflation volatility and lsaps', 'as such we would expect the equilibrium yield on bonds to be lower than otherwise as investors should bid up their price to reflect their value as a hedge against equity risk relative to their value when the bond beta to stocks was positive', 'this paper develops and estimates a habit persistence consumption asset pricing model in which the sign of the equilibrium covariance between equity and bond returns depends on the reducedform correlation between inflation and the output gap the correlation between the federal funds rate and the output gap as well as the equilibrium persistence of inflation', 'cpv document in u.s. data for a sample spanning q to q that  the correlation between inflation and the output gap changed sign from negative to positive that  the correlation between the federal funds rate and the output gap changed sign also from negative to positive and that  the evidence of the sign change becomes statistically significant beginning in the late s', 'cpv also document that the transitory component of inflation becomes much less persistent after the estimated break in their sample', 'the cpv paper is agnostic as to why the reducedform correlation between inflation and the output gap and that between the federal funds rate and the output gap both change sign in their sample but the authors do demonstrate that in their asset pricing model these reducedform sign changes are sufficient to generate the sign change in the correlation between equity and bond returns that we observe in the data', 'i myself believe that the change in the u.s. monetary policy regime that began in  under paul volcker and that was extended by alan greenspan in the s very likely contributed to the change in the sign of the correlation between inflation and the output gap as well as the change in sign of the correlation between the federal funds rate and the output gap that we observe in the data clarida galí and gertler', 'these are the sorts of patterns that a simple model of optimal monetary policy would produce when starting from an initial condition in which inflation is well above the implicit target as was the case in', 'high initial inflation triggers a policy response for the central bank to push up the real policy rate well above inflation in order to push output below potential which via the phillips curve will over time lower inflation toward the target', 'if this policy succeeds ex post inflation expectations become anchored at the new lower level of inflation and policy can then respond to demand shocks by adjusting real rates procyclically the opposite of what is required when initial inflation is too high and inflation expectations are not anchored', 'inflation will also be procyclical with wellanchored inflation expectations if demand shocks dominate and inflation expectations remain anchored', 'implications for monetary policy the federal reserves framework review by lowering expected inflation by anchoring expected inflation at a low level by contributing to a reduction in the volatility of inflationand

review although i will have more to say about the review in a moment let me state at the outset that we believe our existing framework which has been in place since  has served us well and has enabled us to achieve and sustain our statutorily assigned goals of maximum employment and price stability', 'with the u.s. economy operating at or close to maximum employment and price stability now is an especially opportune time to conduct this review', 'the unemployment rate is near a year low and inflation is running close to our  percent objective', 'perhaps most significantly neutral interest rates appear to have fallen in the united states', 'that development in turn could make it more difficult during downturns for monetary policy to support spending and employment and to keep inflation from falling too far below the central banks objective percent in the case of the federal reserve', 'another key development in recent decades is that price inflation appears less responsive to resource slack', 'that is the shortrun price phillips curveif not the wage phillips curveappears to have flattened implying a change in the dynamic relationship between inflation and employment', 'a flatter phillips curve permits the federal reserve to support employment more aggressively during downturnsas was the case during and after the great recessionbecause a sustained inflation breakout is less likely when the phillips curve is flatter', 'however a flatter phillips curve also increases the cost in terms of lost economic output of reversing unwelcome increases in longerrun inflation expectations', 'thus a flatter phillips curve makes it all the more important that inflation expectations remain anchored at levels consistent with our  percent inflation objective', 'based on the evidence i have reviewed i judge that u.s. inflation expectations today do reside at the low end of a range i consider consistent with our pricestability mandate', 'a robust u.s. labor market for some time now price stability in the united states has coincided with a historically low unemployment rate', 'this low unemployment rate . percent in october has been interpreted by many as suggesting that the labor market is currently operating beyond full employment', 'however we cannot directly observe the level of the unemployment rate that is consistent with full employment and price stability u but must infer it from data via models', 'i myself believe that the range of plausible estimates of u extends to  percent and below and includes the current unemployment rate of . percent', 'as the unemployment rate has declined in recent years labor force participation for people in their prime working years has increased significantly with the october participation rate at a cycle high of . percent', 'increased primeage participation has provided employers with additional labor resources and has been one factor along with a pickup in labor productivity restraining inflationary pressures', 'also although the labor market is robust there is no evidence that rising wages are putting excessive upward pressure on price inflation', 'wages today are increasing broadly in line with productivity growth and underlying inflation', 'in recent cyclesand thus far in this cyclethis rise in labors share has not put excessive upward pressure on price inflation', 'scope of the review the federal reserve act instructs the fed to conduct monetary policy so as to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment stable prices and moderate longterm interest rates', 'our review this year takes this statutory mandate as given and also takes as given that inflation at a rate of  percent is most consistent over the longer run with the congressional mandate', 'our existing monetary policy strategy is laid out in the committees statement on longerrun goals and monetary policy strategy', 'first adopted in january  the statement indicates that the committee seeks to mitigate deviations of inflation from  percent and deviations of employment from assessments of its maximum level', 'in doing so the federal open market committee fomc recognizes that these assessments of maximum employment are necessarily uncertain and subject to revision', 'as a practical matter our current strategy shares many elements with the policy framework known as flexible inflation targeting', 'however the feds mandate is much more explicit about the role of employment than that of most flexible inflationtargeting central banks and our statement reflects this by stating that when the two sides of the mandate are in conflict neither one takes precedence over the other', 'three questions the first question is can the federal reserve best meet its statutory objectives with its existing monetary policy strategy or should it consider strategies that aim to reverse past misses of the inflation objective', 'under our current approach as well as the approaches of many central banks around the world

interest rates makes persistent undershoots more of a challenge', 'persistent inflation shortfalls carry the risk that longerterm inflation expectations become anchored below the stated inflation goal', 'in part because of that concern some economists have advocated makeup strategies under which policymakers seek to undo past inflation deviations from target', 'these strategies include targeting average inflation and pricelevel targeting in which policymakers seek to stabilize the price level around a constant growth path', 'the success of makeup strategies relies on households and firms believing in advance that the makeup will in fact be delivered when the time comesfor example that a persistent inflation shortfall will be met by future inflation above  percent', 'as is well known from the research literature makeup strategies in general are not time consistent because when the time comes to push inflation above  percent conditions at that time will not justify that action', 'the next question the review is considering is are existing monetary policy tools adequate to achieve and maintain maximum employment and price stability or should the toolkit be expanded',

important input into standard interest rate feedback rules such as those introduced by john taylor in  and ones that continue today to inform monetary policy decisions at the fed and at other central banks', 'monetary policy however also needs to be data dependent in the second sensethat incoming data contain signalsthat can enable the central bank to update its estimates of r and u in order to obtain its best estimate of the destination to which the economy is heading', 'as i mentioned a moment ago a challenge for policymakers is that key variables that are essential inputs to monetary policysuch as u r and expected inflationcannot be observed directly and must be inferred from observed data', 'and as is indicated in the summary of economic projections federal open market committee

unanimous approval and release of a new statement on longerrun goals and monetary policy strategy', 'first i will discuss the factors that motivated the federal reserve in november  to announce it would undertake in  the firstever public review of its monetary policy strategy tools and communication practices', 'third i will briefly summarize the flexible inflationtargeting strategy that has been guiding u.s. monetary policy since  in the context of some important changes in the economic landscape that have become evident since', 'fourth i will discuss the major findings of the review as codified in our new statement on longerrun goals and monetary policy strategy and highlight some important policy implications that flow from them', 'indeed i would argue that over the past eight years the framework served us well and supported the federal reserves efforts after the global financial crisis gfc first to achieve and then for several years to sustainuntil cut short this spring by the covid pandemicthe operation of the economy at or close to both our statutorily assigned goals of maximum employment and price stability in what became the longest economic expansion in u.s. history', 'perhaps the most significant change since  in our understanding of the economy is our reassessment of the neutral real interest rate r that over the longer run is consistent with our maximumemployment and pricestability mandates', 'in january  the median fomc participant projected a longrun r of . percent which in tandem with the inflation goal of  percent indicated a neutral setting for the federal funds rate of . percent', 'the substantial decline in the neutral policy rate since  has critical implications for the design implementation and communication of federal reserve monetary policy because it leaves the fomc with less conventional policy space to cut rates to offset adverse shocks to aggregate demand', 'this development in turn makes it more likely that recessions will impart elevated risks of more persistent downward pressure on inflation and upward pressure on unemployment that the federal reserves monetary policy should in design and implementation seek to offset throughout the business cycle and not just in downturns themselves', 'two other related developments that have also become more evident than they appeared in  are that price inflation seems less responsive to resource slack and also that estimates of resource slack based on historically estimated price phillips curve relationships are less reliable and subject to more material revision than was once commonly believed', 'for example in the face of declining unemployment rates that did not result in excessive costpush pressure to price inflation the median of the committees projections of uthe rate of unemployment consistent in the longer run with the  percent inflation objectivehas been repeatedly revised lower from . percent in january  to . percent as of the june  sep.  projections of u by the congressional budget office and professional forecasters show a similar decline during this same period and for the same reason', 'in the past several years of the previous expansion declines in the unemployment rate occurred in tandem with a notable and to me welcome increase in real wages that was accompanied by an increase in labors share of national income but not a surge in price inflation to a pace inconsistent with our pricestability mandate and wellanchored inflation expectations', 'indeed this pattern of midcycle declines in unemployment coincident with noninflationary increases in real wages has been evident in the u.s. data since the s', 'with regard to inflation expectations there is broad agreement among academics and policymakers that achieving price stability on a sustainable basis requires that inflation expectations be well anchored at the rate of inflation consistent with the pricestability goal', 'this is especially true in the world that prevails today with flat phillips curves in which the primary determinant of actual inflation is expected inflation', 'the pregfc academic literature derived the important result that a credible inflationtargeting monetary policy strategy that is not constrained by the elb can deliver under rational expectations inflation expectations that themselves are well anchored at the inflation target', 'in other words absent a binding elb constraint a policy that targets actual inflation in these models delivers longrun inflation expectations well anchored at the target for free', 'but this copacetic coincidence no longer holds in a world of low r in which adverse aggregate demand shocks are expected to drive the economy in at least some downturns to the elb', 'in this case which is obviously relevant today economic analysis indicates that flexible inflationtargeting monetary policy cannot be relied on to deliver inflation expectations that are anchored at the target but instead will tend to deliver inflation expectations that in each business cycle become anchored at a level below the target', 'indeed johns research over the past  years on r estimation and monetary policy design at the elb have been enormously influential not only in the profession but also at fed and certainly in my own thinking about how our framework should evolve', 'this downward bias in inflation expectations under inflation targeting in an elb world can in turn reduce already scarce policy spacebecause nominal interest rates reflect both real rates and expected inflationand it can open up the risk of the downward spiral in both actual and expected inflation that has been observed in some other major economies', 'inflation expectations are of course not directly observed and must be imperfectly inferred from surveys financial market data and econometric models', 'but at minimum the failure of actual pce personal consumption expenditures inflationcore or headlineover the past eight years to reach the  percent goal on a sustained basis cannot have contributed favorably to keeping inflation expectations anchored at  percent', 'indeed my reading of the evidence is that the various measures of inflation expectations i follow reside at the low end of a range i consider consistent with our  percent inflation goal', 'in november  the federal reserve announced that in  the system would undertake a wideranging public review of its monetary policy strategy tools and communication practices', 'this initiative would be the firstever public review of monetary policy strategy ever undertaken by the fed', 'a new economic landscape compels a framework rethink as i mentioned earlier the committee devoted five consecutive fomc meetings between july  and january  to presentations by the staff and committee discussions of memos touching on various aspects of the framework review and it held a lengthy discussion at the july  fomc meeting about the new statement on longerrun goals and monetary policy strategy', 'while it is fair to say that these committee discussions revealed among the  participants a healthy range of views about and priorities for refining our framework and strategy some common themes did emerge and these provided the foundation for the revised statement on longerrun goals and monetary policy strategy that the committee discussed in july approved last week and released on thursday august', 'broadly we agreed that the economic landscape has changed in important ways since  and that as a result the existing statement and the monetary policy strategy that flows from it need as well to evolve along several dimensions', 'for example under our previous flexible inflationtargeting framework the federal reserve declared that the  percent inflation objective is symmetric', 'this term has been interpreted by many observers to mean that the committees reaction function aimed to be symmetric on either side of the  percent inflation goal and that the fomc set policy with the ex ante aim that the  percent goal should represent an inflation ceiling in economic expansions following economic downturns in which inflation falls below target', 'regarding the elb the previous statement was silent on the global decline in neutral policy rates the likelihood that the elb will constrain monetary policy space in economic downturns and the implications of this constraint for our ability to achieve our dualmandate goals', 'as for inflation expectations the previous statement did discuss expected inflation but only in the context of mentioning that the announcement of a  percent goal helps anchor inflation expectations', 'while this is certainly true it does beg the deeper question of how well anchored inflation expectations can be if the  percent goal is seen by the public asand turns out ex post to bea ceiling', 'regarding the maximumemployment leg of the dual mandate the previous statements discussion of minimizing deviations of employment from its maximum level does not adequately reflect how the fomc has actually conducted monetary policy in recent yearsbefore the pandemicas the actual unemployment rate was declining and for several years remained below sep median projections of u although to be sure the earlier statement did acknowledge that it can be difficult to estimate the maximum level of employment with precision', 'the new statement and strategy before discussing how our statement on longerrun goals and monetary policy strategy has evolved let me highlight some important elements that remain unchanged', 'second our statement continues to note that the maximum level of employment that we are mandated to achieve is not directly measurable and changes over time for reasons unrelated to monetary policy', 'hence we continue not to specify a numerical goal for our employment objective as we do for inflation', 'third we continue to state that an inflation rate of  percent over the longer run is most consistent with our mandate to promote both maximum employment and price stability', 'finally because the effect of monetary policy on the economy operates with a lag our strategy remains forward looking', 'with respect to the new framework itself the statement now notes that the neutral level of the federal funds rate has declined relative to its historical average and therefore that the policy rate is more likely than in the past to be constrained by its elb and moreover that this binding elb constraint is likely to impart downside risks to inflation and employment that the committee needs to consider in implementing its monetary policy strategy', 'regarding the maximumemployment mandate the new statement now acknowledges that maximum employment is a broadbased and inclusive goal and continues to state that the fomc considers a wide range of indicators to assess the level of maximum employment consistent with this broadbased goal', 'however under our new framework policy decisions going forward will be based on the fomcs estimates of shortfalls of employment from its maximum levelnot deviations', 'this change conveys our judgment that a low unemployment rate by itself in the absence of evidence that price inflation is running or is likely to run persistently above mandateconsistent levels or pressing financial stability concerns will not under our new framework be a sufficient trigger for policy action', 'this is a robust evolution in the federal reserves policy framework and to me reflects the reality that econometric models of maximum employment while essential inputs to monetary policy can be and have been wrong and moreover that a decision to tighten monetary policy based solely on a model without any other evidence of excessive costpush pressure that puts the pricestability mandate at risk is difficult to justify given the significant cost to the economy if the model turns out to be wrong and given the ability of monetary policy to respond if the model were eventually to turn out to be right', 'with regard to the pricestability mandate while the new statement maintains our definition that the longerrun goal for inflation is  percent it elevates the importanceand the challengeof keeping inflation expectations well anchored at  percent and not just well anchored in a world of low r and an elb constraint that is binding in downturns', 'to this end the new statement conveys the committees judgment that in order to anchor expectations at  percent it seeks to achieve inflation that averages  percent over time andin the same sentencethat therefore following periods when inflation has been running persistently below  percent appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above  percent for some time', 'this is the second robust evolution of our framework and it reflects the inherent asymmetry of conducting monetary policy in a low r world with an elb constraint that binds in economic downturns', 'as discussed earlier if policy seeks only to return inflation to  percent following a downturn in which the elb has constrained policy an inflationtargeting monetary policy will tend to generate inflation that averages less than  percent which in turn will tend to put persistent downward pressure on inflation expectations and potentially on available policy space', 'in order to offset this downward bias our new framework recognizes that monetary policy during economic expansions needs to aim to achieve inflation moderately above  percent for some time', 'in other words the aim to achieve symmetric outcomes for inflation as would be the case under flexible inflation targeting in the absence of the elb constraint requires an asymmetric monetary policy reaction function in a low r world with binding elb constraints in economic downturns', 'it is for this reason that while our new statement no longer refers to the  percent inflation goal as symmetric it does now say that the committee seeks to achieve inflation that averages  percent over time', 'to be clear inflation that averages  percent over time represents an ex ante aspiration not a description of a mechanical reaction functionnor is it a commitment to conduct monetary policy tethered to any particular formula or rule', 'indeed as summarized in the minutes of the september  fomc meeting the committee and certainly i was skeptical about the benefit credibility or practicality of adopting a formal numerical price level or average inflation target rule just as it has been unwilling to implement its existing flexible inflationtargeting strategy via any sort of mechanical rule', 'so in practice what then is the policy implication of this stated desire to achieve inflation that averages  percent over time', 'again the implication of our new strategy for monetary policy is stated explicitly in the new statement and at the risk of repeating myself let me restate it verbatim following periods when inflation has been running persistently below  percent appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above  percent for some time', 'as chair powell indicated in his remarks last week we think of this new strategy as an evolution from flexible inflation targeting to flexible average inflation targeting', 'concluding thoughts my remarks today have been focused on our new framework and flexible average inflation targeting strategy', 'with regard to other monetary policy tools and as we have made clear previously in the minutes to our october  fomc meeting we do not see negative policy rates as an attractive policy option in the u.s. context', 'it was the right statement and flexible inflation targeting was the right strategy at that time and for the next eight years', 'the existing framework served us well by supporting the federal reserves efforts after the gfc first to achieve and then for several years to sustain the operation of the economy at or close to both our statutorily assigned goals of maximum employment and price stability', 'my colleagues and i believe that this new framework represents a

monetary policy and how i plan to factor in this information as i think about the appropriate path for setting the federal funds rate once the conditions for liftoff have been met', 'the new framework and price stability in my remarks today i will focus on six key elements of our new framework and the forward guidance provided by our september fomc statement', 'five of these elements define how the committee will seek to achieve its pricestability mandate over time while the sixth pertains to the committees conception of its maximumemployment mandate', 'of course the committees pricestability and maximumemployment mandates are generally complementary and indeed this complementarity is recognized and respected in the forwardguidance language introduced in the september fomc statement', 'however for ease of exposition i will begin by focusing on the five elements of the new framework that define how the committee will seek to achieve over time its pricestability mandate before discussing how maximum employment is defined in the new framework and what this definition implies for the conduct and communication of monetary policy under the new framework', 'five features of the new framework and september fomc statement define how the committee will seek to achieve its pricestability mandate over time the committee expects to delay liftoff from the elb until pce personal consumption expenditures inflation has risen to  percent on an annual basis and other complementary conditions consistent with achieving this goal on a sustained basis and to be discussed later are met', 'with inflation having run persistently below  percent the committee will aim to achieve inflation moderately above  percent for some time in the service of having inflation average  percent over time and keeping longerterm inflation expectations well anchored at the  percent longerrun goal', 'the committee expects that appropriate monetary policy will remain accommodative for some time after the conditions to commence policy normalization have been met', 'policy will aim over time to return inflation to its longerrun goal which remains  percent but not below once the conditions to commence policy normalization have been met', 'inflation that averages  percent over time represents an ex ante aspiration of the fomc but not a timeinconsistent ex post commitment', 'i believe that a useful way to summarize the framework defined by these five features is temporary pricelevel targeting tplt at the elb that reverts to flexible inflation targeting once the conditions for liftoff have been reached', 'first element a policy that delays liftoff from the elb until a threshold for average inflation has been reached is one element of a tplt strategy', 'in our september fomc statement we communicated that along with other complementary conditions inflation must have risen to  percent before we expect to lift off from the elb', 'this condition refers to inflation on an annual basis', 'second element an alternative version of tplt would commit the central bank to delay liftoff until inflation has averaged  percent over a longer periodsay three years bernanke kiley and roberts  study the case of tplt with a threeyear memory as well as the case of tplt with a oneyear memory or perhaps an even longer period that commences when the policy rate hits the elb itself as in bernankes a original tplt proposal', 'in these versions of tplt inflation would likely have to moderately exceed  percent for some time before the condition for liftoff is met', 'for example if tplt with a threeyear memory were chosen and inflation in three consecutive years equaled . percent  percent and . percent then liftoff would not occur until inflation hit . percent for one year', 'note however that tplt with a longer memory does not define ex ante the amount by which inflation must exceed  percent before liftoff is considered nor does it specify for how long inflation exceeds  percent before liftoff is considered', 'for example under tplt with a threeyear memory if inflation instead equaled . percent  percent and . percent for three consecutive years then liftoff ex post could not occur until inflation hit . percent for one year', 'but if instead inflation equaled . percent . percent and . percent then inflation would exceed  percent for two years before liftoff were contemplated', 'in the case of the federal reserve the fomc chose a oneyear memory for the inflation threshold that must be met before liftoff is considered but it also indicated in september that the committee expects to delay liftoff until inflation is on track to moderately exceed  percent for some time', 'crucially the committees judgment on the projected duration and magnitude of the deviation from the  percent inflation goal will at the time of liftoff and every three months thereafter be communicated in the quarterly summary of economic projections sep for inflation', 'for example in  as the fomc factored in an unexpected tailwind from a midcycle fiscal expansion and chose to maintain a gradual pace of normalization to return the federal funds rate to its projected neutral stance the median participant at the september  fomc meeting projected that core pce inflation would moderately exceed  percent for three years', 'the fomc statement itself can in the new regime also be used as a platform to communicate the committees tolerance for deviations of inflation from the  percent longerrun goal and indeed it has served this purpose in the pastfor example with the thresholdbased guidance linked to inflation outcomes introduced in the fomc statement in december', 'once the conditions to commence policy normalization have been met the sep dot plot will convey the median participants projections over a threeyear horizon not only for inflation but also for the pace of liftoff as well as the ultimate destination for the policy rate', 'that is as in bernanke kiley and roberts  the goal of monetary policy after lifting off from the elb is to return inflation to its  percent longerrun goal but not to push inflation below  percent', 'in other words after liftoff from the elb monetary policy reverts to simple flexible inflation targeting bernanke b', 'in the bernanke kiley and roberts  study flexible inflation targeting postliftoff is implemented with an inertial taylor rule that satisfies the taylor principle that is the policy responds to the difference between actual inflation and the  percent target with a coefficient that exceeds unity', 'the policy is flexible in that the desired pace of return to  percent can reflect considerations other than the  percent longerrun goal for inflation that are relevant to the committees mandate', 'in the case of the federal reserve we have highlighted that making sure that inflation expectations remain anchored at our  percent objective is just such a consideration', 'speaking for myself i follow closely the fed staffs index of common inflation expectations cie as a relevant indicator that this goal is being met', 'other things being equal if at the time of liftoff the cie index is below its preelb level then my desired pace of policy normalization postliftoff to return inflation to  percentas well as the projected pace of return to  percent inflationwould be somewhat slower than if the cie index at the time of liftoff is equal to its preelb level', 'another factor i will consider in calibrating the pace of policy normalization postliftoff is the average rate of pce inflation since the new framework was adopted in august a time as it happened that the federal funds rate was constrained at the elb', 'if average inflation since august  turns out to be notably below  percent then my desired pace of policy normalization postliftoffand the implied pace of return to  percent inflationwould other things being equal be somewhat slower than if average inflation since adoption was close to or equal to  percent', 'it is important to note however that the goal of the new framework is to keep inflation expectations well anchored at  percent and for this reason i myself plan to focus more on indicators of inflation expectations themselvesespecially surveybased measuresthan i will on the calculation of an average rate of inflation over any particular window of time', 'fifth element our framework aims ex ante for inflation to average  percent over time but it does not make a timeinconsistent commitment to achieve ex post inflation outcomes that average  percent under any and all circumstances and constellations of shocks', 'in this regime the only way in which average inflation enters the policy rule is through the timing of liftoff itself', 'yet in stochastic simulations of the frbus model under tplt with a oneyear memory that reverts to flexible inflation targeting after liftoff inflation does average very close to  percent in the stochastic simulations reported in their paper', 'the model of mertens and williams  delivers a similar outcome even though the policy reaction function in their model does not incorporate an ex post makeup element it delivers a longrun unconditional average rate of inflation equal to target by aiming for a moderate inflation overshoot away from the elb that is calibrated to offset the inflation shortfall caused by the elb', 'looking ahead we will continue to monitor developments and assess how our ongoing asset purchases can best support achieving our maximumemployment and pricestability objectives', 'in this regard i note that the simulation results reported in bernanke  suggest that in general a monetary policy at the elb that combines threshold forward guidance such as i have discussed in these remarks with largescale asset purchases such as we have had in place since march is best equipped ex ante to achieve inflation outcomes that are consistent with price stability and wellanchored inflation expectations at the  percent objective', 'the new framework and maximum employment an important evolution in our new framework is that the committee now defines maximum employment as the highest level of employment that does not generate sustained pressures that put the pricestability mandate at risk', 'as a practical matter this definition means to me that when the unemployment rate is elevated relative to my sep projection of its longrun level and other indicatorssuch as the primeage employmenttopopulation and labor force participation ratiosare depressed relative to recent business cycle peaks monetary policy should as before continue to be calibrated to eliminate such employment shortfalls as long as doing so does not put the pricestability mandate at risk', 'indeed in our september fomc statement we indicated that we expect it will be appropriate to keep the federal funds rate in the current  to  basis point target range until inflation has reached  percent on an annual basis and labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the committees assessment of maximum employment', 'in our new framework when in a business cycle expansion labor market indicators return to a range that in the committees judgment is broadly consistent with its maximumemployment mandate it will be data on inflation itself that policy will react to but going forward policy will not tighten solely because the unemployment rate has fallen below any particular econometric estimate of its longrun natural level', 'in particular i will continueas i have done since joining the fedto consult policy rules that respect the taylor principle as a benchmark for calibrating the pace and destination of policy rate normalization once after the inflation and employment thresholds have been reached the process of policy normalization commences', 'consistent with our new framework the relevant policy rule benchmark i will consult after the conditions for liftoff have been met is an inertial taylortype rule with a coefficient of zero on the unemployment gap a coefficient of . on the gap between core pce inflation and the  percent longerrun goal and a neutral real policy rate equal to my sep projection of longrun r', 'such a reference rule which becomes relevant once the conditions for policy normalization have been met is similar to the forwardlooking taylortype rule for optimal monetary policy derived in clarida galí and gertler', 'the stability properties of taylortype rules in dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models have been studied by bullard and mitra  and galí  among others and they show that for the standard taylor coefficient of . on the inflation gap and a coefficient of zero on the unemployment gap the rational expectations equilibrium is unique for standard parametrizations', 'one dimension along which our new framework may appear to differ from the threshold forwardguidance proposals advocated by some others is that our september fomc guidance explicitly requires that at the time of liftoff in addition to inflation reaching  percent on an annual basis labor market conditions must have also reached levels consistent with the committees assessments of maximum employment and i offered earlier the metrics on some of the labor market indicators i will follow to make that assessment', 'however any difference between our september fomc guidance and similar threshold guidance policies that depend only on realized inflation is i believe more apparent than real', 'the reason is that proponents of inflationbased threshold guidance typically acknowledge that liftoff following an elb episode should be conditioned on the judgment that inflation has sustainably reached the target before liftoff is contemplated bernanke b and such an assessment of sustainability in most circumstances would i believe be informed by an assessment of labor market conditions reifschneider and wilcox', 'the committee confronted just this situation in the first half of  when core pce inflation reached  percent at a time when the unemployment rate remained elevated at . percent well above the top of the range of fomc estimates of its longerrun normal level', 'concluding remarks in closing i think of our new flexible average inflationtargeting framework as a combination of tplt at the elb with flexible inflation targeting to which tplt reverts once the conditions to commence policy normalization articulated in our september  fomc statement have been met', 'the committee is committed to using all available tools including

monetary policy coordination or in the limit binding global monetary cooperation', 'indeed the international monetary economics literature abounds with historical and empirical studies of correlated global monetary policy cycles not to mention the evident secular downtrend in global monetary policy rates observed in recent decades', 'to begin with the theory it has long been appreciated that in the sorts of economic models used by central banks around the world the calibrated gains to international monetary policy cooperation are found to be rather modest relative to a status quo ante in which each country runs a sensible policy taking as given the sensible policies of the other countries', 'today i will make a somewhat different and less often discussed case questioning formal global monetary policy cooperationthat in practice adopting it could plausibly erode central bank credibility and public support for central bank instrument independence', 'international monetary policy coordination which i think of as including the sharing of information and analysis among central banks regarding the evolution of their individual economies as well as the considerations that govern the setting of their policy instrumentsin other words information about their policy reaction functions can and in my observation certainly does enhance the design and effectiveness of monetary policy execution for each country', 'but while international monetary policy coordination may enhance the efficiency of monetary policy execution i am skeptical that in practice there are additional material reliable and robust gains that would flow from a formal regime of binding monetary policy cooperation at least among major g economies with flexible exchange rates open capital accounts and central bank mandates that include price stability', 'in such a regime national monetary policies in each country would be constrained to be set in such a way so as to jointly maximize some metric for global price stability and perhaps also other objectives', 'the reason is that there can be global externalities to monetary policy that create such theoretical gains to cooperation', 'however as clarida galí and gertler  among others have shown in the context of central banks with domestic pricestability mandates to achieve the theoretical gains to international monetary policy cooperation policy in each country must be set with reference to an index of inflation in all countries party to the cooperative agreement', 'this is a policy that no central bank would choose were it not bound to the agreement to achieve domestic price stability while taking other central banks policies as given which of course raises the question of how such an agreement might be enforced', 'but in practice no sovereign central bank outsources its policy to an excel spreadsheet and moreover bestpractice policy rules incorporate inputssuch as the neutral rate of interest or expected inflationthat are unobserved and time varying and thus difficult to monitor', 'for example the federal reserve is mandated to pursue policies that achieve maximum employment and price stability', 'the european central bank ecb is mandated by treaty to pursue price stability but also has a secondary mandate to contribute to achieving the objectives of the european union which include balanced economic growth and full employment', 'similarly the bank of englands primary objective is to achieve the u.k. governments target of  percent inflation but its secondary objective is to support the governments policy aims including those for employment growth andmore recentlyenvironmental sustainability', 'so even though all major central banks are mandated to achieve price stability in some form or fashion their mandates typically include other obligations that vary across jurisdictions', 'because these obligations can and sometimes do require central banks to make a tradeofffor example in the united states between inflation and employment in the presence of supply shocksdefining the objective that a cooperative agreement would choose to maximize would be a formidable task', 'simply stated and in the context of a pricestability mandate for each central bank the problemas i see itis the threat to the credibility of the central bank the challenges to central bank communication and the resulting potential loss of support for its policy actions from the public when the policy choices that would be required by binding monetary policy cooperation react not only to home inflation deviations from target but also to deviations of foreign inflation from target', 'in theoretical models the commitment to the inflation target is just assumed to be perfect and credible but in practice credibility appears to be a function of central bank communication and of the policies actually implemented pushing inflation towardand in the absence of shocks keeping inflation attarget', 'i suspect that in practice central banks would have a hard time maintaining credibility and independence as well as communicating a policy that raised home interest rates aggressively not because home inflation is too high but because foreign inflation is', 'while perhaps for these reasons we do not have many confirmed sightings of genuine binding monetary policy cooperation we do observe many examples of monetary policy correlation see figure', 'in the home country the optimal inflationtargeting monetary policy can be written as a taylortype rule r_t r_t  fraclambdaalphapi_t where r_t is the neutral interest rate in the home country consistent with price stability and trend growth and pi_t is inflation in the home country', 'the ratio lambdaalpha captures the extent to which the home central bank trades off its inflation and gross domestic product gdp objectives when they are in conflict', 'the parameter alpha indexes the priority the central bank places on stabilizing gdp growth relative to its trend path', 'when alpha is large the central bank leans against high inflation less aggressively than it would were alpha small', 'with an integrated global capital market the neutral policy rate at home is a function of trend gdp growth at home as well as expected foreign gdp growth r_t e_tdelta bary_t e_tdelta y_t', 'now to the extent the foreign central bank has a comparative advantage in tracking or forecasting foreign output growthwhich of course it should since such growth will depend on the foreign central banks monetary policysharing this information with the home central bank can improve that institutions estimate of the home equilibrium real interest rate and thus the effectiveness of its policy rule in meeting its domestic objectives', 'the ratio lambdaalpha captures the extent to which the foreign central bank trades off its inflation and gdp objectives when they are in conflict and note that this tradeoff may be different than that of the home central bank', 'for example even if home and foreign inflation rates and trend growth rates are uncorrelated across countries sensible monetary policies can be correlated across countries if neutral policy rates are correlated as they appear to be in the data see figure  which is based on holston laubach and williams', 'a recent working paper ferreira and shousha  models the determinants of the neutral policy rate in the united states and includes in the empirical specification an index of global productivity growth and demographic trends', 'their empirical estimates attribute  basis points of the decline in u.s. neutral real interest rates since  to global spillovers from the slowdown in global trend growth and demographic trends', 'so policy correlation can be an outcome of noncooperative monetary policy operating in an integrated global capital market and not evidence in and of itself of policy coordination let alone cooperation', 'before continuing i consider briefly how monetary policy would differ under binding cooperation in the simple example sketched out earlier', 'under international monetary policy cooperation the policy rate is set according to r_t r_t  fraclambdaalphapi_t

discussed earlier', 'consider the case with home inflation high and foreign inflation low', 'as can be seen from the preceding equation the optimal policy under cooperation calls for the home interest rate to be lowermore accommodativethan it would be in the absence of cooperation', 'in practice the home central banks credibility as an inflation targeter to satisfy its domestic pricestability mandate might well suffer if it failed to respond aggressively to high domestic inflation because of say serious deflation abroad', 'monetary policy spillovers flow in both directions there is a vast literature that documents the existence of international spillovers from u.s. monetary policy especially to emerging markets ems', 'recent researchhoek kamin and yoldas suggests that the extent and consequences of such spillovers depend importantly on the source of a shift in u.s. monetary policy', 'their key finding illustrated in figure  is that federal reserve policy rate surprises attributed to stronger u.s. growth generally have only moderate spillovers to em financial conditions whereas u.s. policy rate changes attributed to u.s. inflationary pressures trigger more substantial spillovers to em financial conditions', 'the authors also find compelling evidence that the magnitude of the crossborder spillovers attributed to u.s. monetary policy shifts depends on a countrys macroeconomic vulnerabilityas measured by inflation current account deficit international reserves government debt external debt and privatesector credit growth with more vulnerable em countries experiencing larger spillovers from u.s. monetary policy', 'while i will certainly acknowledge that both fundamental and financial shocks originating in the united states including shifts in the direction of u.s. monetary policy can and do propagate globally see for example mirandaagrippino and rey forthcoming the evidence suggests that causality can and does run in both directions', 'it is not difficult to recall external events that have triggered spillovers from foreign sovereign markets to the u.s. economy that have had observable implications for u.s. monetary policy', 'the mexican peso crisis of  and the asian financial crisis of  resulted in substantial declines in economic activity in emerging markets but had only a modest effect on the u.s. economy', 'in more recent times

weighing on aggregate demand', 'u.s. monetary policy responded to these global headwinds helping stave off actual contractions of u.s. activity', 'during the  eurozone crisis the federal reserve was already pursuing very accommodative policies in the wake of the gfc but the introduction of the maturity extension program in september  and the announcement in september  of the third installment of quantitative easing were in part aimed at offsetting the effect of these global headwinds on u.s. aggregate demand', 'the federal reserve and ecb framework reviews the monetary policy framework reviews conducted by the federal reserve and the ecb provide another example of monetary policy correlation', 'in february  the federal reserve system launched a review of its monetary policy strategy tools and communication practices', 'a key motivation for the feds review as well as the ecbs review was the substantial decline in estimates of the neutral real interest rate r that over the longer run is consistent with price stability', 'this decline has critical implications for monetary policy because it leaves central banks with less conventional policy space to offset adverse shocks to aggregate demand', 'while our plans to conclude the review earlier in  were like so many things delayed by the arrival of the pandemic in august  the federal reserve did announce with unanimous support an evolution of its monetary policy strategy to flexible average inflation targeting', 'similar to the federal reserve the ecb launched a review of its monetary policy strategy in january', 'since the time of its previous strategy review in  like the fed the ecb observed profound structural changes in the global and euroarea economies that have driven down neutral interest rates and increased the incidence and duration of episodes in which nominal policy interest rates are close to the elb', 'so the ecbs review sought to adapt its monetary policy to the current economic environment and to ensure that its policy could remain effective at the elb', 'key elements of that strategy are a symmetric  percent inflation target a view that the elb requires especially forceful or persistent monetary policy measures to keep inflation expectations from drifting lower and the affirmation that the full range of measures it has used in recent years will remain in its toolkit', 'the similarities in the two framework evolutions are due to the fact that powerful common global forces are driving down neutral policy rates and limiting the effectiveness of monetary policy in downturns to offset declines in aggregate demand', 'this asymmetry of policy effectiveness caused by the elb imparts a secular downward bias to inflation that if not offset could deanchor inflation expectations below the central banks pricestability objectives', 'conclusion in this speech i have offered some perspectives on global monetary policy correlation and what it canand cannotreveal about

seven years ago from an unemployment rate of  percent which guaranteed a lengthy period of high unemployment', 'even so with inflation expectations apparently stable we would have expected the gradual reduction of slack to be associated with less downward price pressure', 'all else equal we might therefore have expected both headline and core inflation to be moving up more noticeably toward our  percent objective', 'yet we have seen no clear evidence of core inflation moving higher over the past few years', 'this fact helps drive home an important point while much evidence points to at least some ongoing role for slack in helping to explain movements in inflation this influence is typically estimated to be modest in magnitude and can easily be masked by other factors', 'in the first instance as already noted core inflation can to some extent be influenced by oil prices', 'however a larger effect comes from changes in the exchange value of the dollar and the rise in the dollar over the past year is an important reason inflation has remained low chart', 'a higher value of the dollar passes through to lower import prices which hold down u.s. inflation both because imports make up part of final consumption and because lower prices for imported components hold down business costs more generally', 'in addition a rise in the dollar restrains the growth of aggregate demand and overall economic activity and so has some effect on inflation through that more indirect channel', 'to get a sense of the timing and magnitude of these exchange rate effects chart  shows dynamic simulations of a  percent real dollar appreciation based on one of the models we maintain at the federal reserve', 'the estimated passthrough from import prices to consumer price inflation occurs relatively quickly with effects becoming evident within a quarter and the bulk of the overall effect occurring within one year', 'by contrast the portion of the dollar effects on inflation that work through the channel of overall economic activity occurs with considerable lags', 'in the model shown here the appreciation has its largest effect on gross domestic product gdp growth in the second year after the shock', 'thus it is plausible to think that the rise in the dollar over the past year would restrain growth of real gdp through  and perhaps into  as well', 'the rise in the dollar since last summer of about  percent in nominal terms with its associated declines in nonoil import prices could plausibly be holding down core inflation quite noticeably this year', 'commodity prices other than oil are also of relevance for inflation in the united states', 'prices of metals and other industrial commodities and agricultural products are affected to a considerable extent by developments outside the united states and the softness weve seen in these commodity prices has in part reflected a slowing of demand from china and elsewhere', 'these prices likely have also been a factor in holding down inflation in the united states', 'the dynamics with which all these factors affect inflation depend crucially on the behavior of inflation expectations', 'one striking feature of the economic environment is that longerterm inflation expectations in the united states appear to have remained generally stable since the late s chart', 'the source of that stability is open to debate but the fact that the fed has kept inflation relatively low and stable for three decades must be an important part of the explanation', 'expectations that are not stable but instead follow actual inflation up or down would allow inflation to drift persistently', 'in the recent period movements in inflation have tended to be transitory', 'for example one might have expected the great recession to generate a downward wageprice spiral but this did not occur', 'thus the stability of inflation expectations has prevented inflation from falling further below our objective than occurred and it has enabled the federal open market committee to look through some upward inflation shocks without compromising price stability', 'we should however be cautious in our assessment that inflation expectations are remaining stable', 'one reason is that measures of inflation compensation in the market for treasury securities have moved down somewhat since last summer chart', 'but these movements can be hard to interpret as at times they may reflect factors other than inflation expectations such as changes in demand for the unparalleled liquidity of nominal treasury securities', 'in announcing its july interest rate decision the federal open market committee fomc said in determining how long to maintain this target range the committee will assess progressboth realized and expectedtoward its objectives of maximum employment and  percent inflation', 'this assessment will take into account a wide range of information including measures of labor market conditions indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations and readings on financial and international developments', 'the committee anticipates that it will be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate when it has seen some further improvement in the labor market and is reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its  percent objective over the medium term', 'can the committee be reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its  percent objective over the medium term', 'as i have discussed given the apparent stability of inflation expectations there is good reason to believe that inflation will move higher as the forces holding down inflation dissipate further', 'while some effects of the rise in the dollar may be spread over time some of the effects on inflation are likely already starting to fade', 'the same is true for last years sharp fall in oil prices though the further declines we have seen this summer have yet to fully show through to the consumer level', 'and slack in the labor market has continued to diminish so the downward pressure on inflation from that channel should be diminishing as well', 'in addition with regard to expectations of inflation it is possible to consult the results of the sep the survey of economic projections which fomc participants complete shortly before the march june september and december meetings', 'in the june sep the central tendency of fomc participants projections for core pce inflation was . percent to . percent this year . percent to . percent next year and . percent to . percent in', 'reflecting all these factors the committee has indicated in its postmeeting statements that it expects inflation to return to  percent', 'from may through july nonfarm payroll employment gains have averaged  per month', 'we now await the results of the august employment survey which are due to be published on september', 'of course the fomcs monetary policy decision is not a mechanical one based purely on the set of numbers reported in the payroll survey and in our judgment on the degree of confidence members of the committee have about future inflation', 'we are interested also in aspects of the labor market beyond the simple u measure of unemployment including for example the rates of unemployment of older workers and of those working parttime for economic reasons we are interested also in the participation rate', 'and in the case of the inflation rate we look beyond the rate of increase of pce prices and define the concept of the core rate of inflation', 'while thinking of different aspects of unemployment we are concerned mainly with trying to find the right measure of the difficulties caused to current and potential participants in the labor force by their unemployment', 'in the case of the core rate of inflation we are mainly looking for a good indicator of future inflation and for better indicators than we have at present', 'in making our monetary policy decisions we are interested more in where the u.s. economy is heading than in knowing whence it has come', 'that is why we need to consider the overall state of the u.s. economy as well as the influence of foreign economies on the u.s. economy as we reach our judgment on whether and how to change monetary policy', 'that is why we follow economic developments in the rest of the world as well as the united states in reaching our interest rate decisions', 'the fed has appropriately responded to the weak economy and low inflation in recent years by taking a highly accommodative policy stance', 'by committing to foster the movement of inflation toward our  percent objective we are enhancing the credibility of monetary policy and supporting the continued stability of inflation expectations', 'to do what monetary policy can do towards meeting our goals of maximum employment and price stability and to ensure that these goals will continue to be met as we move ahead we will most likely need to proceed cautiously in normalizing the stance of monetary policy', 'for the purpose of meeting our goals the entire path of interest rates matters more than the particular timing of the first increase', 'with inflation low we can probably remove accommodation at a gradual pace', 'yet because monetary policy influences real activity with a substantial lag we should not wait until inflation is back to

returning to baseline which is consistent with a fourquarter decline in core pce inflation of about . percent in the first year following the shock', 'while the board staff uses a range of models to gauge the effect of shocks the model employed in figure as well as other models used by staffsuggests that the dollars large appreciation will probably depress core pce inflation between  and  percentage point this year through this import price channel', 'thus given that core pce inflation is running around  percent on a fourquarterchange basis the stronger dollar has played a material role in holding core pce inflation below  percent', 'a second channel through which dollar appreciation reduces inflation is by increasing economic slack', 'greater slack amplifies the downward pressure on inflation although the quantitative effect is probably fairly modest given the flat slope of the phillips curve', 'because the passthrough of dollar appreciation to oil and food commodity prices is much higher than for most imports dollar appreciation tends to depress overall pce inflation by even more than it depresses core inflation', 'an important difference between the transmission of dollar appreciation to inflation compared with output is that the effects on inflation are probably more transient', 'in particular given that most of the effect on inflation occurs through changes in import pricesand import prices respond quickly to the exchange ratethe peak effect on inflation probably occurs within a few quarters', 'from the standpoint of the outlook this transience means that some of the forces holding down inflation in particularly those due to a stronger dollar and lower energy priceswill begin to fade next year', 'consequently overall pce inflation is likely on this account alone to rebound next year to around  percent', 'and as long as inflation expectations remain well anchored both core and overall inflation are likely to rise gradually toward  percent over the medium term as the labor market improves further and the transitory effects of declines in energy and import prices dissipate', 'u.s. monetary policy and the dollar the stronger dollar and some of the factors causing it including weaker foreign demand have played an important role in accounting for revisions to the expected path of u.s. policy rates compared with what was expected in

indication of the extent to which forecasts for inflation output growth and the federal funds rate have changed since the summer of', 'the june  sep showed u.s. gdp growth centered at roughly  percent

below  percent at the end of  before rising to only  percent at the end of', 'this greater degree of monetary accommodation seems appropriate given the adverse effects on u.s. aggregate demand coming from the rise in the dollar an associated weakening of foreign economic prospects and other developments that have restrained spending and kept inflation undesirably low', 'monetary policy easing helps through crowding in domestic demand which in turn helps boost price inflation and makes it less likely that inflation expectations drift below our  percent target', 'the board staffs generalequilibrium models that take explicit account of the ability of monetary policy to crowd in domestic demandincluding the staffs frbus and multicountry sigma modelssuggest that monetary policy easing can substantially mitigate the effects of adverse shocks on gdp including from the recent runup in the dollar', 'in the case of the dollar shock considered previously these models suggest that the allin effects of the stronger dollar on gdp are only about onehalf to twothirds as large as implied by the trade model that abstracts from a monetary policy responsestill substantial to be sure

international monetary fund imf regional outlook for asia growth in emerging asia is set to decline in  and  with chinas growth decelerating', 'in my discussion i will first address some of the factors behind slowing growth in emerging asia importantly including demographics', 'i will then cover one of the global implications of this deceleration the effect on commodity markets before looking at the prospects for india to recharge the regions growth dynamic', 'why is growth in emerging asia slowing', 'the first thing to say and think about asian growth is that growth at a rate of above  percent is not slow it is slower than it has been but it remains impressive', 'there are four factors weighing on emerging asian growth that i would like to highlight', 'first emerging asia continues to be negatively affected by slow demand growth elsewhere including in the advanced economies', 'second economies generally decelerate as they develop a pattern that has already been evidenced in many of emerging asias growth pioneers', 'third the tremendous growth of trade in the region driven by the process of global integration and the growth of productionsharing networks may have plateaued', 'lastly demographic trends in a number of emerging asian countries are likely to affect growth in the coming years', 'regarding the first of the factors that i just listed contrary to

asias economic conditions', 'and as we all know advancedeconomy demand for imports in recent years has been lackluster', 'regarding the second factor as is well established by theory and supported by empirical experience economic growth tends to decelerate as a country develops', 'likewise the initial phase of integration with the global economy is typically marked by strong gains in productivity as methods and technologies are adopted from more advanced economies', 'over time the boost to growth from this catchup in productivity fades', 'also as incomes rise and consumption grows there is a tendency for a relatively rapid increase in demand for services', 'the shift of domestic resources toward the production of services which are typically associated with lower productivity growth tends to further lower trend growth', 'the factors that have tended to temper growth as economies develop appear to be at play in china', 'as viewed in the context of the lewis model china could be reaching the stage at which the supply of labor from the subsistence agricultural sector becomes a constraint on growth', 'further productivity growth though robust by global standards has been declining', 'this decrease is likely due at least in part to the rapid growth of services consumption', 'next i would like to discuss the third factor weighing on asian growthtrade', 'global integration and trade growth have played a key role in the asian economic success story and the recent slowdown in global trade over and above what might be expected given the weakness of advancedeconomy demand discussed earlier is likely to affect emerging asian growth prospects', 'but the bounceback was more limited than the decline with the increase in the volume of trade since  only matching the pace of global output growth a considerable deceleration from the previous two decades when trade increased at twice the pace of global output', 'after increasing at an average rate of about  percent a year through the s nominal intraasian trade flows have flattened out considerably over the past couple of years in part reflecting a slowdown in the growth of production sharing within the region', 'the growth of productionsharing networks in asia has been tied to the regions exportoriented growth model', 'in particular chinas integration into the global economy as the hub of this production network provided a significant boost to the development and growth of these networks', 'as china and the region shift toward domestic demand and away from external demand it seems unlikely that trade growth in the region will return to its earlier exceptional pace', 'to the extent that the expansion of these networks was tied to exportled growth that depended partly on preferential treatment of the export sector morebalanced growth in these economies may also result in a better allocation of production across countries', 'if growth of trade is lower as a result that is not necessarily a problem', 'however there is a wellestablished literature indicating that trade encourages greater efficiency along with the dissemination of technological innovation and slower growth of trade could reduce this effect', 'it also bears noting that asian trade growth has been accompanied by the creation of a variety of intraregional and broader trade agreementsincluding the nation asean and membership in the world trade organization which china achieved in  and vietnam in as well as a host of bilateral agreements both within and outside the region', 'finally demographics are an additional factor likely to lower growth in the region particularly in hong kong korea singapore thailand and china notwithstanding the recent relaxation of the onechild policy', 'just as slowing workforce growth is likely to be a drag on growth in many developed countries trend growth is likely to be held back by demographic developments in relatively elderly emerging asian economies as well', 'up to this point i have discussed a number of factors that are likely to lower emerging asias growth trajectory in the coming years', 'however the overall message is not a pessimistic one rather for the most part the slowing

the region will require a transition toward an economic paradigm more rooted in domestic demand particularly consumption', 'the need for these economiesprimarily china but also those economies that

bottom line that should be emphasized is that even with a diminished pace of growth the region is still expected to significantly outpace the global economy and make by far the largest contribution to global growth in the years ahead', 'specifically china with its investmentheavy growth model has accounted for a substantial amount of incremental commodity demand over the past two decades', 'since  china has accounted for roughly  percent of the increase in global demand for oil and  percent of the growth in demand for steel', 'for copper all of the incremental rise in global demand has come from china with demand excluding china falling over the period', 'the strength of emerging asian demand growth pushed commodity prices up sharply over most of the past decade at least temporarily reversing what seemed to be an inexorable decline in both commodity prices and the terms of trade of commodity producers in the preceding two decades', 'higher prices were a tremendous boon to commodity producers and supported a decade of strong growth in a number of emerging market economies as well as commodity sectors in certain advanced economies including australia and the united states', 'since mid commodity prices have plummeted with oil prices falling almost  percent and a broad index of metals prices losing about onethird of its value dragging down growth in many commodity producers', 'although rapid commodity output growth in recent years which has reflected in part the response of producers to previous price increases has certainly contributed to the fall in commodity prices the slowing of demand growth from china and emerging asia has also been an important factor', 'while the path ahead for commodity prices is as always uncertain declining investment rates in emerging asia particularly china present the prospect of a prolonged decline in the growth rate of commodity demand', 'and prices could remain low for quite some time which seems particularly true for metals such as copper and steel used heavily in construction and investment', 'however for oil the implications of a shift from investmentled growth to a consumptionled model are less certain', 'per capita oil consumption tends to increase with wealth such that further income growth in china has the potential to provide strong support for the oil market in the coming years', 'indeed more generally the world stands to benefit from a transition to more consumptionled growth in emerging asia', 'under a successful transition toward morebalanced growth emerging asia can be expected to import a broader array of goods and services both from within the region and globally', 'whether a country benefits from or is harmed by emerging asias transition is likely to be determined by the flexibility of that countrys economy in adapting to shifts in asian demand away from commodities and inputs for assembly into the regions exports and toward services and goods to meet asian final demand', 'to recap the transition to slower growth in the emerging asian economies as well as a shift toward domestic demand and consumption and away from external demand and investment in the region

least', 'many of the factors that determine r particularly productivity growth are extremely difficult to forecast', 'raising the inflation target one step that has been proposed by many including olivier blanchard is the possibility of raising the target rate of inflation from  percent to some higher level', 'one concern i have raised in the past about such proposals is that high levels of inflation may also be associated with higher inflation variability', 'the welfare costs of high and variable inflation could be substantial', 'for example more variable inflation would make longrun

money rather the quantity of money may be caused by and consistent with the inflation rate resulting from the three basic equations in which the money stock does not appearin particular from the gap between the natural and actual rates of interest', 'it provides justification for the behavior of those central banks that think and talk of monetary policy purely in terms of the policy interest rate and other financial return variables but not of the money stock', 'when he turns to optimal policy woodford starts chapter  by asking what the goals of monetary policy should be', 'he states that there is a fair amount of consensus in the literature that a desirable monetary policy is one that achieves a low expected value of an objective function that includes inflation and some measure of output relative to potential', 'he then goes on to point out the many questions such a formulation leaves unanswered including whether to target the price level or the inflation rate should greater priority be given to reducing the variability of unforecastable inflation should one seek to stabilize output deviations from a smooth trend or from the shortrun aggregate supply curve and so forth', 'this sounds simple but it is not for the explanation that woodford provides is that we have seen that models founded on individual optimization can be constructed that thanks to the presence of nominal rigidities allow for realistic effects of monetary policy upon real variables', 'here we shall see those same nominal rigidities provide welfareeconomic justification for central bankers traditional concern for price stability', 'that is not a simple thought but it is logicaland that insight enables michael to derive a utility or loss function with inflation in it', 'the importance of the longterm interest rate', 'another key result is that when you solve forward the system above you find as woodford notes p. that aggregate demand in this model depends upon all expected future short real rates and not simply upon a current ex ante short real rate of return and unless fluctuations in short rates are both highly unforecastable and highly transitory expectations of future short rates are more significant than the current short rate and in a footnote he notes that this can also be explained by saying that it is the long rate of interest and not the short rate that determines aggregate demand in this model', 'at the zlb explicit forward guidance can potentially offset a lot of the distortion by in effect reducing all interest rates across the maturity spectrum at least up to the time that policy changes', 'indeed as shown by eggertson and woodford  optimal forward guidance should commit to maintain lower interest rates during the recovery than would otherwise have been warranted by economic conditions', 'importantly the appropriate commitment can be framed as a historydependent policy function responding only to the history of the price level and the output gap in such a way that the impact on policy decisions of economic conditions at the lower bound continue even as the economy recovers', 'if such an explicit criterion made it clear that shortterm interest rates will not immediately be increased as soon as a taylor rule descriptive of past behavior would justify a funds rate above  basis points this would provide a reason for market participants to expect easier future monetary and financial conditions than they may currently be anticipating', 'but the puzzle is not a deep one for the ability of any central bank to commit to follow a particular monetary policy rule must be a diminishing function of the length of the horizon that is being considered', 'this high elasticity is also in evidence in attempts to evaluate alternative monetary policy regimes', 'he argues that portfolio balance effects do not exist in a modern generalequilibrium theory of asset prices and that it does not matter whether a particular risk is held in the portfolio of private investors or the central bank for in the end the gains or losses of the central bank are transferred to the government and via the government budget constraint are returned to private individuals', 'money supply versus interest rate', 'at present the neowicksellian approach developed by woodford and others is dominant relative to the explicitly monetary approach to monetary policy used by patinkin and others', 'but i believe that we need to consider both approaches to monetary policy for monetary policy affects the economy not only through the euler equation as in woodford but also through direct effects on current demands for goods described by patinkins use of the realbalance effect and by wicksells explanation of price dynamics described earlier', 'the fundamental impact of michael woodford on fed thinking  the most direct impact of woodford on fed thinking and analysis comes from his neowicksellian analysis of monetary policy', 'essentially woodford has developed the links between fluctuations of output and inflation around their natural  or longrun equilibrium values and economic welfarea point  made clear by the discussion above of his analysis of the optimal goals of monetary policy', 'as a result these models are now routinely used in monetary policy discussions', 'while estimates of the natural rate from dsge models provide some information needed for the proper conduct of monetary policy these estimates are closely tied to the structure of the dsge models and essentially ignore the possibility of longterm structural changes in the balance between saving and investment', 'a priority for researchers in the field is to develop improved estimates of the longrun equilibrium interest rate and to develop policies that can influence it', 'in that regard one should recognize that in a more complete model than the basic three equation model laid out above the natural and longrun equilibrium interest rates would be functions of many variables among them fiscal variableswith respect to both infrastructure spending and taxation', 'in particular faster trend growth would increase the longrun equilibrium interest rate and what we need most now that we are near full employment and approaching our target inflation rate is faster potential growth']"

low level of the natural rate of interest', 'if we knew the natural rate precisely conducting monetary policy would be relatively straightforward', 'central bankers could easily assess their policy stancewhich could be measured for instance as the difference between actual and natural interest ratesand adjust it as needed', 'in reality given that the natural rate of interest cannot be directly observed wicksell proposed that the central bank follow a simple interest rate rule', 'given that he believed that the sole function of monetary policy should be to pursue price stability a modern interpretation of wicksells rule would suggest that the central bank should raise the interest rate if inflation is above target and reduce the interest rate if inflation is below target', 'when inflation stabilized the central bank would know that the interest rate was at its natural level', 'in principle this method could be extended to a reaction function that included both an inflation and a maximumemployment objective for the central bank as is the case for the federal reserve', 'laubach and williams estimated the natural rate in a smallscale keynesian model where inflation responds to the gap between actual and potential gross domestic product gdp and economic activity is determined by a simple equation that links deviations of actual from potential gdp to the gap between actual and natural interest rates', 'in their model as in wicksells framework inflation generally will rise if the interest rate is low relative to the natural rate and fall if the interest rate is high relative to the natural rate', 'their empirical results point to the growth rate of potential gdp as an important determinant of the natural rate of interest a topic that i will discuss shortly', 'their resultssummarized in figure  support the informal assessment that chronically low interest rates could well be at least in part the result of very low natural interest rates and not just a consequence of the cyclical state of the economy', 'we should be concerned because a low natural interest rate can have major economic significance', 'second there is an effective lower bound for nominal interest rates and consequently for the actual real rate', 'because currency is a government obligation that pays a nominal interest rate of zero and instead of buying government bills or bonds at a negative interest rate one can always hold currency', 'in john maynard keyness general theory this contrast between equilibrium and actual interest rates was at the heart of the socalled liquidity trap a situation where the equilibrium interest rate is so low that even a zero or slightly negative nominal interest rate is not low enough to stimulate economic activity', 'keyness bottom line was that when the economy falls into the liquidity trap traditional monetary policy loses its effectiveness and fiscal policy has to be used for countercyclical stabilization', 'and here lies the first reason why we should be concerned about chronically low interest rates when the equilibrium interest rate is very low the economy is more likely to fall into the liquidity trap it becomes more vulnerable to adverse shocks that might render conventional monetary policy ineffective', 'of course as we have all learned over the past several years unconventional monetary policy tools developed and used since the great recessionsuch as largescale asset purchases and extended forward guidancehave significantly mitigated concerns about the liquidity trap', 'nonetheless the question of whether unconventional tools are perfect substitutes for cutting shortterm interest rates remains a topic of active research', 'let me briefly mention a second reason for worrying about ultralow interest rates the transition to a world with a very low natural rate of interest may hurt financial stability by causing investors to reach for yield and some financial institutions will find it harder to be profitable', 'on the whole however the evidence to date does not point to notable risks to financial stability stemming from ultralow interest rates', 'for instance economic theoryalong with some empirical evidencesuggests that real interest rates and the growth of real gdp tend to move together over the long run', 'thus a decline in longerrun equilibrium real ratesas suggested by my observations today and by the careful work of laubach and williamscould be yet another indication that the economys growth potential may have dimmed considerably', 'this deeply concerning conjecturewhich suggests that the slowdown of productivity growth that we have experienced in recent years could be long lastinghas played an important role in larry summerss revival of the secular stagnation hypothesis', 'ultimately the level of the natural interest rate reflects businesses households and governments saving and investment decisions over the medium to longer run', 'indeed the savinginvestment channel provides a useful framework for thinking about the relationship between the natural rate and the growth rate of potential gdp', 'for instance a lasting slowing in the pace of technological innovationa key determinant of potential growthmay result in fewer profitable opportunities for businesses which could dampen their propensity to invest in physical capital', 'if persistent this slowing in the growth rate of potential gdpand the resulting combination of lower investment and higher saving propensitieswould put downward pressure on the natural rate of interest', 'some of these trends may have worked more directly on the demand for investment goods whereas others may have had a more direct bearing on saving', 'on the saving side some researchers have noted that high saving rates in some emerging market countries combined with a lack of suitable domestic investment opportunities in those countries may have put downward pressure on interest rates in advanced economies', 'others have raised the possibility that the trauma associated with the great recession may have contributed to a persistent increase in precautionary saving and greater demand for safe and liquid assets', 'if some of the forces behind these shifts prove to be quite persistent then we could be stuck in a new longerrun equilibrium characterized by sluggish growth and recurrent reliance on unconventional monetary policy', 'monetary and fiscal policies could ameliorate some though not all of the potential causes of ultralow ratessuch as excessive precautionary saving and weak demand for physical capital', 'in other words ultralow interest rates are not necessarily here to stay especially if the right policies are put in place to address at least some of their root causes', 'without them we probably would have had a more pronounced increase in precautionary saving and a deeper decline in fixed investment which together would have put additional downward pressure on the natural rate of interest and more important further damaged the economys growth potential', 'but second the virtues of sound monetary policy notwithstanding we must not forget as former fed chairman ben bernanke reminded us on numerous occasions that monetary policy is not a panacea', 'for instance as i mentioned recently elsewhere policies to boost productivity growth and the longerrun potential of the economy are more likely to be found in effective fiscal and regulatory measures than in central bank actions', 'some combination of improved public infrastructure better

is poor all of us should be very concerned foras we all knoweconomic growth lies at the heart of our nations and the worlds future prosperity', 'a second concern is that low interest rates make the

developments through both trade and financial channels', 'given that about oneeighth of the goods and services produced in the united states are exported a sizable component of u.s. aggregate demand depends on foreign consumption and investment decisions and hence ultimately on the economic health of foreign economies', 'the high degree of interconnectedness between domestic and foreign financial intermediariesbanks the nonbank financial sector and insurers among othersmeans that developments in foreign financial markets tend to reverberate quickly back to the united states including through changes in asset prices and risk tolerance', 'although financial conditions have improved markedly in the advanced foreign economies and their monetary policy has been highly accommodative these economies have yet to break out from the tepid growth they have experienced since the global financial crisis', 'growth in the emerging market economies has also been disappointingly slow', 'for example gross domestic product gdp growth in latin america declined to zero last year far below the  to  percent growth rates achieved in the first few years of this decade', 'the emerging market economies emes have weathered several bouts of financial market turbulence including earlier this year due to market concerns about economic growth in china and about its exchange rate system', 'with foreign growth relatively weak the prospect of a gradual normalization of u.s. monetary policy contributed to a large appreciation of the dollar since mid with the real effective exchange value of the dollar rising around  percent', 'these global developments materially slowed progress toward the federal reserves employment and inflation objectives', 'the sizable appreciation of the dollar has been a substantial drag on u.s. exports over the past two years and hence subtracted from economic growth', 'the stronger dollar in concert with lower oil and other commodity prices has also markedly reduced import price inflation and has been a factor keeping inflation well below the federal open market committees fomc  percent goal', 'these developments have influenced the fomcs decisions to maintain a very accommodative monetary policy longer than members of the fomc had expected in  and through the end of', 'i am cautiously optimistic that the drag on the u.s. economy and inflation from past dollar appreciation may have mostly worked itself out and that foreign economies are on a somewhat more secure footing that poses smaller downside risks to the u.s. economy', 'it is also possible that foreign economies may outperform forecasts which would provide a boost to u.s. employment prospects and also to inflation', 'while forecasts are inherently uncertain we will as always pay close attention to foreign developments given their significant consequences for the u.s. economy and take such developments into account in determining the appropriate stance of u.s. monetary policy', 'key channels through which u.s. monetary policy affects foreign economies i have focused thus far on the effects of global developments on the u.s. economy and financial markets and argued that these developments may have an important influence on u.s. monetary policy actions', 'i will next consider how u.s. monetary policy actions tend to affect foreign economies', 'foreign economies were affected when the fed engaged in unconventional monetary policy stimulus and will likely experience some effects of the feds ongoing normalization of policy', 'the federal reserves focus on supporting domestic objectives for inflation and employment has sometimes been criticized as having potentially undesirable effects on the global economy', 'it is indeed likely that the depreciation of the dollar that accompanied u.s. asset purchases and forward guidance reduced foreign net exports and thus weighed on foreign gdp through the exchange rate channel', 'however our accommodative policies also increased u.s. domestic demand a second key channel of transmission that operated to boost the net exports of our foreign trading partners', 'moreover insofar as our unconventional policies reduced global interest rates and boosted asset pricesa third channel that tended to expand foreign as well as domestic demandthese actions were probably mildly stimulative for the global economy', 'while foreign exports are hurt due to the implied appreciation of foreign currenciesreducing foreign gdp about . percent according to their estimatesforeign exports are boosted by nearly the same amount due to the policyinduced expansion of u.s. domestic demand', 'however given that the fall in u.s. interest rates tends to reduce foreign interest ratesat least on averageby around half as much my colleagues concluded that u.s. monetary stimulus likely has noticeable positive spillovers to foreign economies', 'economies with more open capital accounts and that keep their exchange rate relatively stable against the dollar experience larger positive effects on their gdp of an expansionary fed monetary policy action', 'the larger positive spillovers reflect the fact that their own interest rates move more in lockstep with u.s. interest rates while the effects on their traded goods sector from the exchange rate channel are smaller', 'for example hong kong which has pegged its currency to the u.s. dollar at a fixed exchange rate since  is an extreme illustration of an economy in which fed actions pass through almost one to one to domestic interest rates', 'conversely spillovers from u.s. policy actions tend to be smaller to economies that have flexible exchange rates and adjust their policy rates based on domestic conditions or alternatively to economies with less open capital accounts such as china', 'most of the advanced foreign economies eventually welcomed the positive spillovers to their domestic output that were due to u.s. unconventional monetary policy easing', 'because these economies generally experienced slower recoveries than the united states as well as undesirably low inflation their central banks also wanted to pursue highly accommodative policies and took complementary actionsincluding forward guidance and largescale asset purchasesto spur economic recovery', 'output in many emes expanded rapidly during the recovery from the global financial crisis fueled by strong capital inflows and a boom in oil and commodity prices', 'given that the feds easing raised equity prices and strengthened the demand for risky assets around the globe it probably contributed to the growing resource pressures in some of these economies', 'emes had to choose between an accommodative monetary policy that was more in line with the united states and other advanced economies versus a tighter policy stance likely to cause their exchange rates to appreciate markedly and possibly cause a relatively sharp contraction in the tradable sectors of their economies', 'while the more accommodative stance had the attractive feature that it would lessen the hurt to the export sector the downside was that it was more likely to lead to overheating and high inflation that could be costly to correct', 'my sense is that most eme central banks had considerable latitude to keep inflation near target and output near potential through maintaining a relatively tight policy and thus to limit spillovers from easing by the advanced economies', 'but while i think that there is a strong case for focusing on a limited set of objectives including to ensure that inflation expectations remain firmly anchored it is also important to recognize the tough tradeoffs faced by eme central banks given their understandable desire to avoid causing a sharp slowdown in exports', 'the tradeoff faced by eme central bankers helps illustrate some of the challenges posed by monetary policy divergence between the united states and other economies closely tied to it through economic and financial channels', 'moreover the feds monetary policy actions were reinforced by many steps to help safeguard the u.s. financial system and increase its resilience to shocks', 'u.s. monetary policy going forward prospective divergence policy divergence remains a familiar theme today but the focus has obviously shifted to the consequences of a tightening in u.s. monetary policy on the rest of the global economy', 'in my view the fed appears reasonably close to achieving both the inflation and employment components of its mandate', 'accordingly the case for removing accommodation gradually is quite strong keeping in mind that the future is uncertain and that monetary policy is not on a preset course', 'indeed the large rise in u.s. bond yields during this episode precipitated a nearly commensurate rise in interest rates in many foreign economies and caused the prices of risky assets to fall globally', 'emes with weak fundamentals experienced sharp capital outflows an abrupt tightening of financial conditions and large exchange rate depreciations', 'while there will almost inevitably be some bumps along the road there are a number of reasons why i think that that policy normalization will not cause sizable disruptions for our trading partners first the fed will remove accommodation only in response to an outlook for improving economic conditions and firming inflation', 'for example the bank of englands threshold strategy announced in the summer of promising to keep policy rates extraordinarily low at least until unemployment fell below  percentlowered the expected path of policy rates significantly by pushing back expectations of liftoff', 'india was dubbed one of the fragile five economies during the taper tantrum and during that episode experienced large capital outflows a spike in borrowing costs and sizable exchange rate depreciation', 'since that time india has markedly improved its macroeconomic framework cutting its inflation rate by half to around  percent anchoring inflation expectations more securely and reducing what had been large and persistent fiscal and current account deficits', 'somewhat more generally the improved macroeconomic frameworks in many emes achieved over the past couple of decadeswith inflation targeting often playing a key rolehas enabled these economies to pursue countercyclical policies to a much greater degree than in the past and should help insulate them from monetary policy spillovers', 'the low longrun level of the policy rate reflects a number of factorsincluding slower productivity growth demographic change and a higher demand for safe assetsthat have pushed down the real longrun neutral rate which is the real interest rate needed to keep the economy at full employment in the longerrun', 'while there are good grounds to expect that spillovers from u.s. monetary policy actions will be manageable for most of our trading partners events may unfold differently than expected', 'to illustrate a noticeably faster u.s. recovery would require a more rapid removal of u.s. accommodation and could exert noticeably larger spillovers abroad by putting more upward pressure on foreign interest rates and by inducing larger depreciations of foreign currencies', 'despite greater policy divergence many of our trading partners would receive a net boost to their gdp provided that the stimulus to their exportsfrom stronger u.s. demand and a weaker domestic currencywas sufficient to offset possible tightening in their financial conditions', 'but other economies might be hurt as a weaker currency could lead to balance sheet deterioration and rising risk spreads especially if their central banks were called on to tighten monetary policy to keep inflation at bay', 'while such uncertainty is a constant feature of the landscape we confront as policymakers both the u.s. and global economies will be served best if we keep our own houses in order and ensure that policy rates are adjusted as appropriate to achieve our inflation and employment objectives', 'international spillovers of monetary policy ifdp notes', 'monetary policy in emerging

economic activity only through its influence over the general level of interest rates', 'our definitions were as follows a central bank has goal independence when it is free to set the final goals of monetary policy', 'under the new law the bank of englands monetary policy committee mpc rather than the treasury set the policy interest rate', 'inflation targeting which began in the united kingdom in  continued under the new system and was codified in the bank of england act of', 'the mpc was given an explicit numerical inflation target corresponding to effective price stability alongside an implied stabilization goal for real economic activity', 'today both the fomc and the mpc have a numerical inflation goal percent', 'in the united kingdom the chancellor of the exchequer sets the mpcs inflation target currently  percent per year for the u.k. consumer price index', 'in the united states in the fomcs statement on longerrun goals and monetary policy strategy first issued in  and discussed annually committee participants have judged that the longerrun inflation objective that corresponds to the federal reserves mandate is a rate of  percent per year as measured by the change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures', 'but there is a subtle difference between them in terms of who sets the inflation target', 'to date that difference has not generated any major divergence between the approaches to monetary policy of the two central banks', 'the goals of monetary policy should be set by the central government as is the case in both the united states and the united kingdom', 'we all know what the goals of the bank of england and the fed are for both the goals are stability of the price level and full employment', 'although there is a hint of a lexicographic ordering in favor of the rate of inflation in the bank of englands mandate the federal reserves dual mandate unambiguously places equal weight on both goals', 'across the world there seems to be a preference for inflation either to be the only goal variable or to be lexicographically emphasized over unemployment', 'there is no central bank thatin mervyn kings terminologyis an inflation nutter', 'instrument independence is necessary because without it the central bank is unable to set the stance of monetary policy that it believes to be most consistent with achievement of the statutory mandate', 'for example in a country that has committed its central bank to enforce an exchange rate band with the exchange rate free to move within the band the central bank will not be fully instrument independent though it may have a substantial amount of independence with respect to the precise settings of the policy interest rate and other monetary tools', 'however these bankssuch as those in sweden and the united kingdomwere later sometimes given their operational independence in part to create a greater separation of monetary policy from fiscal policyin particular in order to ensure that they would not be vulnerable to pressure to finance the government budget that is to monetize public spending', 'around the world the fear of the central bank losing its ability to meet its price stability goal may well have been the prime reason for governments to implement instrument independence', 'fundamentally however central bank instrument independence is desirable because monetary policy is an esoteric and complicated art or science involving technical judgments that have economywide and often longlasting consequences a separate institution is needed to manage and take responsibility for monetary policy', 'that is both the central government and the general public should be confident that their central bank can be relied on to deliver a stable price level and close to full employment along with financial stability', 'these were points the fomc recognized in its statement on longerrun goals and monetary policy strategy which observed that

economic implications of developments like brexit', 'the content reflects the banks change in focusfrom markets in the preinflationtargeting era to macroeconomic implications of financial and other developments', 'and an innovation of mervyn king in the early years of inflation targeting that has continued in the era of independence is the inflation report press conference', 'new monetary policy tools the mpc and fomc have extensivelyparticularly in recent yearsused two monetary policy tools other than decisions on the current shortterm interest rate', 'by  however there was widespread recognition of the merits of clarity on the reaction function and of having longterm interest rates incorporate accurate expectations of future policy', 'these considerations led to the fomcs use of forward guidance regarding the shortterm interest rate in its postmeeting statements during the mids', 'through forward guidance additional accommodation from shortterm interest rate policy could be provided by lengthening the period over which the policy rate was expected to remain at its lower bound', 'in addition the sep shows individual fomc participants expectations regarding the policy rate though it does not identify the individuals in the interest rate dot plot', 'as the policy ratebank rateis still at its lower bound in the united kingdom it remains to be seen whether mpc forward guidance will continue during policy firming', 'i expect that the bank of england will also likely continue to use forward guidance when it begins to raise the policy interest rate above its effective lower bound', 'in the early postworld war ii decades both u.k. and u.s. authorities sporadically attempted to influence longterm interest rates directly by transacting in longerterm treasury securities', 'by  however monetary policy operations in longerterm securities markets had fallen into disuse', 'the financial crisis changed matters with both countries central banks expanding their balance sheets through largescale purchases of longerdated securities to put downward pressure on longerterm interest rates and set in motion movements in asset prices and borrowing costs that would stimulate spending by households and businesses', 'this experience raises the question of whether the balance sheet will continue to be a routine tool of monetary policy once interest rates normalize', 'the fomc has indicated its preference that barring large adverse shocks to the economy adjustments to the federal funds rate will be the main means of altering the stance of monetary policy', 'the financial crisis and recession confirmed the value of central bank tools that affect the financial system beyond those most associated with monetary policy', 'the lender of last resort is also a less impersonal and more allocative device than aggregate monetary policy tools because it involves direct lending by the central bank instead of an attempt by monetary policy to alter the overall cost of privatesector borrowing', 'for these reasons the lenderoflastresort function is bound to be more rule driven than interest rate policy and it is inevitably associated with collateral arrangements and other safeguards to protect against losses and with strict eligibility criteria', 'in both countries it remains the case that not all financial stability responsibilities rest with the central bankso it is less independent in this area than in monetary policy properand the central banks tools for achieving financial stability are still being refined', 'second aggregate monetary policy toolstypically one is talking of the policy interest rateare often blunt weapons against financial imbalances so deploying them might produce a conflict between financial stability and shortterm economic stabilization', 'third financial policy might need less frequent adjustment than monetary policy', 'the lower frequency of meetings may also reflect the desirability of a relatively stable regulatory structure financial tools likely should not be as continuously data dependent as monetary policy tools', 'but the case for monetary policy independence set out in the s remains sound and monetary policy independence is now widely accepted in the united kingdom as it long has been in the united states', 'it is also clear that central bank responsibilities other than policy rate

price indexes are constructed in broadly similar ways but there are important differences between them', 'both indexes measure inflation using a specific basket of goods and services consumed by households', 'now lets talk in more detail about the differences between the cpi and the pce price indexes', 'first the pce price index has a broader scope than the cpi', 'the cpi is limited to expenditures that households pay out of pocket while the pce price index covers a broader set of goods and services as it seeks to cover prices for all consumer expenditures in the national income and product accounts nipa', 'for example the pce price index includes prices of the health services provided to households through medicaid while the cpi excludes these items', 'second the pce price index and the cpi use different weighting systems', 'the pce price index which is more comprehensive than the cpi estimates expenditure shares using the national income and product accounts while the cpi measures expenditure shares using a separate survey of households the consumer expenditure survey', 'for example the share of medical services is notably higher in the pce price index partly because the pce price index includes more kinds of medical expenditures and the share of housing services is noticeably smaller because overall expenditures are larger in the pce price index', 'as a result when healthcare services or housing services inflation behave differently than other prices this can lead to differences in pce versus cpi inflation', 'another difference in the weights is that the pce price index uses timevarying weights while the official cpi keeps weights fixed for a year', 'the pce price index weights change to reflect changes in the goods consumers buy', 'suppose the price of apples goes up and the price of oranges stays the same', 'the substitution effects captured by the pce price index is one reason why pce inflation black line is almost always lower than cpi inflation red line as you can see in figure', 'as i mentioned earlier there are both total and core pce price and cpi indexes', 'the core subindex is the total index excluding food and energy prices', 'food and energy prices are more volatile than other prices which makes total inflation more volatile', 'you can see the black line total pce price index exhibiting more drastic ups and downs than core pce price index the red line in the graph and many of the sharp movements are short lived', 'in other words the volatility in the total pce price index makes it harder to discern trends longerlasting movements from transitory movements', 'in addition food and energy prices often depend on factors that are beyond the influence of monetary policy such as geopolitical developments for example those associated with fluctuations in energy prices or weather or disease or war for example in the case of food prices', 'in summary the differences between cpi and pce price indexes are important', 'the fomc has chosen to target the pce price index because it is broader and it captures more accurately what households are actually consuming', 'in addition food and energy account for a significant portion of household budgets so the federal reserves inflation objective is defined in terms of the total pce price index but the fed monitors the core pce price index as well as other inflation indicators in order to identify evolving inflation trends', 'select components of core pce inflation now i would like to dig a bit deeper into recent inflation trends', 'to do so i find it

stationary bicycles to make our stayathome experience more pleasant', 'the imbalance between supply and demand for goods resulted in a sharp increase of prices', 'at the end of  once vaccines were

about the likely future course of prices', 'if the prospect of high inflation or uncertainty about future inflation factors heavily into firms and households calculations it is less likely that resources will be allocated to activities that raise the productive potential of the economy rather than into areas that are only made attractive by the presence of high and variable inflation', 'there are other economic costs of high inflation', 'in the labor market as nominal wages are often set in advance bouts of unanticipated inflation typically lead to a drop in workers real wages in the short run and this is a burden on households in meeting their expenses', 'more generally even anticipated rates of inflation can produce redistributions of income', 'such redistributions are also likely to be adverse for members of society who do not have ready access to the kinds of financial instruments that would best protect them against high inflation', 'the likelihood of wideranging distortions due to inflation is enhanced by the fact that the u.s. tax code does not fully take inflation into account', 'consequently as stressed in fundamental work by the late martin feldstein of harvard university high inflation can distort saving and investment decisions including through the treatment of aftertax capital gains', 'another reason why deviations from price stability distort decisions and redistribute income lies in the fact that much of our financial system including many arrangements pertaining to retirement plans is structured in terms of streams of nominal payments', 'absent a background of a steady and predictable inflation rate the purchasing power of retirement income streams and other payments may turn out to be very different from what was envisioned when they were originally arranged', 'the fact that much of the financial system is based on nominal payments also makes it clear that unexpectedly or unduly low inflation rates have important economic costs too including by saddling borrowers debtors with very high repayment burdens in real terms', 'this increase in the real value of debts due to very low inflation or worse outright deflation would also be a burden on all households that have outstanding fixed nominal student loans auto loans or credit card debt as well as businesses that had taken out bank loans or issued bonds', 'in  the fomc set a formal inflation target to help households and businesses understand our goal and help keep inflation expectations anchored over time', 'the fomcs choice of a  percent inflation rate instead of zero reflected the judgment that reasonable price stability was desirable while also recognizing the reality that very low inflation can also be economically costly', 'in addition a zero percent goal would make the longerrun nominal interest rate  percentage points lower than would be the case under a  percent inflation goal', 'a zeroinflation environment would consequently restrict the fomcs scope to lower nominal interest rates when this was necessary for stabilization purposes', 'in contrast a  percent inflation rate is still low enough to be consistent with price stability but gives the fomc greater scope to stimulate the economy in times when it judges that achievement of maximum employment requires that the committee provide policy accommodation', 'from these considerations flows the conclusion that a  percent inflation rate is the pricestability objective most consistent with the fomcs dual mandate', 'the  percent longerrun inflation goal has been maintained since', 'policy risks and the benefits of credibility often the fomc must balance competing risks given its dual mandate of promoting maximum employment and stable prices', 'in the current context there is on the one hand the risk that monetary policy will not be sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation back to  percent over time and on the other hand there is a risk of policy being too restrictive and unnecessarily increasing the likelihood of recession', 'in the face of this latter risk some economists argue that a higher inflation target is better than the feds current  percent target rate',

encouraged by the overall progress and trajectory', 'recent data on the economy and inflation also give me cautious optimism that we are on track and making continued headway toward the federal open market committees fomc inflation goal of  percent', 'that progress may have paused in the first three months of the year but information since then on economic activity the labor market and inflation points to renewed progress', 'over the last year through april personal consumption expenditures pce inflation was . percent down from . percent at its peak in', 'core pce inflationwhich excludes the volatile food and energy categorieswas . percent through april down from its peak of . percent', 'based on consumer and producer price inflation for may released last week i estimate that month pce inflation in may was a bit lower than in april', 'i was encouraged by some of the details of the recent reports particularly the continued improvement in marketbased services inflation which is based on observation of actual market prices rather than imputed values', 'thats important because marketbased prices are likely to be a better indication of the overall trend for core services inflation than nonmarket prices', 'housing services inflation meanwhile continues to be persistent', 'market rents for new tenant leases have already cooled significantly but further progress in overall housing services inflation will rely on the ongoing passthrough of the previous market rents deceleration to the rents of existing tenants with expiring leases', 'so inflation is still too high and further progress is likely to be gradual', 'however there are several reasons why i remain optimistic that improving supply and cooling demand will support continued disinflation', 'the first reason i am optimistic about further progress on inflation has to do with declining price increases and even declining prices as consumers become more price sensitive', 'as i have discussed in previous speeches reduced frequency of price adjustments helps moderate prices', 'and the frequency with which firms adjust prices which accelerated to less than every five months in early  moved closer to every seven months as of the end of', 'price adjustment frequency picked up some early this year along with the temporary firming of inflation but the general trend has been consistent with ongoing disinflation', 'an additional basis for pricesetting optimism is the fact that longerrun inflation expectations have remained well anchored', 'research by the richmond fed has found that pricesetting decisions by firms are related to their own expectations about the path of overall inflation so anchored inflation expectations among firms are likely to result in price setting consistent with those lower price expectations', 'in addition there may still be room for markups of prices over labor costs to continue falling', 'while markups are famously difficult to measure rough simple estimates of markups of prices over labor costs have fallen back from high levels but still remain above their prepandemic trend especially in the goods sector', 'a return of markups to this trend could help ongoing progress toward  percent inflation', 'a final factor for optimism about positive pricesetting developments is the range of anecdotes from firms themselves', 'the most recent edition of the feds beige book suggests firms are increasingly attentive to consumers pushing back against additional price increases and that these businesses expect to increase prices only moderately in the near term', 'beyond the beige book i have gleaned from recent earnings reports by publicly traded companies that lowerincome consumers are pulling back from their purchasing and that firms are responding by moderating price increases or in some cases actually cutting prices', 'and some large retailers have publicly spoken about cutting prices in the face of resistant consumers', 'these various indicatorsmarkups price adjustment frequency inflation expectations and anecdotes from a range of sourcessuggest that on balance pricesetting behavior is likely to continue to move closer to consistency with the fomcs inflation target', 'a second reason for my optimism about continued disinflation is slower growth in the costs faced by businesses', 'nominal wage growth has continued to trend down consistent with a labor market where supply and demand are coming into better balance', 'of course as a general matter i want to see americans experiencing strong wage growth but for that wage growth to be sustainable it must be consistent with our inflation target', 'notably as inflation has come down real wages have been rising and now exceed prepandemic levels which means that the purchasing power of workers has also been increasing', 'but at the same time we have seen slowing growth in nominal labor costs', 'the latest readings compare with an average of around  percent a year before the pandemic when inflation was running below our  percent goal', 'if this moderation in wage growth continues it will soon be at levels consistent with price stability', 'and i note that the marketbased services inflation measure i mentioned earlier tends to move closely with wage growth', 'but most other indicators point to a slow but steady easing of the labor market supported by cooling demand for hiring as well as strong supply', 'in terms of demand both the job openings rate and the hiring rate have come down from their highs of late  and early', 'surveys of business hiring intentions likewise suggest cooler demand for workers', 'on the supply side we have seen notable growth in labor supply over the past year', 'and the strong inflows of immigrants i have discussed in previous speeches

market tightness have continued to ease', 'the unemployment rate has been gradually rising and reached  percent in may still very low in historical terms and the th straight month at  percent or lower', 'we policymakers like to make our judgments based on a preponderance of the data and a preponderance of the labor market data indicates that labor market supply and demand are coming into better balance', 'a third reason for my optimism about achieving  percent inflation is that i am also cautiously optimistic about productivity growth which is a source of supply expansion that is likely to put downward pressure on inflation without slower economic growth', 'economic research finds that while many new and young firms struggle to survive a small subset of new firms are highly productive and grow rapidly eventually making significant contributions to aggregate productivity', 'some recent history favors a payoff to productivity growth from this surge in entrepreneurship', 'before the jump in productivity growth in the late s through the early s there was a similar wave of strong business entries in hightech industries', 'i suspect that most of the productivity benefits of the recent entry surge are still ahead of us', 'another basis for productivity optimism is the prospect for widespread implementation of artificial intelligence ai in its various forms', 'of course many technologies can take a long time to show through to aggregate productivity', 'only time will tell of course but the prospect of higher productivity growth raises the possibility that inflation can fall without a significant slowdown in economic activity and employment', 'my fourth and final reason for optimism on inflation is that i believe the current stance of monetary policy is sufficiently restrictive to help cool the economy and bring inflation back toward  percent without a sharp contraction in economic activity or a significant deterioration of the labor market', 'interest rates remain elevated relative to a year ago and certainly relative to two or three years ago and are restricting economic activity', 'of course some aspects of financial conditions such as house prices and especially stock prices remain robust and credit is still generally available though high interest rates make borrowing expensive', 'but the overall restrictiveness of financial conditions is apparent in interest ratesensitive sectors', 'for example the level of residential investment in the first quarterthough showing some modest improvement relative to last years pacewas still roughly  percent below its peak in . business investment in equipment contracted a bit in  and showed only tepid growth in the first quarter of this year', 'and while consumption growth has been resilient over the past couple of years fueled in part by excess savings accumulated during the pandemic and solid real wages that now exceed prepandemic levels it slowed noticeably in the first quarter especially for spending on goods', 'indeed high interest rates have left a mark on consumer assessments of buying conditions for motor vehicles and other large durable goods which often have to be financed', 'as i discussed earlier the labor market has cooled gradually and looking ahead i expect some cooling of economic activity to continue', 'on the inflation side the resurgence of import prices at the beginning of the year is concerning even if import prices came down some last month and could anticipate greater pressure on goods prices in the coming months', 'goods prices have been a key source of disinflation over the past year or so as supply chains have healed', 'while supply chains appear to have been fairly resilient to a series of shocks since the end of last yearincluding attacks on shipping in the red sea and low water levels in the panama canalgeopolitical developments in ukraine and the middle east still could lead to a sharp rise in global energy and food prices and disrupt global supply chains', 'output growth appears to have slowed in the first half of this year and while consumer spending still grew in the first quarter the may retail sales report we received this morning may be another signal that the longexpected deceleration in consumer spending may finally be upon us', 'after a considerable decline in job vacancies firms facing decreasing demand might increasingly resort to laying off workers', 'while growth in some countriesnotably in europeappears to be picking up from a soft patch last year that pickup remains tentative',

slowly', 'we need to see more progress toward  percent inflation before i will have confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward that objective', 'let me conclude by acknowledging that the surge in inflation over the past few years means that prices are now significantly higher than they were just a few years ago even as the rate of price increases has slowed dramatically since mid',

inflation across the world has been food and energy prices', 'as you know most of the time variations in inflation are heavily influenced by food and energy prices which tend to be more volatile than the prices for other goods and services', 'because many food and energy commodities are traded internationally retail prices paid by consumers also tend to have some degree of global synchronization',

notion that accommodating permanently higher inflation could purchase permanently higher employment', 'other policymakers misperceived the level of the natural rate of unemployment which we now believe had shifted up markedly in the s', 'with the higher natural rate the labor market was much tighter and provided much greater upward pressure on inflation than policymakers realized in real

upward blips in inflation will result in ongoing higher inflation they will build that view into wage and price decisions', 'in this case peoples expectations become a force adding momentum to inflation and breaking inflations momentum can require convincing people to change their minds and behaviornever an easy task', 'arguably this is why a federal funds rate near  percentroughly  percent

unanchored', 'first is the risk that inflation expectations might lose their anchor', 'we attribute a great deal of the stability of inflation in recent years to the anchoring of longerterm inflation expectations', 'the financial marketbased measures include both an expectations component and a volatile inflation premium component so they tend to move around much more than the surveys but we see no evidence of a material change in these measures either', 'the risks to inflation expectations are of course two sided', 'until this summer inflation had remained stubbornly below  percent for several years', 'and major economies in much of the world have been struggling mainly with disinflationary forces', 'some argue the contrary casethat by only gradually removing accommodation as the unemployment rate has fallen the fomc may have fallen behind the curve thereby risking an upward drift in expectations', 'from the standpoint of contingency planning our course is clear resolutely

of the phillips curve scenario', 'as i mentioned the fomc carefully monitors a wide array of early indicators of inflation pressure to evaluate this risk', 'specifically the rise in wages is broadly consistent with observed rates of price inflation and labor productivity growth and therefore does not point to an overheating labor market', 'further higher wage growth alone need not be inflationary', 'the late s episode of low unemployment saw wages rise faster than inflation plus productivity growth without an appreciable rise in inflation', 'notice however that these measures are near levels that prevailed in the late s or early s a period when core inflation remained under  percent', 'while the late s case proves that elevated values of these tightness measures do not automatically translate into rising inflation a single episode provides only limited reassurance', 'thus the fomc takes seriously the possibility that tight markets for labor or other inputs could provide greater upward pressure on inflation than in the baseline outlook', 'our best estimates however suggest that so long as inflation expectations remain anchored a modest steepening of the phillips curve would be unlikely to cause a significant rise in inflation or demand a disruptive policy tightening', 'is the natural rate of unemployment lower than expected', 'a third riskin this

the natural rate', 'for example since the start of  the unemployment rate has fallen about  percentage point and estimates of the natural rate from four wellknown sources have fallen over that period

productivity advances than in the past', 'the more optimistic analysts argue that we may be in a productivity lull while businesses work to realize the full benefit of advances that are embedded in recent investment', 'others suggest that productivityadvancing ideas are inherently harder to find and exploit than in the past implying that slower productivity growth may be with us for the long

rose toward its estimated maximum level in order to stave off an unwelcome rise in inflation', 'the change to shortfalls clarifies that going forward employment can run at or above realtime estimates

the conduct of the feds monetary policy a topic to which i will next turn', 'with this backdrop a relevant question for monetary policymakers is what quantity of central bank reserve balances will banks likely want to hold and hence how might the lcr affect banks reserve demand and thereby the longerrun size of the feds balance sheet', 'let me emphasize that policymakers have long been aware of the potential influence that regulations may have on reserve demand and thus the longerrun size of the feds balance sheet', 'in particular in augmenting its policy normalization principles and plans the fomc stated in june  that it currently anticipates reducing the quantity of reserve balances over time to a level appreciably below that seen in recent years but larger than before the financial

for reserve balances', 'let me emphasize that this question is highly speculativewe have not decided ex ante the desired longrun size of the feds balance sheet nor as i noted earlier do we have a definitive handle on banks longrun demand for reserve balances', 'indeed the fomc has said that it expects to learn more about the underlying demand for reserves during the process of balance sheet

reserve balances that might ultimately prevail', 'the kink in each curve captures what the fomc has referred to as the point of normalization of the size of the feds balance sheetthat is the point at which the balance sheet will begin to expand again to support the underlying growth in liabilities items such as federal reserve notes in circulation', 'all else being equal greater longerrun demand for currency reserve balances or other liabilities implies an earlier timing of balance sheet normalization and a higher longerrun size of the balance sheet as illustrated by the top line', 'and the conversesmaller demand for these liabilities and a later timing of normalization illustrated by the bottom lineis also possible', 'that is quite a range of time so as the balance sheet normalization

however i will be concerned instead with still another key contribution that hayek made to economic analysis understanding the operation of the price system', 'his conclusion is that only by farreaching decentralization in a market system with competition and free pricefixing is it possible to make full use of knowledge and information', 'how does hayeks case for the price system fit in alongside the other work that williamson mentioned', 'as paul samuelsonyet another nobel prize winnerhad occasion to note the argument for the price system that hayek articulated in  was complementary with but distinct from the argument that adam smith espoused in the wealth of nations', 'hayek emphasized that the signals transmitted by the various individual prices in the economy could together serve as a useful means of guiding overall resource allocation', 'the reason is that prices convey messages to consumers and producers even when the information that drives prices is not aggregated or directly observed', 'for example a large increase or decrease in the price of gasoline conveys information that influences consumer behavior and that also affects the behavior of energy producers even when neither of these sets of market participants are aware of the precise factor initiating the price change', 'as a related matter hayek recognized that prices transmit information even in a situation in which much of that information is not explicitly disclosed by one market participant to another or even consciously articulable by any market participant at all', 'hayek believed that all of us know many things that we cannot articulate but that we nevertheless act on in practical situations and the price system can therefore aggregate and transmit that knowledge which we could not otherwise convey', 'to hayek it was totally unrealistic to expect an economy to operate efficiently if it was based on the direction of the whole economic system according to one unified plan as such a plan lacked the valuable information embedded in marketdetermined prices', 'the flip side of hayeks analysis was that while there are insurmountable obstacles to economic efficiency via a central plan an efficient economy may still be obtainable by letting the price system work', 'it is instead sufficient for the proper operation of the price mechanism that the relevant information be embodied implicitly in the economys multiplicity of prices of individual goods and factors of production', 'this information is recorded in such prices because they respond to the behavior of individual buyers and sellers in the economy', 'consequently as longtime hayek scholar gerald odriscoll has observed what particularly recommends the price system to hayek is the economy of knowledge with which it operates', 'for example hayeks analysis has proved valuable in the development of standard microeconomics since his contribution deepened economists understanding of the working of the price system and promoted further investigation of the question of how decentralized information is transmitted by markets', 'hayeks emphasis on prices as processors of information has also had applications to international trade theory', 'and in macroeconomics and monetary theory milton friedmans nobel lecture published in  cited hayeks  paper when arguing that because it disrupted the signals arising from relativeprice movements inflation both lowered the efficiency of the economy and led output to deviate from its natural or fullemployment level', 'hayek likened the price mechanism to a system of telecommunications and friedmans description of inflation as a form of static interrupting price signals was in keeping with this analogy', 'hayeks ideas on prices influenced joseph stiglitz in his analysis of markets with asymmetric information and roger myersons insights on mechanism design theory', 'on the contrary one of the reasons why the paper has been so influential is that it remains a benchmark reference for understanding the case for relying primarily on a market system based on freely determined prices for determining the production and allocation of resources', 'the paper has therefore set a high bar for preempting the price system or for other interventions in the market when economists point to cases in which market mechanisms can be improved on by regulation or other publicsector intervention or to instances in which price signals do not appear to be operating effectively they need to identify a specific market failure as the source of the inefficiency', 'essentially they need to establish instances in which the price system can be improved on as a means of processing information', 'even hayek acknowledged that the price mechanism works within an ecosystem of laws and social institutions and those may evolve in ways that interfere with the signaling of prices', 'spreads on risky privatesector debt reached very low levels and damaging spillovers to the nonfinancial sector occurred in the form of unduly high real estate prices and excessive leverage by borrowers in the housing market', 'by creating appropriate incentives and rules they should also encourage financial markets to price risk more appropriately than they did in the years leading up to the crisisfor example by reducing the danger of investor complacency regarding the riskiness of their investments and the possibility of adverse scenarios', 'if we follow hayek and regard the price system as like a telecommunications network and then apply that metaphor to the financial sector we can think of the institutional and regulatory changes to the financial system over the past decade as designed to improve the reliability and signal quality of the transmissions', 'hayeks insights about the price system depend importantly on his theory of knowledge the information that is available to us as a society is the aggregate of the highly dispersed and sometimes inarticulate knowledge possessed by each of us individually', 'thus even if some technological way to aggregate information other than through prices could be invented it would lead to less efficient

inflation rates will ease in coming quarters some measures of underlying inflation pressures are less worrisome and longerterm inflation expectations are anchored at least for now', 'first let me address the big drivers of this years price increases', 'the inflation we have experienced so far has been very unusual and largely related to supply constraints associated both with production and distribution problems related to covid and with a demand shock arising from the unprecedented and rapid reopening of the economy', 'we all saw the remarkable price increases and shortages in the used car market', 'there have been a few other very specific and identifiable supply problems that have driven some other prices to very high levelsthe semiconductor shortages that led to auto production slowdowns for example and in some cases labor shortages or restrictions related to the covid event were associated with trade disruptions', 'second if we recognize that much of the excessive inflation we are seeing this year is directly attributable to disruptions that like the covid event will end then monetary policy often can look through those types of disruptions to consider what inflation will be in the future when this episode passes', 'to get a fix on where inflation is headed it is helpful to consider measures of inflation that try to filter out the most unusual and presumably transitory price increases that may be driving headline inflation', 'the federal reserve bank of dallass trimmed mean measure of inflation systematically removes prices that are increasing or decreasing at abnormally large rates in order to get some perspective on underlying inflation pressures', 'for the  months through august the dallas trimmed mean inflation was an even  percent', 'of course while this metric may provide a better indicator of future pce personal consumption expenditures inflation i do not mean to suggest that this is necessarily a better reading on current inflationconsumers and businesses have to pay for the goods whose prices have risen sharply and those increases are being felt', 'that brings us to the third reason that i do not think the fomc is behind the curve anchored inflation expectations', 'we monitor longerterm expectations of future inflation because we believe they influence changes in actual inflation over the medium term', 'in fact our new framework recognizes that stable wellanchored inflation expectations help return inflation to  percent when it is running high as it is now as well as when it has fallen somewhat below that goal as it often does during a recession', 'so far marketbased measures of longerterm inflation expectations as well as surveys of professional forecasters have increased only moderately this year moves that more or less reversed declines in those expectations over the previous halfdozen years', 'measuring expectations is an inexact science but smoothing through the ups and downs in expectations in recent years leaves these indicators within a range that has been consistent with inflation near our  percent goal', 'going forward the question is not only whether inflation will fall in the coming months but also how far it will fall and if it will fall soon enough to avoid spurring a concerning rise in longerterm inflation expectations', 'i agree with my fomc colleagues and most private forecasters that inflation likely will decline considerably next year from its currently very elevated rate', 'for instance most of the september summary of economic projections forecasts for pce inflation in  were between . and . percent with a minimum of . percent and a maximum of . percent', 'but i see significant upside risks to my current inflation outlook', 'as noted earlier labor supply constraints are making it difficult for businesses to keep up with demand', 'this dynamic will continue to support robust wage growth putting further upward pressure on prices', 'moreover there is evidence in the past couple of months that a broader range of prices are beginning to increase at moderate rates and i am closely watching those developments', 'the fundamental dilemma that we face at the fed right now is this demand augmented by unprecedented fiscal stimulus has been outstripping a temporarily disrupted supply leading to high inflation', 'but the fundamental productive capacity of our economy as it existed just before covidand thus the ability to satisfy that demand without inflationremains largely as it was and the factors that are disrupting it appear to be transitory', 'looked at purely in that light constraining demand now to bring it into line with a transiently interrupted supply would be premature', 'given the lags with which monetary policy acts we could easily find that demand is damping just as supply is increasing leading us to undershoot our inflation targetand in the worst case we could depress the incentives for supply to return leading to an extended period of sluggish activity and unnecessarily low employment', 'indeed we are discovering that its going to take more time than we had thought for supply to return to normal and with demand already high during that time i am monitoring the extent to which it could be further boosted by the additional fiscal programs currently under discussion', 'if those dynamics should lead this transitory inflation to continue too long it could affect the planning of households and businesses and unanchor their inflation expectations', 'this could spark a wageprice spiral that would not settle down even when the logistical bottlenecks and supply chain kinks have eased', 'i am among those who see a good chance that inflation will remain above  percent next year but i am not quite ready to conclude that this transitory period is already too long', 'let me quote from the latest fomc statement raising rates will not be appropriate until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the committees assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to  percent and is on track to moderately exceed  percent for some time', 'importantly the level of uncertainty around the paths for inflation and employment are higher than normal as we navigate the unprecedented reopening of the world economy', 'therefore we will remain outcome based waiting to see further improvements in employment and the evolution of inflation pressures in coming months', 'and if the broadly held expectation that inflation will recede next year turns out to be wrong or if inflation expectations show signs of becoming unanchored to the upside i am confident that the monetary policy tools at our disposal can bring inflation down toward our  percent goal', 'i am also keenly aware however that inflation of  percent or more certainly cannot be characterized as only moderately above  percent and thus we also have to deal with the question of how high is too high', 'moreover the two questions are obviously related we can tolerate inflation of . percent as supply returns to normal without dramatically affecting inflation expectations for a much longer period than we can tolerate inflation of . percent', 'in  the fomc formally adopted a longerrun inflation target of  percent and since then that target has been reaffirmed annually by the committee including in our new framework adopted in august', 'the key innovations in the new framework relative to the previous incarnation are designed primarily to address the risk that inflation and inflation expectations could settle below our  percent target', 'that risk emanates from the understanding that several longerrun changes in the u.s. economy may have conspired to reduce the level of the equilibrium federal funds ratethe level at which it is neither slowing nor speeding up economic activity', 'in turn a lower average level of interest rates would make it more difficult on balance for the federal reserve to respond to negative shocks to the economy with sizable cuts to interest rates', 'the inability to cut interest rates sufficiently can then reinforce downward pressures on inflation such that it begins to run persistently below the fomcs  percent goal and causes inflation expectations to fall with it', 'as is well known by now those revisions to the feds monetary policy framework put new emphasis on reaching maximum employment and introduced new flexibility in how to account for progress toward our pricestability goal by seeking inflation that averages  percent over time to ensure longerterm inflation expectations remain anchored at this level', 'this revision implies that monetary policy will provide more support for economic activity over a typical business cycle than had been the case in order to prevent longerterm inflation expectationsand ultimately inflation itselffrom settling below  percent', 'in this low interest rate environment some researchers have suggested going further than our current framework does in allowing inflation to run moderately above  percent for some time following periods where it has run persistently lower than  percent and actually raising the inflation target to . percent or  percent or even  percent', 'at the outset of our recently completed review we reaffirmed that inflation at a rate of  percent is most consistent over the longer run with our congressional mandate for price stability', 'i would also emphasize that at this point the public is very accustomed to a world of inflation near  percent which has allowed households and businesses to operate with considerable certainty', 'research shows that such certainty is valuable for households and businesses to make sound financial decisions and to avoid economic distortions that could hinder economic growth', 'my strong support for our consensus framework is predicated not only upon its new features designed to address inflation that falls too low but also its commitment to prevent longerterm inflation expectations from rising materially above a level consistent with our  percent goal', 'in this sense the current elevated rates of inflation are not challenging our new framework any more than they would have challenged our previous framework or for that matter most reasonable frameworks for conducting monetary policy', 'as i said earlier when our pricestability and employment goals are not complementary the framework calls for policy to depend on the remaining shortfall from our maximumemployment goal on the extent to which inflation continues to exceed  percent and on the amount of time we expect it will take for employment and inflation to meet our goals', 'but that forecast for growth and uncertainty about the resolution of supply constraints mean that there are upside risks to inflation next year', 'so my focus is beginning to turn more fully from the rapidly improving labor market to whether inflation begins its descent toward levels that are more

the conversation about how such disparities in income and wealth could be relevant for a macro understanding of the financial crisis and the recovery and the appropriate course of monetary policy today', 'these households which had endured  years of very sluggish realwage growth held an unusually large share of their wealth in housing much of it financed with debt', 'as a result over time their exposure to house prices had increased dramatically', 'the recovery has also been hampered by a continuation of longerterm trends that have reduced employment prospects for those at the lower end of the income distribution and produced weak wage growth', 'as just one example of the broader trend according to the congressional budget office between  and  inflationadjusted pretax income for a household in the top  percent more than doubled while in contrast income for a household in the middle of the income distribution increased less than  percent', 'many have argued that these disparities in income are hindering economic growth through their effects on consumption', 'intuitively one might assume that the growing concentration of income at the top could lead to less consumer spending and aggregate demand as wealthier households tend to save more of their additional income than others', 'more generally the evidence is equivocal as to whether there is an empirical relationship between higher income inequality and reduced aggregate demand', 'in my view understanding the links between greater concentrations of income variation in spending patterns throughout the income distribution and the effect of that variation on aggregate consumptionand ultimately growthrequires more exploration', 'hence families with moremodest incomes have much less wealth to cushion themselves against income shocks such as unemployment', 'because the wealth of people at the lower end of the distribution is concentrated in housing these households are disproportionately exposed to swings in house prices', 'thus the direct positive effect of rising house prices on most households net worth was largely offset by the negative effect of increased debt that households took on', 'but when house prices began falling the mortgage debt and repayment obligations remained', 'putting aside the practice in the runup to the crisis of lenders steering households to mortgage debt products that were more costly than what such households may have otherwise qualified for one reason may have been that many households in the middle and lower end of the income distribution whose wage earnings were stagnant did not recognize the longrun and persistent trends underlying their lack of income growth', 'at the same time many people believed that the sharp increases in their home values had made them permanently richer and that house prices would never turn down a belief that appears to have been shared by many households in the upper part of the income distribution as well',

disproportionate share of their assets in housing prior to the financial crisis and hence were very exposed to what was a historic decline in house prices', 'the unexpected drop in house prices on its own reduced both households wealth and their access to credit likely leading them to pull back their spending', 'in particular underwater borrowers and heavily indebted households were left with little collateral which limited their access to additional credit and their ability to refinance at lower interest rates', 'compounding the effect of falling house prices on household wealth and credit was the fact that these lowto middleincome households are also composed of some of the groups that have historically borne the brunt of downturns in the labor market', 'during recessions the young the less educated and minorities are more likely to experience flat or declining wages reduced hours and unemployment', 'higherincome households had also taken on debt and were affected by declines in asset prices', 'indeed a rapid downward spiral of tighter credit declines in asset prices rising unemployment and falling demand caused severe distress and a pullback in spending that was ultimately widespread across households', 'not only did they receive an unwelcome shock to their net current wealth but they also undoubtedly have come to realize that house prices will not rise indefinitely and that their labor income prospects are less rosy than they had believed', 'in this case the effects of the plunge in net wealth and the jump in unemployment on subsequent spending have been long lasting and lingering', 'overall debt levels remain higher than before the house price boom and many families continue to struggle to keep up with their monthly payments', 'it is hard to know just what the optimal debttoincome ratio is but in my view households will likely aim for something lower than before the financial crisis households are probably working toward lower moremanageable debt service obligations the heightened uncertainty in the recession may have raised the desired level of financial buffers and to the extent that households saw the negative shocks to house prices and income as permanent they are reducing their spending and thus their demand for new borrowing', 'while the process of household deleveraging has affected the spending and borrowing of

sluggishness of the recoverywith nearly  million jobs lost and still almost  million jobs below prerecession employment levelsit is very likely that for many households future labor earnings will be well below what they had anticipated in the years before the recession', 'the typical macroeconomic analysis focuses on the general equilibrium behavior of representative households and firms thereby

resource utilization the fomc has kept monetary policy highly accommodative by keeping its primary policy instrument the federal funds rate at an exceptionally low level by supplementing this move

pressure on longerterm interest rates thereby encouraging firms to invest in plants and equipment and helping enable households to purchase cars and other durable goods and also to refinance their mortgages', 'lower interest rates also support the prices of homes and other assets which can lead to additional spending', 'the resulting boost to demand leads firms to hire and invest further

foreclosure or have underwater mortgages or are otherwise credit constrained are less able than other households to take advantage of the lower interest rates either for homebuying or other purposes',

monetary policy could be increasingly potent', 'as house prices rise more and more households have enough home equity to gain renewed access to mortgage credit and the ability to refinance their homes

well crafted can lean against credit excesses that result in asset bubbles', 'in so doing they can lean against vulnerabilities in the financial system that encourage the growth of excess credit', 'and to approximate current economic conditions well assume an environment of interest rates that have been low and continue to be low for a long time', 'if many investors employ this strategy and they borrow to invest in the same asset the price of that asset and perhaps the prices of closely related assets as well will increase noticeably faster than the historical trend', 'at the same time increased demand for credit to finance these asset purchases could lead lenders to increase their reliance on less expensive unstable shortterm funding such as uninsured deposits commercial paper or repo transactions in order to fund the loans', 'besides meeting customers growing demands for credit financial intermediaries may themselves decide to reach for yield and take on additional risk in a low interestrate environment', 'banks suffering compressed net interest margins because of low longterm interest rates money market funds facing an earnings squeeze insurance companies that had promised minimum rates of return on their products and others may all begin to take on higher interest rate risk market risk liquidity risk or credit risk in search of higher returns', 'if these conditions seem likely to continue an initial rise in the assets price leads to expectations of further increases which adds to investor demand spurring further borrowing and credit growth and increased household and financial sector leverage which in turn could drive asset prices still higher', 'rising asset prices in turn would increase the value of borrowers collateral allowing still further borrowing', 'for loans collateralized by an asset whose price is rising lenders believe they can rely for repayment more on the appreciation of the asset and collateral and less on the borrowers repayment ability', 'to compete for loans to buy or to hold the appreciating asset or financial assets related to it financial institutions could also decrease the margins and haircuts that usually protect them from asset price declines', 'financial institution decisions to relax underwriting and impose lessstringent margins and haircuts will further increase the pool of potential borrowers and their borrowing capacity further increasing credit growth and supporting still higher asset prices but at the same time will also increase lenders credit risks and exposureas secured creditorsto a decline in the assets price', 'ultimately the asset becomes severely overvalued with its price untethered from economic fundamentals', 'and as we experienced in the financial crisis when a bubble involving a widelyheld asset bursts the consequent plunge in asset prices can seriously impair the balance sheets of households and firms', 'indeed a dramatic decline in the price of a significant asset can reduce household wealth spending and aggregate demand', 'when such effects on wealth credit availability and aggregate demand are large enough the real economy can suffer a significant recession', 'and of course lower employment and incomes further depress asset prices and borrowers ability to repay loans with further adverse effects on financial institutions and their ability to extend credit', 'such a loss of confidence in turn makes it impossible for affected institutions to roll over existing debts or extend new credit and may force deleveraging that requires selling illiquid assets quickly and cheaply in asset fire sales resulting in further declines in asset prices', 'home prices rose dramatically for a decade and then plunged more than  percent throwing the financial system into chaos severely contracting credit and triggering the most severe recession in modern memory', 'and asset bubbles are characterized by many investors chasing the same asset and so there is generally widespread participation in the growth and nurturing of the bubble', 'but it is my view that asset bubbles are a feature of our financial landscape that what happened before could happen again and that the growth and aftereffects of asset bubbles reflect particular financial institution decisions and particular regulatory policy choices or lapses', 'responding to asset price bubbles the good news is that i believe that regulatory policy when part of a system of effective prudential supervision has the potential to address asset price bubbles and their consequences',

monetary policy', 'without plumbing the depths of each type of tool ill say a few words about each as it relates to the curbing of excess credit growth that fuels asset bubbles and to mitigating the effects of a bubbles collapse', 'thus higher capital requirements to some degree also lean against excessive credit growth that can fuel asset bubbles', 'in that sense minimum liquidity requirements also lean against building vulnerabilities that could accompany the growth of an asset bubble', 'haircuts tend to be cyclical falling in good times which adds to the growth of credit and rising in busts which contracts credit', 'it could also make it more expensive to fund the purchase of the securities and so could limit the amount of borrowing that could be supported by an asset of given value this in turn might limit creditfueled increases in the assets price', 'in other words by requiring increased margin the growth of credit can be slowed and resiliency can be strengthened', 'this would lean against the growth of bubbles even if regulators had not yet discerned the particular type of asset bubble growing', 'tighter minimum down payment requirements in good times would likely reduce defaults and build lender resilience to later losses due to asset price declines', 'at the same time by actively leaning progressively harder against propertyrelated credit expansion they may restrain excessive credit growth and property price appreciation and reduce the chancesand magnitudeof a sharp price bust', 'in hong kong for example tighter down payment rules reduce household leverage and the sensitivity of defaults to changes in property prices and have been shown to slow property appreciation', 'regulatory policies that aim to increase the resilience of regulated institutions and lean against asset bubbles by restraining the growth of lending by such institutions can be circumvented when financial activities migrate into less regulated parts of the financial system parts likely farther from the protections of deposit insurance and the lender of last resort', 'and such a fragmented structure itself demands unusual and extensive degrees of coordination and cooperation among financial regulators so as to maximize the potential for comprehensive and harmonized regulation', 'in reality it is hard to know in real time when asset prices have deviated sharply

exert such a powerful influence on longterm real rates', 'this observation then raises the question of why monetary policy might be able to influence real term premiums', 'here is where we draw our

implications of the reachforyield mechanism on the pricing of interest rate risk also known as duration risk', 'this in turn creates buying pressure that raises the price of the longterm bonds and hence lowers longterm yields and forward rates', 'thus according to this theory an easing of monetary policy affects longterm real rates not via the usual expectations channel but rather via what might be termed a recruitment channelby causing an outward shift in the demand curve of yieldoriented investors thereby inducing these investors to take on more interest rate risk and to push down term premiums', 'overall i read this evidence as suggestingalbeit tentativelythat some mechanism involving yieldoriented investors may eventually turn out to be central to our understanding of how monetary policy works both in ordinary and extraordinary times', 'when i say central i mean that this mechanism may play a role not only in determining how monetary policy influences the pricing of credit risk but also in how it shapes the real and nominal yield curves for creditriskfree treasury securities', 'according to this view real and nominal term premiums were low not just because we were buying longterm bonds but because our policies induced an outward shift in the demand curve of other investors which led them to do more buying on our behalfbecause we both gave them an incentive to reach for yield and at the same time provided a set of implicit assurances that tamped down volatility and made it feel safer to lever aggressively in pursuit of that extra yield', 'indeed my whole point in talking about the research i described earlier was to underscore my belief that something like this investorrecruitment mechanism is central to how monetary policy acquires much of its traction over the real economy even in ordinary times', 'but in an important sense this effect is just a poweredup version of what makes gardenvariety monetary policy work', 'when we talk about the interplay of monetary policy and financial stability i think that this kind of tradeoff is an important part of what we should be bearing in mind', 'having said all of this i believe we are currently in a pretty good place with respect to the pricing of interest rate risk', 'for this reason my personal preference would be to make future stepdowns a completely deterministic function of a labor market indicator such as the unemployment rate or cumulative payroll growth over some period', 'for example one could cut monthly purchases by a set amount for each further  basis point decline in the unemployment rate', 'obviously the unemployment rate is not a perfect summary statistic for our labor market objectives but i believe that this approach would help to reduce uncertainty about our

plants that shut down because of a shortage of one or more crucial inputs a poor cotton crop in the united states due to weather which is driving up prices and clogged ports and trucker shortages',

inflation expectations become unanchored the credibility of our inflation target is at risk and we likely would need to take action to reanchor expectations at our  percent target', 'this raises a couple of key questions whose inflation expectations do we examine and how do we determine if they are unanchored', 'with regard to the first question we measure inflation expectations two ways', 'first we survey the public and ask them what they expect the inflation rate to be in coming years', 'second we can infer inflation expectations from differences in yields between treasury securities that are indexed for inflation and those that are not', 'these breakeven inflation measures from the treasury inflationprotected securities market are referred to as market based measures of inflation compensation', 'survey measures give us an idea of what the average household expects inflation to be in the coming years', 'presumably this measure of expectations is important because it should influence households wage demands as they seek compensation for an increasing cost of living', 'this is why i have always preferred marketbased measures of inflation expectations because they are formed by investors who are betting with real money about future inflation', 'this brings us to another question are inflation expectations anchored around our inflation target of  percent', 'survey measures have shown a dramatic increase in inflation expectations over the past few months', 'the recent new york fed measure has shortand mediumterm inflation expectations at . percent and . percent respectively', 'this is eye opening and a genuine cause for concern should households embed these expectations in wage demands', 'however marketbased measures of inflation expectations and the

which distills a signal from both surveys and marketbased inflation gauges', 'this gives me some comfort that the recent run of high inflation readings has not led to an unanchoring of inflation expectations', 'it is important to account for all measures of inflation expectations and not cherry pick the measure that one finds most comforting', 'i would like to follow up on this last point as it pertains to thinking about inflation', 'as i mentioned earlier a lot of commentators including me have deflected concerns about high inflation readings being the result of outliers or idiosyncratic price movements', 'as a result recent high inflation readings are transitory and not broad based', 'but there is a fallacy in doing so that one should avoid in judging whether higher inflation is indeed transitory', 'there are sound reasons for this such as when we exclude volatile food and energy prices to get a measure of core inflation that kind of measure often is more stable and can tell us whether the underlying forces behind inflation are moving as rapidly as it might seem from headline inflation', 'a similar logic applies to trimmed mean measures of inflation such as the cleveland fed trimmed mean consumer price index and the dallas fed trimmed mean pce personal consumption expenditures inflation rate', 'these measures censor the tails of the price change distribution to avoid having average inflation distorted by extreme price movements', 'however inflation is distilled from many prices and those prices do not move uniformly', 'as a result we may be led to falsely dismiss certain price movements and risk being misled as to the true inflation rate', 'consider a threegood economy with goods a b and c and look at how their prices increase over time', 'in one world the price of each good goes up  percent every year', 'thus average inflation is  percent every year and there is no reason to question that measure as it is broad based', 'this is typically what we have in mind when we think about trend inflation', 'in this world inflation is meeting the fomcs  percent target and there is no need for a policy change', 'now consider a world in which there are sharp price changes that are staggered across the goods', 'in year  the price of good a goes up  percent while the price of goods b and c increase  percent', 'if we assume equal weights for each good the inflation rate for this economy is  percent', 'this repeats in year  with the price of good b increasing  percent while the other two have increases of  percent', 'in this economy inflation averages  percent each year which is above the fomcs  percent inflation target', 'first if one used a trimmedmean measure of inflation you would throw out the highest and the lowest readings for each year', 'the average inflation rate would be  percent every year', 'thus over a threeyear period a trimmed mean measure of inflation would be  percent and indicate we are hitting our inflation target when the true measure would be  percent per year', 'a second way of manipulating the data is to say in year  look inflation is being driven by good a which had an idiosyncratic outsized price increase', 'if you throw it out the underlying inflation rate is  percent', 'then in year  you say good b had an idiosyncratic price increase so throw it out', 'again by selectively throwing out unusually high price increases for individual goods you would conclude that inflation over the threeyear period is  percent and we are hitting the inflation target when in fact it was  percent', 'third one can justify throwing out good a in the first year by saying it did not reflect a broadbased price increasethe prices of  percent of the goods rose  percent', 'so based on these goods we are hitting our inflation target', 'finally one could claim correctly that the large price increase for good a is transitoryit went up strikingly in year  but then dropped back meaning inflation should fall back to our inflation target in coming periods', 'but that will mislead you in terms of understanding the true inflation rate because you are putting zero probability that a large spike in inflation will happen to another good in the future', 'the moral of this little example is that one needs to be careful when selectively ignoring data seriesbe it used car prices food and energy prices or household surveys of inflation expectations', 'all of these series convey important information about the evolution of inflation and one should exhibit caution in dismissing data as outliers', 'we must keep our eyes open to inflationary pressures wherever they come from with consistency and rigor and stand ready to adjust policy if we conclude that such a change is warranted', 'this brings me to how i believe monetary policy should evolve in the coming months based on the outlook i have described', 'our test for this step was making substantial further progress toward our employment and inflation goals', 'after years of running below  percent the recent and sustained increase in inflation clearly represents substantial progress toward our goal', 'and the continued gains in employment despite a couple of months of a slowdown along with results across a range of labor market indicators indicate to me that there has also been substantial further progress toward maximum employment', 'importantly this action should not tighten financial conditions since a later  tapering has already been priced in by most participants', 'i believe the pace of continued improvement in the labor market will be gradual and i expect inflation will moderate which means liftoff is still some time off', 'that said as i mentioned earlier if my upside risk for inflation comes to pass with inflation considerably

unemployment that is just as plausible if not more so', 'these two dots suggest that the vacancy rate can be reduced substantially from the current level to the january  level while still leaving the level of vacancies consistent with a strong labor market and with a low level of unemployment such as we had in', 'to see why this is a plausible outcome i first need to digress a bit to discuss the important determinants of unemployment', 'many factors influence the unemployment rate and vacancies are just one', 'thus to understand how a lower vacancy rate would influence unemployment going forward we need to separate the direct effect of vacancies on the unemployment rate from other factors', 'to do that we first need to review the factors that account for unemployment movements', 'there are two broad determinants of unemployment separations from employment including layoffs and quits which raise unemployment and job finding by the unemployed which lowers unemployment', 'to see how separations and job finding affect the unemployment rate its helpful to start with equation  on slide  which states that in a steady state that is when the unemployment rate is constant flows into unemployment the left side of equation  must equal flows out of unemployment the right side', 'flows into unemployment equal the separations rate s times the level of employment', 'for simplicity ive normalized the labor force to  so that employment equals  minus unemployment u', 'flows out of unemployment the right side of the equation equal the rate of job finding f times the number of unemployed', 'rearranging this equation yields an expression for the steadystate unemployment rate equation', 'because flows into and out of unemployment are quite high the actual unemployment rate converges to the steadystate unemployment rate quickly and the steadystate unemployment rate typically tracks the actual rate closely', 'so going forward im going to think of the steadystate unemployment rate as a good approximation of the actual unemployment rate', 'if we divide both sides of equation  by unemployment we get equation  which expresses the jobfinding rate as a function of the ratio of vacancies to unemployment or labor market tightness', 'the last step is to plug our expression for job finding into equation  the steadystate unemployment rate yielding equation', 'equation  shows how vacancies affect the unemployment rate', 'that is i pick a separation rate at some level and trace out what happens to the unemployment rate as the vacancy rate changes', 'then i pick a different separation rate and again trace out the effect of vacancies on unemployment', 'the result is shown on slide  which plots four curves showing the effect of vacancies on unemployment for four different separation rates', 'because more vacancies generate fewer and fewer hires they result in smaller and smaller reductions in unemployment', 'but large numbers of vacancies are of course a hallmark of tight labor markets and additional vacancies continue to strongly boost wage growth and quits', 'you can see that when the separations rate is this high the unemployment rate is also going to be high no matter the level of vacancies', 'at the same time greater labor demand increases vacancies causing the labor market to move up the steep curves', 'as you recall the black curve fits the actual observations on unemployment and vacancies we saw before the pandemic', 'and we now can see that these observations are produced by a combination of changes in vacancies and separations as well as other influences on unemployment', 'decreases in the separations rate reduce the unemployment rate without changing vacancies imparting a flatness to the fitted curve relative to the steeper curves that only reflect the effect of vacancies', 'what does all this suggest about what will happen to the labor market when as i expect a tightening of financial conditions and fading fiscal stimulus start to cool labor demand', 'slide  focuses on the beveridge curve the relationship produced by the direct effect of changes in vacancies on unemployment when the separations rate is low as it is now', 'if there is cooling in aggregate demand spurred by monetary policy tightening that tempers labor demand then vacancies should fall substantially', 'the unemployment rate will increase but only somewhat because labor demand is still strongjust not as strongand because when the labor market is very tight as it is now vacancies generate relatively few hires', 'thus reducing vacancies from an extremely high level to a lower but still strong level has a relatively limited effect on hiring and on unemployment', 'now i also show the january  observation of vacancies and unemployment', 'as you can see moving from the march  observation to the january  observation is not that different from the change in the unemployment rate predicted by my estimated beveridge curve which suggests the predicted small increase in unemployment is a plausible outcome to policy tightening', 'if labor demand cools will separations increase and shift the curve outward increasing unemployment further', 'instead changes in labor demand appear to be reflected primarily in changes in vacancies', 'now its certainly possible even probable that influences on the unemployment rate other than vacancies will change going forward', 'thus im not arguing that the unemployment rate will end up exactly as the beveridge curve ive drawn suggests', 'but i do think it quite plausible that the unemployment rate will end up in the vicinity of what the beveridge curve currently predicts', 'another consideration is that nonlinear dynamics could take hold if the unemployment rate increases by a certain amount as suggested by the sahm rule which holds that recessions have in the past occurred whenever the threemonth moving average of the unemployment rate rises . percentage point over its minimum rate over the previous  months', 'to sum up the relationship between vacancies and unemployment gives me reason to hope that policy tightening in current circumstances can tame inflation

in energy prices we saw in the second half of  hasnt offset the huge increases earlier', 'the second reason that i wouldnt exclude food energy and housing prices or want to move toward a narrower inflation target is that by any measure of headline inflation they constitute a large share of expenses paid by people', 'the third reason to include rather than exclude these prices in considering inflation is that they make up an even larger share of expenses for lowerincome people who have less savings and other means to deal with the ups and downs of their finances and the economy', 'because of this disparity when inflation peaked last summer lowerincome households effectively faced inflation that was a percentage point higher than was paid by higherincome households', 'lastly and this is

their levels at the onset of the pandemic likely boosted by the sharply rising input costs farmers have been facing which i discussed earlier', 'however futures prices for these commodities suggest limited movements in these prices through year end', 'if this plays out with a slowdown in wage increases that should occur because of tighter monetary policy this should help continue to moderate food inflation over the next few years', 'finally lets turn to energy inflation', 'households spend less than  percent of their pce basket on gasoline electricity and heating but as seen in the left panel of figure  the energy price index skyrocketed over the past couple of years reflecting a surge in crude oil prices after the pandemic recession which was exacerbated by russias invasion of ukraine', 'turning to the month change the right panel energy prices have been declining sharply recently and we expect them to continue to decline this year reflecting the path of crude oil futures

the economy and setting appropriate monetary policy and also a reminder for me about the trust i bear as a public official', 'most practically if i had focused on core inflation over the last two

of this inescapable reality for many millions of people', 'fortunately there are signs that food energy and shelter prices will moderate this year', 'an important factor has been the federal reserves

respond to movements in output employment and inflation in a systematic way using a formula intended to be applicable over time and in different circumstances', 'today it is widely accepted by economists that monetary policy rules can be activist rules', 'a second related message of mccallums work was that different rule specifications can concretely characterize differences among economists on appropriate monetary policy', 'that is mccallum wanted to represent alternative perspectives on monetary policy as different rule specifications and he urged the study of rules as a means of understanding various policy prescriptions and their consequences for the economy', 'indeed the box on monetary policy rules that regularly appears in the federal reserve boards monetary policy report provides a menu of policy rules designed to reflect a variety of views about the appropriate formulation of monetary policy', 'he recognized that policy rules were not likely to be used

such rules could provide an anchor on the economys nominal variables', 'consequently mccallum was receptive when the taylor rule became a baseline reaction function in monetary policy analysis',

manner that is much more accurately depicted by writing the interest rate as the instrument', 'reflecting this reality all the rules considered in our monetary policy report are interest rate rules',

target is consistent with our dual mandate which includes a pricestability goal', 'in  john taylor suggested that a  percent inflation objective characterized the federal reserves behavior in the early greenspan years pretty well', 'in  as i noted earlier the committee made a goal of  percent inflation its formal interpretation of the pricestability objective', 'the choice of a  percent

response needed to return inflation to  percent i find it useful to draw on the findings of the policy rules literature', 'these findings include the taylor principle notion that deviations of inflation from target should likely be met by a more than oneforone response of the federal funds ratea response that helps ensure that the real interest rate is increased in policy tightenings', 'the other part of our dual mandate is the goal of maximum employment', 'reflecting the fact that this goal refers to the labor market rather than economic activity the interest rate rules considered in the monetary policy report put the real target in terms of an unemployment gap rather than an output gap', 'on the matter of how this rule should be used as an input into policymaking the main thing that i would stress is that there are multiple dimensions of labor market conditions as well as considerable uncertainty about the level of maximum employment', 'as a result caution is justified in having monetary policy responding to gap estimates', 'i therefore see merit in mccallums warning against monetary policy responding strongly to the output gap', 'in this connection athanasios orphanidess research suggests that estimates of the first difference of economic slack or excess demand pressure may be less vulnerable to mismeasurement than the corresponding estimates of the

more standard variants of the taylor rule', 'conclusion staying on the topic of policy targets i think it is worth concluding by emphasizing an important respect in which things have not changed since

expectations has meant that the price increases driven by costs of oil and other commodities have had only temporary effects on the rate of inflation', 'although firms passed higher input costs into their prices when they could do so those onetime price increases have not led to an expectationsdriven process that might have resulted in persistently higher inflation', 'the same key factors that

policy', 'optimal control can be used under certain assumptions to obtain a prescription for the path of monetary policy conditional on a baseline forecast of economic conditions', 'optimal control typically involves the selection of a particular model to represent the dynamics of the economy as well as the specification of a loss function that represents the social costs of deviations of inflation from the committees longerrun goal and of deviations of unemployment from its longerrun normal rate', 'in effect this approach assumes that the policymaker has perfect foresight about the evolution of the economy and that the private sector can fully anticipate the future path of monetary policy that is the central banks plans are completely transparent and credible to the public', 'to show what an optimal control approach might have called for at the time of the january fomc meeting figure  depicts a purely illustrative baseline outlook constructed using the distribution of fomc

tendency of the committees projections through', 'the unemployment rate gradually converges to around  percentroughly the midpoint of the central tendency of participants longrun projections of these factorsand inflation converges to the committees longerrun goal of  percent', 'this highly accommodative policy path generates according to the frbus model a notably faster reduction in unemployment than in the baseline outlook', 'in addition the inflation rate runs close to the fomcs longerrun goal of  percent over coming years', 'one reason this exercise generates a better outcome is because it assumes that the federal reserves inflation objective is fully crediblethat is all households and businesses fully understand the federal reserves goals and believe that policymakers will follow the optimal policy designed to meet those goals', 'this belief ties down longerterm inflation expectations in the model even while it allows the lower interest rate to spur faster growth in output and employment', 'i therefore consider it imprudent to place too much weight on the policy prescriptions obtained from these methods so i simultaneously consider other approaches for gauging the appropriate stance of monetary policy', 'alternative benchmarks for monetary policy simple rules an alternative approach that i find helpful in evaluating the stance of policy is to consult prescriptions from simple policy rules', 'moreover given our statutory mandate of maximum employment and price stability it seems reasonable to focus on rules that mirror these two objectives by prescribing how the federal funds rate should be adjusted in response to two gaps the deviation of inflation from its longerrun goal and the deviation of unemployment from my estimate of its longerrun normal rate', 'in particular any benchmark rule should conform to the socalled taylor principle which states that other things being equal a central bank should respond to a persistent increase in inflation by raising nominal shortterm interest rates by more than the increase in inflation so that the real rate of interest rises thereby helping to bring inflation back down', 'moreover i think it is essential that policy rules incorporate a sufficiently strong response to resource slack typically either the output gap or the unemployment gap to help bring the economy back toward full employment expeditiously', 'importantly because of the stabilizing effects of the taylor principle both the taylor  and taylor  rules imply that inflation returns over time to the longerrun goal of  percent', 'many studies including taylors own analysis suggest that the taylor  rule generates considerably less variability in real activity and only slightly more variability in inflation than his original rule', 'in particular this rule does not fully take into account the implications of the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates and hence tends to understate the rationale for maintaining a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy under present circumstances', 'in effect there has been a significant shortfall in the overall amount of monetary policy stimulus since early  relative to the prescriptions of the simple rules that ive described', 'analysis by some of my federal reserve colleagues suggests that monetary policy can produce better economic outcomes if it commits to making up for at least some portion of the cumulative shortfall created by the zero lower boundnamely by maintaining a highly accommodative monetary policy for longer than a simple rule would otherwise prescribe', 'in particular the fomc has considerable latitude to withdraw policy accommodation if the economic recovery were to proceed much faster than expected or if inflation were to come in higher', 'in contrast if the recovery faltered or inflation drifted down the committee could provide additional stimulus using its unconventional tools but doing so involves costs and risks', 'given the unprecedented nature of the current economic situation and the limits placed on conventional policy by the zero lower bound on interest rates these issues of risk management take on special importance', 'such rules can serve as useful benchmarks for facilitating monetary policy deliberations and communications but a dose of good judgment will always be essential as well', 'uncertainty

high unemployment than is embodied in the consensus forecasts', 'such developments would likely have substantial adverse effects on u.s. economic activity and inflation', 'as i noted the decline weve

balancedapproach rule achieves a more rapid reduction of the unemployment rate than monetary policy under the taylor  rule does while nonetheless keeping inflation near  percent', 'but the improvement in labor market conditions is even more notable under the optimal control path even as inflation remains close to the fomcs longrun inflation objective', 'one of these shortcomings is that the rules do not adjust for the constraints that the zero lower bound has placed on conventional monetary policy since late', 'a second is that they do not fully take account of the protracted nature of the forces that have been restraining aggregate demand in the aftermath of the housing bust', 'as a result the economys equilibrium real federal funds ratethat is the rate that would be consistent with full employment over the medium runis probably well below its historical average which the intercept of simple policy rules is supposed to approximate', 'if the committee were to judge that the recovery is unlikely to proceed at a satisfactory pace for example that the forecast entails little or no improvement in the labor market over the next few years or that the downside risks to the outlook had become sufficiently great or that inflation appeared to be in danger of declining notably below its  percent objective i am convinced that scope remains for the fomc to provide further policy accommodation either through its forward guidance or through additional balancesheet actions', 'i disagree with this view the fomc has tested a variety of tools to ensure that we will be able to raise shortterm interest rates when needed while gradually returning the portfolio to a more normal size and composition', 'but even if unjustified such concerns could in theory reduce confidence in the federal reserve and so lead to an undesired increase in inflation expectations', 'conclusion in my remarks this evening i have sought to explain why in my view a highly accommodative monetary policy will remain appropriate for some time to come', 'my views concerning the stance of monetary policy reflect the fomcs firm commitment to the goals of maximum employment and stable prices my appraisal of the medium term outlook which is importantly shaped by the persistent legacy of the housing bust and ensuing financial crisis and by my assessment of the balance of risks facing the economy', 'for this reason the fomcs forward guidance is explicitly conditioned on its anticipation of low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run', 'if the recovery were to proceed faster than expected or if inflation pressures were to pick up materially the fomc could adjust policy by bringing forward the expected date of tightening', 'it is for this reason that the fomc emphasized in its statement following the april meeting that it would regularly review the size and composition of its securities holdings and is prepared to adjust those

decisions was the best policy central banks as a rule did not discuss these decisions let alone their future policy intentions', 'while the federal reserve is required by the congress to promote stable prices and maximum employment federal reserve officials at that time avoided discussing how policy would be used to pursue both sides of this mandate', 'indeed mere mention of the employment

policymakers first setting policy to pursue the longerrun objectives and second adjusting policy in response to shocks to minimize shorterrun fluctuations around those objectives', 'in the words of

longterm interest rates and enhancing the committees ability to promote maximum employment in the face of significant economic disturbances', 'put differently the purpose of providing greater clarity about the fomcs longerrun inflation goal is to anchor inflation expectations more firmly', 'these more firmly anchored expectations in turn free the committees hand to more actively and effectively stabilize shortrun fluctuations in economic activity', 'the committee can act in this way because the fomc can tolerate transitory deviations of inflation from its objective in order to more forcefully stabilize employment without needing to worry that the public will mistake these actions as the pursuit of a higher or lower longrun inflation objective', 'the instability of inflation inflation expectations and employment in response to the oil price increases of the s vividly illustrates the threat posed by price shocks when longerterm inflation expectations are not well anchored', 'to minimize shortrun fluctuations the fomc also needs to decide how to respond to shocks that push the economy away from price stability and maximum employment', 'the goals of stable prices and maximum employment are often complementary policymakers need not sacrifice performance on one goal to pursue the other', 'for example returning inflation to its longerrun goal might require say a tighter stance of monetary policy whereas returning the economy to maximum employment might require just the opposite', 'the balancedapproach strategy endorsed by the fomc is consistent with the view that maximum employment and price stability stand on an equal footing as objectives of monetary policy', 'the first is that if the fomc is doing its best to minimize deviations from its objectives then over long periods both unemployment and inflation will be about equally likely to fall on either side of those objectives', 'to put it simply if  percent inflation is the committees goal  percent cannot be viewed as a ceiling for inflation because that would result in deviations that are more frequently below  percent than above and thus not properly balanced with the goal of maximum employment', 'instead to balance the chances that inflation will sometimes deviate a bit above and a bit below the goal  percent must be treated as a central tendency around which inflation fluctuates', 'the same holds true for fluctuations of unemployment around its longerrun normal rate', 'in particular reducing inflation may sometimes require a monetary tightening that will lead to a temporary rise in unemployment', 'and a policy that reduces unemployment may at times result in inflation that could temporarily rise above its target', 'in addition to clearly specified goals concrete recommendations about appropriate monetary policy require the specification of a baseline outlook for the economy and also a realistic quantitative model of the economy to assess how monetary policy choices affect the likely paths of the fomcs goal variablesnamely inflation and the unemployment rate', 'the baseline paths through  of the unemployment rate and inflation shown by the solid black lines in the upper two panels track the median of the dealers forecasts of these variables', 'beyond  the path assumes that the unemployment rate converges over time to  percentthe median forecast of the longrun unemployment rate which is the upper end of the range of estimates of the longerrun normal unemployment rate cited in the fomc consensus statementwhile the inflation rate settles down at  percent the fomcs inflation objective and the median longrun forecast in the dealer survey', 'as i noted this balanced approach means inflation and unemployment will sometimes temporarily deviate from longerrun objectives but that these deviations would be minimized', 'the model lets us analyze every possible policy path to see which one yields the best feasible outcome for the paths of unemployment and inflation', 'to derive a path for the federal funds rate consistent with the committees enunciated longerrun goals and balanced approach i assume that monetary policy aims to minimize the deviations of inflation from  percent and the deviations of the unemployment rate from  percent with equal weight on both objectives', 'the optimal policy to implement this balanced approach to minimizing deviations from the inflation and unemployment goals involves keeping the federal funds rate close to zero until early  about two quarters longer than in the illustrative baseline and keeping the federal funds rate below the baseline path through', 'this highly accommodative policy path generates a faster reduction in unemployment than in the baseline while inflation slightly overshoots the committees  percent objective for several years', 'provided that longterm inflation expectations are firmly anchored the federal funds rate is set to balance the benefits from a faster reduction of the unemployment rate against the losses from a temporary and modest increase of inflation above  percent', 'the more rapid reduction in unemployment along the optimal control path than in the baseline reflects the stimulus to demand provided by lower nominal and real interest rates higher asset prices and the expectation of more rapid growth in employment and income', 'the computation of an optimal path for monetary policy is obviously complicated and as ill discuss its challenging to communicate', 'to be sure i would never advocate turning over monetary policy to a computer but why shouldnt the fomc adopt such a rule as a guidepost to policy', 'the red lines with squares labeled modified taylor rule show the economic outcomes that would be expected if the federal funds rate were set according to the prescriptions of a rule that is similar to the original taylor rule with the only difference being that it responds equally to deviations of unemployment and inflation from their respective longerrun values', 'the figure shows that this rule would raise the federal funds rate substantially earlier than the optimal path and thereby leads to more protracted deviations of the unemployment rate above its longerrun normal level without any measurable gains in keeping inflation closer to the  percent target', 'the challenge facing the fomc now is to devise ways to communicate its policy intentions during a period in which policy will most likely be constrained by the zero bound on shortterm rates and asset purchases will be actively used to foster faster growth', 'this later liftoff date is consistent with the committees statement that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the economic recovery strengthens', 'finally with respect to asset purchases the guidance indicates that subject to ongoing evaluations of their efficacy and costs purchases will continue until there is a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market in a context of price stability', 'importantly this openended plan reflects a goaloriented approach in which the ultimate quantity of asset purchases will be geared to the attainment of sufficient progress toward the committees employment goal', 'that is the committee could provide the public with its projections for inflation and the unemployment rate together with what it views as appropriate paths both for the federal funds rate and its asset holdings conditional on its current outlook for the economy', 'several inflationtargeting central banks such as those in sweden and norway publish forecasts of this type', 'the idea is to define a zone of combinations of the unemployment rate and inflation

the federal funds rate in its current low range at least until unemployment has declined below  percent provided that inflation over the medium term remains below  percent', 'narayana kocherlakota president of the minneapolis fed suggests thresholds of . percent for unemployment and . percent for the mediumterm inflation outlook', 'perhaps more importantly the use of inflation and unemployment thresholds would help the public understand whether a shift in the calendar date assuming that one is still included in the statement reflects a change in the committees economic outlook or alternatively a change in its view concerning the appropriate degree of accommodation', 'since monetary policy works in large part through the publics perceptions of the fomcs systematic behavior this distinction is critical', 'beyond that i believe better communication serves to improve the efficacy of monetary policy at a time when the fomc faces constraints on its ability to provide appropriate

amount of variation in the balance between job openings and unemployment across sectors', 'this and related research suggests to me first that a broadbased cyclical shortage of demand is the main cause of todays elevated unemployment rate and second that whatever problems there may be today with labor market functioning are likely to be substantially resolved as the broader economy improves and bolsters the demand for labor', 'but making this transition will be much easier in a healthy economy which is one reason why i am encouraged by the evidence that elevated unemployment is indeed largely cyclical', 'i will now describe what the federal reserve is doing to try to raise demand and create jobs', 'the first is largescale asset purchases intended to lower longterm interest rates to encourage borrowing for spending and investment', 'unlike its past purchase programs which were fixed in size this time the fomc stated its determination to continue the program provided that inflation remains well contained until it judges that there has been a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market', 'the second unconventional policy tool that the fomc has used is forward guidance in the form of moreexplicit and moredetailed information about the future path of monetary policy', 'the longerterm interest rates that most profoundly influence housing demand capital spending and asset prices depend on current and expected future levels of shortterm interest rates such as the federal funds rate that has been the feds conventional monetary policy tool', 'signaling the future path of the federal funds rate can therefore directly affect interest rates today on auto loans home mortgages and bonds issued by companies and state and local governments even when the current level of the federal funds rate cannot be lowered', 'a disadvantage of this calendarbased approach was that it might not be clear whether changes in the date reflect changes in the fomcs outlook for growth for inflation or a shift in the desired stance of policy', 'specifically it stated that nearzero rates would likely remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above  percent inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the committees  percent longerrun goal and longerterm inflation expectations continue to be well anchored', 'it deserves emphasis that a  percent unemployment rate and inflation one to two years ahead that is  percentage point above the committees  percent objective are thresholds for possible action not triggers that will necessarily prompt an immediate increase in the fomcs target rate', 'in practical terms it means that the committee does not expect to raise the federal funds rate as long as unemployment remains above  percent and inflation one to two years ahead is projected to be less than  percentage point above its  percent objective', 'with respect to maximum employment most fomc participants continue to estimate that the longerrun normal unemployment rate lies in a range of . to  percent and the committee continues to believe an inflation rate of  percent as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures is most consistent with the federal reserves dual mandate', 'importantly these quantitative goals are neither ceilings nor floors for inflation and unemployment and the committee will take a balanced approach to returning both measures to their objectives over time', 'with employment so far from its maximum level and with inflation currently running and expected to continue to run at or below the committees  percent longerterm objective it is entirely appropriate for progress in attaining maximum employment to take center stage in determining the committees policy stance', 'while the committees longerterm goals remain unchanged what has changed is that the fomc is now providing more information about how it expects to pursue its inflation and employment goals', 'in particular we will employ our policy tools as appropriate to raise aggregate demand and employment in the context of continued price stability consistent with our balanced approach', 'thats good news for workers because i believe that these steps will increase demand and more demand means more jobs', 'it will be a long road back to a healthy job market', 'the job market is improving']"

fomc participants reported in december that they expected only a gradual decline in unemployment over the next two years to about  percent by the end of', 'a broader measure of underemployment that includes these and others who want a job stands at . percent nearly double the . percent headline rate that is most commonly reported in the media', 'the large shortfall of employment relative to its maximum level has imposed huge burdens on all too many american households and represents a substantial social cost', 'if these jobless workers were to become less employable the natural rate of unemployment might rise or to the extent that they leave the labor force we could see a persistently lower rate of labor force participation', 'in addition the slow recovery has depressed the pace of capital accumulation and it may also have hindered new business formation and innovation developments that would have an adverse effect on structural productivity', 'in contrast to the large gap between actual and maximum employment inflation apart from fluctuations due to energy and other commodity prices has been running for some time now a little below the rate of  percent per year that the committee judges to be consistent with the federal reserves dual mandate', 'the committee anticipates that inflation will continue to run at or below  percent over the medium term', 'moreover expectations for inflation over the next  to  years remain well anchored according to surveys of households and professional forecasters', 'with employment so far from its maximum level and with inflation running below the committees  percent objective i believe its appropriate for progress in the labor market to take center stage in the conduct of monetary policy', 'in current circumstances forward guidance can lower privatesector expectations regarding the future path of shortterm rates thereby reducing longerterm interest rates on a wide range of debt instruments and also raising asset prices leading to more accommodative financial conditions', 'starting in march  the fomcs postmeeting statements noted that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period and in november of the same year added low rates of resource utilization subdued inflation trends and stable inflation expectations as justification for this stance', 'also in september the committee changed the language related to that commitment dropping the reference to low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation', 'instead it emphasized that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the economic recovery strengthens clarifying the committees intention to continue to provide support well into the recovery', 'specifically the committee anticipates that exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above  percent inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the committees  percent longerrun goal and longerterm inflation expectations continue to be well anchored', 'in my view the language now incorporated into the statement affirmatively conveys the committees determination to keep monetary policy highly accommodative until well into the recovery', 'first in the aftermath of the financial crisis there has been an unusually large and persistent shortfall in aggregate demand', 'second use of the federal funds rate has been constrained by the effective lower bound so that monetary policy has been unable to provide as much accommodation as conventional policy rules suggest would be appropriate given the weakness in aggregate demand', 'for example david reifschneider and john williams have shown that when policy is constrained by the effective lower bound policymakers can achieve superior economic outcomes by committing to keep the federal funds rate lower for longer than would be called for by the interest rate rules that serve as reasonably reliable guides for monetary policy in more normal times', 'committing to keep the federal funds rate lower for longer helps bring down longerterm interest rates immediately and thereby helps compensate for the inability of policymakers to lower shortterm rates as much as simple rules would call for', 'in normal times the fomc would be expected to tighten monetary policy before unemployment fell as low as  percent', 'under the new thresholds guidance the public is informed that tightening is unlikely as long as unemployment remains above  percent and inflation one to two years out is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the fomcs  percent longerrun goal', 'in the federal reserve bank of new yorks survey of primary dealers for example participants have repeatedly revised downward the unemployment rate at which they anticipate that tightening will first occur', 'the fomc statement therefore notes that in determining how long to maintain a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy the committee will also consider other information including additional measures of labor market conditions indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations and readings on financial developments', 'for example the committee could decide to defer action even after the unemployment rate has declined below  percent if inflation is running and expected to continue at a rate significantly below the committees  percent objective', 'alternatively the committee might judge that the unemployment rate significantly understates the actual degree of labor market slack', 'a decline in the unemployment rate could for example primarily reflect the exit from the labor force of discouraged job seekers', 'as with the guidance for the federal funds rate the committee tied the new program to labor market conditions stating that purchases would continue until there is a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market in a context of price stability', 'by lowering longerterm interest rates these asset purchases are expected to spur spending particularly on interestsensitive purchases such as homes cars and other consumer durables', 'research on the effects of such asset purchases suggests that what matters for the reaction of longerterm interest rates to a purchase program is the extent to which the program leads market participants to change their expectations concerning the entire path of the federal reserves holdings of longerterm securities', 'other things being equal the greater the effect that a purchase program has on the expected path of the federal reserves securities holdings the more substantial should be the downward pressure on the term premium in longerterm interest rates', 'in stating that asset purchases will continue subject to caveats pertaining to efficacy and costs until there has been a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market the fomc established a criterion that differs in three important respects from the forward guidance for the federal funds rate  it is qualitative not quantitative  it refers to an improvement in the outlook for the labor market rather than an improvement in actual labor market conditions and  it requires the committee not only to consider progress toward its employment goal but also to evaluate the efficacy and costs of asset purchases on an ongoing basis', 'federal reserve research concludes that the unemployment rate is probably the best single indicator of current labor market conditions', 'since  periods during which the unemployment rate declined  percentage point or more over two quarters were followed by further declines over the subsequent two quarters about  percent of the time', 'that said the unemployment rate also has its limitations', 'as i noted before the unemployment rate may decline for reasons other than improved labor demand such as when workers become discouraged and drop out of the labor force', 'in addition while movements in the rate tend to be fairly persistent recent history provides several cases in which the unemployment rate fell substantially and then stabilized at stillelevated levels', 'for example between the fourth quarter of  and the first quarter of  the unemployment rate fell  percentage point but was then little changed over the next two quarters', 'similarly the unemployment rate fell  percentage point between the third quarter of  and the first quarter of  only to level off over the subsequent spring and summer', 'to judge whether there has been a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market i therefore expect to consider additional labor market indicators along with the overall outlook for economic growth', 'for example the pace of payroll employment growth is highly correlated with a diverse set of labor market indicators and a decline in unemployment is more likely to signal genuine improvement in the labor market when it is combined with a healthy pace of job gains', 'the payroll employment data however also have shortcomings', 'when the labor department released its annual benchmarking of the establishment survey data last month it revised up its estimate of employment in december  by', 'in addition i am likely to supplement the data on employment and unemployment with measures of gross job flows such as job loss and hiring which describe the underlying dynamics of the labor market', 'for instance layoffs and discharges as a share of total employment have already returned to their prerecession level while the hiring rate remains depressed', 'similarly a pickup in the quit rate which also remains at a low level would signal that workers perceive that their chances to be rehired are goodin other words that labor demand has strengthened', 'i also intend to consider my forecast of the overall pace of spending and growth in the economy', 'a decline in unemployment when it is not accompanied by sufficiently strong growth may not indicate a substantial improvement in the labor market outlook', 'similarly a convincing pickup in growth that is expected to be sustained could prompt a determination that the outlook for the labor market had substantially improved even absent any substantial decline at that point in the unemployment rate', 'such simulations suggest that a hypothetical program involving  billion in longerterm asset purchases would serve to lower the unemployment rate by close to  percentage point within three years while keeping inflation close to the committees  percent objective', 'one issue on which there has been considerable debate is whether low interest rates are doing as much to promote economic growth since the financial crisis as they would have before the financial crisiswhether the interest rate channel of transmission for monetary policy has been attenuated', 'however even if the interest rate channel is less powerful right now than it was before the crisis asset purchases still work to support economic growth through other channels including by boosting stock prices and house values', 'with respect to the federal reserves remittances balance sheet operations are intended to support economic growth and job creation in a context of price stability and not to maximize federal reserve income', 'it is important to note however that any losses that could conceivably occur would not impair the federal reserves conduct of monetary policy', 'though our expanded portfolio of longerterm securities has in recent years translated into substantial earnings and remittances to the treasury the federal reserve has to be sure increased its exposure to interest rate risk by lengthening the average maturity of its securities holdings', 'as the economic recovery strengthens and monetary policy normalizes the federal reserves net interest income will likely decline', 'in particular the federal reserves interest expenses will increase as shortterm interest rates rise while reserve balances initially remain sizable', 'if the purchases provide even a modest boost to economic activity increased tax payments would swamp any reduction in remittances', 'by depressing longerterm interest rates the purchases also hold down the treasurys debt service costs', 'the lower debttogdp ratio mainly reflects stronger tax revenue as a result of morerobust economic activity', 'of course risktaking can go too far thereby threatening future economic performance and a low interest rate environment has the potential to induce investors to take on too much leverage and reach too aggressively for yield', 'at this stage there are some signs that investors are reaching for yield but i do not now see pervasive evidence of trends such as rapid credit growth a marked buildup in leverage or significant asset bubbles that would clearly threaten financial stability', 'with respect to the large financial institutions that it supervises the federal reserve is using a variety of supervisory tools to assess their exposure to and proper management of interest rate risk', 'to the extent that investors are reaching for yield i see the low interest rate environment and not the fomcs asset purchases per se as a contributing factor', 'this weakening in the economic outlook might bring down the expected path of the federal funds rate with the result that longerterm interest rates might not rise appreciably on net', 'that said

ongoing assessment of where we are on the path back to maximum employment and price stability', 'one of the fomcs objectives is to promote a return to maximum employment but exactly what conditions are consistent with maximum employment can be difficult to assess', 'thus far in the recovery and to this day there is little question that the economy has remained far from maximum employment so measurement difficulties were not our focus', 'but as the attainment of our maximum employment goal draws nearer it will be necessary for the fomc to form a more nuanced judgment about when the recovery of the labor market will be materially complete', 'i will refer to the shortfall in employment relative to its mandateconsistent level as labor market slack and there are a number of

how accommodative monetary policy should be', 'is inflation moving back toward  percent', 'a second question that is likely to figure heavily in our assessment of the recovery is whether inflation is moving back toward the fomcs  percent longerrun objective as envisioned in our baseline outlook', 'as the most recent fomc statement emphasizes inflation persistently below  percent could pose risks

back to that level', 'finally the fomc is well aware that inflation could also threaten to rise substantially above  percent', 'at present i rate the chances of this happening as significantly below

pace of asset purchases in further measured steps at future meetings', 'while one of the main motivations for this change was that the unemployment rate might soon cross the  percent threshold the new formulation is also well suited to help the fomc explain policy adjustments that may arise in response to changes in the outlook', 'specifically in determining how long to maintain the current target range of  to  basis points for the federal funds rate the committee will assess progress both realized and expected toward its objectives of maximum employment and  percent inflation', 'in other words the larger the shortfall of employment or inflation from their respective objectives and the slower the projected progress toward those objectives the longer the current target range for the federal funds rate is likely to be maintained', 'the new guidance also reaffirms the fomcs view that decisions about liftoff should not be based on any one indicator but that it will take into account a wide range of information on the labor market inflation and financial developments', 'at present the committee anticipates that economic and financial conditions will likely warrant maintaining the current range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends especially if projected inflation continues to run below the committees  percent longerrun goal and

the potential for conflicts among these objectives', 'but it is important to note that in many ways the pursuit of financial stability is complementary to the goals of price stability and full

to the efficient allocation of resources in the real economy but also to reduced uncertainty and efficient pricing in financial markets which in turn supports financial stability', 'despite these complementarities monetary policy has powerful effects on risk taking', 'this possibility does not obviate the need for monetary policy to focus primarily on price stability and full employmentthe

sensible metrics and that home prices might decline although there was disagreement about how likely such a decline was and how large it might be', 'policymakers failed to anticipate that the reversal of the house price bubble would trigger the most significant financial crisis in the united states since the great depression because that reversal interacted with critical vulnerabilities in the financial system and in government regulation', 'it is not uncommon to hear it suggested that the crisis could have been prevented or significantly mitigated by substantially tighter monetary policy in the mids', 'a tighter monetary policy would not have closed the gaps in the regulatory structure that allowed some sifis and markets to escape comprehensive supervision a tighter monetary policy would not have shifted supervisory attention to a macroprudential perspective and a tighter monetary policy would not have increased the transparency of exotic financial instruments or ameliorated deficiencies in risk measurement and risk management within the private sector', 'some advocates of the view that a substantially tighter monetary policy may have helped prevent the crisis might acknowledge these points but they might also argue that a tighter monetary policy could have limited the rise in house prices the use of leverage within the private sector and the excessive reliance on shortterm funding and that each of these channels would have containedor perhaps even preventedthe worst effects of the crisis', 'a review of the empirical evidence suggests that the level of interest rates does influence house prices leverage and maturity transformation but it is also clear that a tighter monetary policy would have been a very blunt tool substantially mitigating the emerging financial vulnerabilities through higher interest rates would have had sizable adverse effects in terms of higher unemployment', 'in particular a range of studies conclude that tighter

market might have constrained the rise in household leverage as mortgage debt growth would have been slower', 'but the job losses and higher interest payments associated with higher interest rates

desired', 'in addition in december  the committee modified its forward guidance for the federal funds rate stating that as long as the unemployment rate remains above  percent inflation between one

more nuanced because of considerable uncertainty about the level of employment consistent with the federal reserves dual mandate', 'indeed in its  statement on longerrun goals and monetary policy strategy the fomc explicitly recognized that factors determining maximum employment may change over time and may not be directly measurable and that assessments of the level of maximum employment are necessarily uncertain and subject to revision', 'accordingly the reformulated forward guidance reaffirms the fomcs view that policy decisions will not be based on any single indicator but will instead

cyclical and structural influences affecting labor market variables including labor force participation the extent of parttime employment for economic reasons and labor market flows such as the pace of hires and quits', 'consider first the behavior of the labor force participation rate which has declined substantially since the end of the recession even as the unemployment rate has fallen', 'as a consequence the employmenttopopulation ratio has increased far less over the past several years than the unemployment rate alone would indicate based on past experience', 'if the cyclical component is abnormally large relative to the unemployment rate then it might be seen as an additional contributor to labor market slack', 'of these greater worker discouragement is most directly the result of a weak labor market so we could reasonably expect further increases in labor demand to pull a sizable share of discouraged workers back into the workforce', 'at nearly  percent of the labor force the number of such workers is notably larger relative to the unemployment rate than has been typical historically providing another reason why the current level of the unemployment rate may understate the amount of remaining slack in the labor market', 'for example the ongoing shift in employment away from goods production and toward services a sector which historically has used a greater portion of parttime workers may be boosting the share of parttime jobs', 'likewise the continuing decline of middleskill jobs some of which could be replaced by parttime jobs may raise the share of parttime jobs in overall employment', 'despite these challenges in assessing where the share of those employed part time for economic reasons may settle in the long run the sharp runup in involuntary parttime employment during the recession and its slow decline thereafter suggest that cyclical factors are significant', 'given the rise in job vacancies hiring may be poised to pick up but the failure of hiring to rise with vacancies could also indicate that firms perceive the prospects for economic growth as still insufficient to justify adding to payrolls', 'that said the balance of evidence leads me to conclude that weak aggregate demand has contributed significantly to the depressed levels of quits and hires during the recession and in the recovery', 'this broadly based metric supports the conclusion that the labor market has improved significantly over the past year but it also suggests that the decline in the unemployment rate over this period somewhat overstates the improvement in overall labor market conditions', 'over the past several years wage inflation as measured by several different indexes has averaged about  percent and there has been little evidence of any broadbased acceleration in either wages or compensation', 'indeed in real terms wages have been about flat growing less than labor productivity', 'this pattern of subdued real wage gains suggests that nominal compensation could rise more quickly without exerting any meaningful upward pressure on inflation', 'and since wage movements have historically been sensitive to tightness in the labor market the recent behavior of both nominal and real wages point to weaker labor market conditions than would be indicated by the current unemployment rate', 'first the sluggish pace of nominal and real wage growth in recent years may reflect the phenomenon of pentup wage deflation', 'if pentup wage deflation is holding down wage growth the current very moderate wage growth could be a misleading signal of the degree of remaining slack', 'as i noted real wages have been rising less rapidly than productivity implying that real unit labor costs have been declining a pattern suggesting that there is scope for nominal wages to accelerate from their recent pace without creating meaningful inflationary pressure', 'if so productivity growth could continue to outpace real wage gains even when the economy is again operating at its potential', 'a third issue that complicates the interpretation of wage trends is the possibility that because of the dislocations of the great recession transitory wage and price pressures could emerge well before maximum sustainable employment has been reached although they would abate over time as the economy moves back toward maximum employment', 'the argument is that workers who have suffered longterm unemploymentalong with perhaps those who have dropped out of the labor force but would return to work in a stronger economyface significant impediments to reemployment', 'in this case further improvement in the labor market could entail stronger wage pressures for a time before maximum employment has been attained', 'implications of labor market developments for monetary policy the focus of my remarks to this point has been on the functioning of the labor market and how cyclical and structural influences have complicated the task of determining the state of the economy relative to the fomcs objective of maximum employment', 'in my remaining time i will turn to the special challenges that these difficulties in assessing the labor market pose for evaluating the appropriate stance of monetary policy', 'any discussion of appropriate monetary policy must be framed by the federal reserves dual mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability', 'for much of the past five years the fomc has been confronted with an obvious and substantial degree of slack in the labor market and significant risks of slipping into persistent belowtarget inflation', 'so what is a monetary policymaker to do', 'some have argued that in light of the uncertainties associated with estimating labor market slack policymakers should focus mainly on inflation developments in determining appropriate policy', 'to take an extreme case if labor market slack was the dominant and predictable driver of inflation we could largely ignore labor market indicators and look instead at the behavior of inflation to determine the extent of slack in the labor market', 'in present circumstances with inflation still running below the fomcs  percent objective such an approach would suggest that we could maintain policy accommodation until inflation is clearly moving back toward  percent at which point we could also be confident that slack had diminished', 'historically slack has accounted for only a small portion of the fluctuations in inflation', 'indeed unusual aspects of the current recovery may have shifted the leadlag relationship between a tightening labor market and rising inflation pressures in either direction', 'for example as i discussed earlier if downward nominal wage rigidities created a stock of pentup wage deflation during the economic downturn observed wage and price pressures associated with a given amount of slack or pace of reduction in slack might be unusually low for a time', 'if so the first clear signs of inflation pressure could come later than usual in the progression toward maximum employment', 'as a result maintaining a high degree of monetary policy accommodation until inflation pressures emerge could in this case unduly delay the removal of accommodation necessitating an abrupt and potentially disruptive tightening of policy later on', 'conversely profound dislocations in the labor market in recent yearssuch as depressed participation associated with worker discouragement and a stillsubstantial level of longterm unemploymentmay cause inflation pressures to arise earlier than usual as the degree of slack in the labor market declines', 'however some of the resulting wage and price pressures could subsequently ease as higher real wages draw workers back into the labor force and lower longterm unemployment', 'as a consequence tightening monetary policy as soon as inflation moves back toward  percent might in this case prevent labor markets from recovering fully and so would not be consistent with the dual mandate', 'inferring the degree of resource utilization from realtime readings on inflation is further complicated by the familiar challenge of distinguishing transitory price changes from persistent price pressures', 'indeed the recent firming of inflation toward our  percent goal appears to reflect a combination of both factors', 'these complexities in evaluating the relationship between slack and inflation pressures in the current recovery are illustrative of a host of issues that the fomc will be grappling with as the recovery continues', 'as the fomc has noted in its recent policy statements the stance of policy will be guided by our assessments of how far we are from our objectives of maximum employment and  percent inflation as well as our assessment of the likely pace of progress toward those objectives', 'given this assessment and the committees expectation that inflation will gradually move up toward its longerrun objective the committee reaffirmed its view that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time after our current asset purchase program ends especially if projected inflation continues to run below the committees  percent longerrun goal and provided that longerterm inflation expectations remain well anchored', 'but if progress in the labor market continues to be more rapid than anticipated by the committee or if inflation moves up more rapidly than anticipated resulting in faster convergence toward our dual objectives then increases in the federal funds rate target could come sooner than the committee currently expects and could be more rapid thereafter', 'of course if economic performance turns out to be disappointing and progress

from the continued stability of survey measures of longerrun inflation expectations', 'and although marketbased measures of inflation compensation have declined appreciably since last summer and bear close watching i suspect that these declines are primarily driven by changes in risk premiums and market factors that i expect to prove transitory', 'on balance i therefore think it is appropriate for

influence the pace of real wage growth over time', 'these factors which are outside of the federal reserves control likely explain why real wages have failed to keep pace with productivity growth for at least the past  years', 'for such reasons we can never be sure what growth rate of nominal wages is consistent with stable consumer price inflation and this uncertainty limits the usefulness of wage trends as an indicator of the feds progress in achieving its inflation objective', 'i have argued that a pickup in neither wage nor price inflation is indispensable for me to achieve reasonable confidence that inflation will move back to  percent over time', 'that said i would be uncomfortable raising the federal funds rate if readings on wage growth core consumer prices and other indicators of underlying inflation pressures were to weaken if marketbased measures of inflation compensation were to fall appreciably further or if surveybased measures were to begin to decline noticeably',

earlier how are economic and financial considerations likely to shape the course of monetary policy over the next few years', 'rather the actual path of policy will evolve as economic conditions evolve and policy tightening could speed up slow down pause or even reverse course depending on actual and expected developments in real activity and inflation', 'reflecting such data dependence as well as some historically unusual policy considerations that i will discuss shortly the average pace of tightening observed during previous recoveries could well provide a highly misleading guide to the actual course of monetary policy over the next few years', 'our goal in adjusting the federal funds rate over time will be to achieve and sustain economic conditions close to maximum employment

is always data dependent what can we say about the appropriate path of policy assuming the most likely outcomes for real activity inflation and related factors', 'as i noted at my press conference after last weeks fomc meeting participants generally project that the unemployment rate will continue to fall through late  to levels at or somewhat below estimates of its longerrun sustainable level

percent in the fomcs recent projections', 'provided that inflation shows clear signs over time of moving up toward  percent in the context of continuing progress toward maximum employment i therefore expect that a further tightening in monetary policy after the first increase in the federal funds rate will be warranted', 'as i noted my fomc colleagues and i generally anticipate that a rather gradual rise in the federal funds rate will be appropriate over the next few years conditional on our baseline forecasts for real activity inflation and other aspects of the economys performance', 'keeping in mind that the actual course of monetary policy in the future will primarily depend on events as they unfold i see three additional considerations that are relevant', 'the first which is closely related to my expectation that the headwinds holding back growth are likely to continue to abate gradually pertains to the risk that the equilibrium real federal funds rate may not in fact recover as much or as quickly as i anticipate', 'substantial uncertainty surrounds all estimates of the equilibrium real interest rate and as i will discuss momentarily market participants appear to be fairly pessimistic about the odds that it will rise significantly over time', 'moreover some recent studies have raised the prospect that the economies of the united states and other countries will grow more slowly in the future as a result of both demographic factors and a slower pace of productivity gains from technological advances', 'at an extreme such developments could even amount to a type of secular stagnation in which monetary policy would need to keep real interest rates persistently quite low relative to historical norms to promote full employment and price stability absent a highly expansive fiscal policy', 'such a risk has important implications for monetary policy in the near term when the ability of the economy to adjust to significant rate increases will be especially uncertain', 'the experience of japan over the past  years and sweden more recently demonstrates that a tightening of policy when the equilibrium real rate remains low can result in appreciable economic costs delaying the attainment of a central banks price stability objective', 'international experience therefore counsels caution in removing accommodation until the committee is more confident that aggregate demand will continue to expand in line with its expectationsa view that is also supported by the research literature', 'a second reason for the committee to proceed cautiously in removing policy accommodation relates to asymmetries in the effectiveness of monetary policy in the vicinity of the zero lower bound', 'in the event that growth in employment and overall activity proves unexpectedly robust and inflation moves significantly above our  percent objective the fomc can and will raise interest rates as needed to rein in inflation', 'but if growth was to falter and inflation was to fall yet further the effective lower bound on nominal interest rates could limit the committees ability to provide the needed degree of accommodation', 'research suggests that the higher the probability of monetary policy becoming constrained by the zero lower bound in the near future because of adverse shocks and the more severe the attendant consequences for real activity and inflation the more current policy should lean in accommodative direction', 'in effect such a strategy represents insurance against the zero lower bound by aiming for somewhat stronger real activity and a faster rise in inflation under the modal outlook', 'given the modal outlook envisioned in fomc participants recent forecasts with headwinds continuing to diminish the equilibrium real rate rising and inflation moving back up to  percent over the next few years the risk that the funds rate would need to return to near zero should be declining appreciably', 'consistent with this assessment almost all fomc participants now view the risks to the outlook for real activity as largely balanced although some also see inflation risks as weighted to the downside', 'in addition both the remarkably low level of longterm government bond yields in advanced economies and the low prevailing level of inflation compensation suggest that financial market participants may hold more pessimistic views than fomc participants concerning the risks to the global outlook', 'since longterm yields reflect the markets probabilityweighted average of all possible shortterm interest rate paths along with compensating term and risk premiums the generally low level of yields in advanced economies suggests that investors place considerable odds on adverse scenarios that would necessitate a lower and flatter trajectory of the federal funds than envisioned in participants modal sep projections', 'a final argument for gradually adjusting policy relates to the desirability of achieving a prompt return of inflation to the fomcs  percent goal an objective that would be advanced by allowing the unemployment rate to decline for a time somewhat below estimates of its longerrun sustainable level', 'proceeding too slowly to tighten policy could have adverse consequences for the attainment of the committees inflation objective over time especially if it were to undermine the fomcs inflation credibility', 'inflation could for example exhibit nonlinear dynamics in which high levels of unemployment place relatively little downward pressure on inflation but tight labor markets generate marked upward pressure', 'if so a decline in unemployment below its natural rate could cause inflation to quickly rise to an undesirably high level', 'rapid increases in shortterm interest rates to arrest such an unwelcome development could in turn have adverse effects on financial markets and the broader economy', 'we cannot be certain about the underlying strength of the expansion the maximum level of employment consistent with price stability or the longerrun level of interest rates consistent with maximum employment', 'nothing about the course of the committees actions is predetermined except the committees commitment to promote our dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability']"

consumer price inflation has been close to zero over the past year in large part because the big drop in crude oil prices since last summer has pushed down prices for gasoline and other consumer energy products', 'price inflation excluding the volatile categories of energy and food prices or socalled core inflation is often a better indicator of future overall inflation', 'the recent low level of core inflation . percent over the past  months partly reflects the appreciation of the foreign exchange value of the u.s. dollar during the second half of last year as global financial markets seemed to judge that our economy was relatively stronger than those of many of our trading partners', 'the stronger dollar has pushed down the prices of imported goods and that in turn has put downward pressure on core inflation', 'in addition the plunge in oil prices may have had some indirect effects in holding down the prices of nonenergy items in core inflation as producers passed on to their customers some of the cost savings from lower energy prices', 'in all however these downward pressures seem to be abating and the effects of these transitory factors are expected to fall out of measures of inflation by early next year', 'very low inflation may not sound like a real problem to many people', 'however persistently low price inflation which can tend to slow the pace of wage increases over time can weaken the economy by for example making it more difficult for households and firms to pay off their debts', 'a persistent very low inflation environment also tends to result in chronically low shortterm interest rates', 'this type of situation would leave less scope for the fomc to respond with its conventional monetary policy toolnamely a cut in the federal funds rateto counteract a weakening in the economy', 'in particular the higher foreign exchange value of the dollar that i mentioned as well as weak growth in some foreign economies has restrained the demand for u.s. exports', 'moreover lower crude oil prices have significantly depressed business investment in the domestic energy sector', 'we expect the drag on domestic economic activity from these factors to ease over the course of this year as the value of the dollar and crude oil prices stabilize and i anticipate moderate economic growth on balance for this year as a whole', 'looking further ahead i think that many of the fundamental factors underlying u.s. economic activity are solid and should lead to some pickup in the pace of economic growth in the coming years', 'in particular i anticipate that employment will continue to expand and the unemployment rate will decline further', 'an improving job market should in turn help support a faster pace of household spending growth', 'additional jobs and potentially faster wage growth bolster household incomes and lower energy prices mean consumers have more money to spend on other goods and services', 'in addition growing employment and wages should make consumers more comfortable in spending a greater portion of their incomes than they have been in the aftermath of the great recession', 'moreover increases in house values and stock market prices along with reductions in debt in recent years have pushed up households net worth which also should support more spending', 'finally interest rates faced by borrowers remain low reflecting the fomcs highly accommodative monetary policies', 'another positive factor for the outlook is that the drag on economic growth in recent years from changes in federal fiscal policies appears to have waned', 'temporary fiscal stimulus measures supported economic output during the recession and early in the recovery but those stimulus measures have since expired and additional policy actions were taken to reduce the federal budget deficit', 'by  these changes in fiscal policies were holding back economic growth', 'there are a couple of factors however that i expect could restrain economic growth', 'a second factor that could restrain economic growth regards housing', 'while national home prices have been rising for a few years and home sales have improved recently residential construction has remained quite soft', 'many households still find it difficult to obtain mortgage credit but more generally the weak job market and slow wage gains in recent years appear to have induced people to doubleup on housing', 'population growth is creating a need for more housing whether to rent or to own and i do expect that continuing job and wage gains will encourage more people to form new households', 'regarding inflation as i mentioned earlier the recent effects of lower prices for crude oil and for imports on overall inflation are expected to wane during this year', 'combined with further tightening in labor and product markets i expect inflation will move toward the fomcs  percent objective over the next few years', 'importantly a number of different surveys indicate that longerterm inflation expectations have remained stable even as recent readings on inflation have fallen', 'if inflation expectations had not remained stable i would be more concerned because consumer and business expectations about inflation can become selffulfilling', 'implications for monetary policy my own outlook for the economy and inflation is broadly consistent with the central tendency of the projections submitted by fomc participants at the time of our june meeting', 'based on my outlook i expect that it will be appropriate at some point later this year to take the first step to raise the federal funds rate and thus begin normalizing monetary policy', 'but i want to emphasize that the course of the economy and inflation remains highly uncertain and unanticipated developments could delay or accelerate this first step', 'we will be watching carefully to see if there is continued improvement in labor market conditions and we will need to be reasonably confident that inflation will move back to  percent in the next few years', 'because there are some factors which i mentioned earlier that continue to restrain the economic expansion i currently anticipate that the appropriate pace of normalization will be gradual and that monetary policy will need to be highly supportive of economic activity for quite some time', 'but again both the course of the economy and inflation are uncertain', 'if progress toward our employment and inflation goals is more rapid than expected it may be appropriate to remove monetary policy accommodation more quickly', 'longrun economic growth before i conclude let me very briefly place my discussion of the economic outlook into a longerterm context', 'the federal reserve contributes to the nations economic performance in part by using monetary policy to help achieve our mandated goals of maximum employment and price stability', 'but success in promoting these objectives does not by itself ensure a strong pace of longrun economic growth or substantial improvements in future living standards', 'the most important factor determining continued advances in living standards is productivity growth defined as the rate of increase in how much a worker can produce in an hour of work', 'over time sustained increases in productivity are necessary to support rising household incomes', 'the growth rate of output per hour worked in the business sector has averaged about  percent per year since the recession began in late  and has been essentially flat over the past year', 'in contrast annual productivity gains averaged  percent over the decade preceding the great recession', 'i mentioned earlier the sluggish pace of wage gains in recent years and while i do think that this is evidence of some persisting labor market slack it also may reflect at least in part fairly weak productivity growth', 'there are many unanswered questions about what has slowed productivity growth in recent years and about the prospects for productivity growth in the longer run', 'but we do know that productivity ultimately depends on many factors including our workforces knowledge and skills along with the quantity and quality of the capital equipment technology and infrastructure that they have to work with', 'as a general principle the american people would be well served by the active

states since the s highlighting two key points that inflation is now much more stable than it used to be and that it is currently running at a very low level', 'i will then consider the costs associated with inflation and why these costs suggest that the federal reserve should try to keep inflation close to  percent', 'after briefly reviewing our policy actions since the financial crisis i will discuss the dynamics of inflation and their implications for the outlook and monetary policy', 'historical review of inflation a crucial responsibility of any central bank is to control inflation the average rate of increase in the prices of a broad group of goods and services', 'keeping inflation stable at a moderately low level is important because for reasons i will discuss inflation that is high excessively low or unstable imposes significant costs on households and businesses', 'as a result inflation control is one half of the dual mandate that congress has laid down for the federal reserve which is to pursue maximum employment and stable prices', 'the federal reserve has not always been successful in fulfilling the price stability element of its mandate', 'the dashed red line in figure  plots the fourquarter percent change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures pcethe measure of inflation that the feds policymaking body the federal open market committee or fomc uses to define its longerrun inflation goal', 'starting in the mids inflation began to move higher', 'large jumps in food and energy prices played a role in this upward move but they were not the whole story for as illustrated here inflation was already moving up before the food and energy shocks hit in the s and the early s', 'and if we look at core inflation the solid black line which excludes food and energy prices we see that it too starts to move higher in the mids and rises to very elevated levels during the s which strongly suggests that something more than the energy and food price shocks must have been at work', 'a second important feature of inflation over this period can be seen if we examine an estimate of its longterm trend which is plotted as the dotted black line in figure', 'at each point in time this trend is defined as the prediction from a statistical model of the level to which inflation is projected to return in the long run once the effects of any shocks to the economy have fully played out', 'as can be seen from the figure this estimated trend drifts higher over the s and s implying that during this period there was no stable anchor to which inflation could be expected to eventually returna conclusion generally supported by other procedures for estimating trend inflation', 'today many economists believe that these features of inflation in the late s and sits high level and lack of a stable anchorreflected a combination of factors including chronically overheated labor and product markets the effects of the energy and food price shocks and the emergence of an inflationary psychology whereby a rise in actual inflation led people to revise up their expectations for future inflation', 'together these various factors caused inflationactual and expectedto ratchet higher over time', 'ultimately however monetary policy bears responsibility for the broad contour of what happened to actual and expected inflation during this period because the federal reserve was insufficiently focused on returning inflation to a predictable low level following the shocks to food and energy prices and other disturbances', 'in late  the federal reserve began significantly tightening monetary policy to reduce inflation', 'in response to this tightening which precipitated a severe economic downturn in the early s overall inflation moved persistently lower averaging less than  percent from  to', 'inflation came down further following the  recession and subsequent slow recovery and then averaged about  percent for many years', 'since the recession ended in  however the united states has experienced inflation running appreciably below the fomcs  percent objective in part reflecting the gradual pace of the subsequent economic recovery', 'examining the behavior of inflations estimated longterm trend reveals another important change in inflation dynamics', 'with the caveat that these results are based on a specific implementation of a particular statistical model they imply that since the mids there have been no persistent movements in this predicted longrun inflation rate which has remained very close to  percent', 'remarkably this stability is estimated to have continued during and after the recent severe recession which saw the unemployment rate rise to levels comparable to those seen during the  downturn when the trend did shift down markedly', 'as i will discuss the stability of this trend appears linked to a change in the behavior of longrun inflation expectationsmeasures of which appear to be much better anchored today than in the past likely reflecting an improvement in the conduct of monetary policy', 'in any event this empirical analysis implies that over the past  years inflation has been much more predictable over the longer term than it was back in the s because the trend rate to which inflation was predicted to return no longer moved around appreciably', 'that said inflation still varied considerably from year to year in response to various shocks', 'as figure  highlights the united states has experienced very low inflation on average since the financial crisis in part reflecting persistent economic weakness that has proven difficult to fully counter with monetary policy', 'overall inflation shown as the dashed red line has averaged only about  percent per year since  and is currently close to zero', 'this result is not merely a product of falling energy prices as core inflation the solid black line has also been low on average over this period', 'inflation costs in  the fomc adopted for the first time an explicit longerrun inflation objective of  percent as measured by the pce price index', 'other central banks including the european central bank and the bank of england also have a  percent inflation target', 'this decision reflected the fomcs judgment that inflation that persistently deviatesup or downfrom a fixed low level can be costly in a number of ways', 'persistent high inflation induces households and firms to spend time and effort trying to minimize their cash holdings and forces businesses to adjust prices more frequently than would otherwise be necessary', 'more importantly high inflation also tends to raise the aftertax cost of capital thereby discouraging business investment', 'these adverse effects occur because capital depreciation allowances and other aspects of our tax system are only partially indexed for inflation', 'persistently high inflation if unanticipated can be especially costly for households that rely on pensions annuities and longterm bonds to provide a significant portion of their retirement income', 'because the income provided by these assets is typically fixed in nominal terms its real purchasing power may decline surprisingly quickly if inflation turns out to be consistently higher than originally anticipated with potentially serious consequences for retirees standard of living as they age', 'an unexpected rise in inflation also tends to reduce the real purchasing power of labor income for a time because nominal wages and salaries are generally slow to adjust to movements in the overall level of prices', 'survey data suggest that this effect is probably the number one reason why people dislike inflation so much', 'in the longer run however real wagesthat is wages adjusted for inflationappear to be largely independent of the average rate of inflation and instead are primarily determined by productivity global competition and other nonmonetary factors', 'in support of this view figure  shows that nominal wage growth tends to broadly track price inflation over long periods of time', 'inflation that is persistently very low can also be costly and it is such costs that have been particularly relevant to monetary policymakers in recent years', 'the most important cost is that very low inflation constrains a central banks ability to combat recessions', 'these reductions current and expected stimulate spending and hiring by lowering longerterm real interest ratesthat is nominal rates adjusted for inflationand improving financial conditions more broadly', 'but the federal funds rate and other nominal interest rates cannot go much below zero since holding cash is always an alternative to investing in securities', 'thus the lowest the fomc can feasibly push the real federal funds rate is essentially the negative value of the inflation rate', 'as a result the federal reserve has less room to ease monetary policy when inflation is very low', 'this limitation is a potentially serious problem because severe downturns such as the great recession may require pushing real interest rates far below zero for an extended period to restore full employment at a satisfactory pace', 'for this reason pursuing too low an inflation objective or otherwise tolerating persistently very low inflation would be inconsistent with the other leg of the fomcs mandate to promote maximum employment', 'an unexpected decline in inflation that is sizable and persistent can also be costly because it increases the debt burdens of borrowers', 'consider homeowners who take out a conventional fixedrate mortgage with the expectation that inflation will remain close to  percent and their nominal incomes will rise about  percent per year', 'moreover if house prices fall in line with consumer prices rather than rising as expected then the equity in their home will be lower than they had anticipated', 'monetary policy actions since the financial crisis as i noted earlier after weighing the costs associated with various rates of inflation the fomc decided that  percent inflation is an appropriate operational definition of its longerrun price objective', 'in the wake of the  financial crisis however achieving both this objective and full employment the other leg of the federal reserves dual mandate has been difficult as shown in figure', 'initially the unemployment rate the solid black line soared and inflation the dashed red line fell sharply', 'moreover after the recession officially ended in  the subsequent recovery was significantly slowed by a variety of persistent headwinds including households with underwater mortgages and high debt burdens reduced access to credit for many potential borrowers constrained spending by state and local governments and weakened foreign growth prospects', 'in an effort to return employment and inflation to levels consistent with the federal reserves dual mandate the fomc took a variety of unprecedented actions to help lower longerterm interest rates including reducing the federal funds rate the dotted black line to near zero communicating to the public that shortterm interest rates would likely stay exceptionally low for some time and buying large quantities of longerterm treasury debt and agencyissued mortgagebacked securities', 'the unemployment rate which peaked at  percent in  is now . percent slightly above the median of fomc participants current estimates of its longerrun normal level', 'although other indicators suggest that the unemployment rate currently understates how much slack remains in the labor market on balance the economy is no longer far away from full employment', 'in contrast inflation has continued to run below the committees objective over the past several years and over the past  months it has been essentially zero', 'nevertheless the committee expects that inflation will gradually return to  percent over the next two or three years', 'i will now turn to the determinants of inflation and the factors that underlie this expectation', 'inflation dynamics models used to describe and predict inflation commonly distinguish between changes in food and energy priceswhich enter into total inflationand movements in the prices of other goods and servicesthat is core inflation', 'this decomposition is useful because food and energy prices can be extremely volatile with fluctuations that often depend on factors that are beyond the influence of monetary policy such as technological or political developments in the case of energy prices or weather or disease in the case of food prices', 'as a result core inflation usually provides a better indicator than total inflation of where total inflation is headed in the medium term', 'of course food and energy account for a significant portion of household budgets so the federal reserves inflation objective is defined in terms of the overall change in consumer prices', 'what then determines core inflation', 'recalling figure  core inflation tends to fluctuate around a longerterm trend that now is essentially stable', 'economic theory suggests and empirical analysis confirms that such deviations of inflation from trend depend partly on the intensity of resource utilization in the economyas approximated for example by the gap between the actual unemployment rate and its socalled natural rate or by the shortfall of actual gross domestic product gdp from potential output', 'this relationshipwhich likely reflects among other things a tendency for firms costs to rise as utilization rates increaserepresents an important channel through which monetary policy influences inflation over the medium term although in practice the influence is modest and gradual', 'movements in certain types of input costs particularly changes in the price of imported goods also can cause core inflation to deviate noticeably from its trend sometimes by a marked amount from year to year', 'finally a nontrivial fraction of the quartertoquarter and even the yeartoyear variability of inflation is attributable to idiosyncratic and often unpredictable shocks', 'what about the determinants of inflations longerterm trend', 'here it is instructive to compare the purely statistical estimate of the trend rate of future inflation shown earlier in figure  with survey measures of peoples actual expectations of longrun inflation as is done in figure', 'theory suggests that inflation expectationswhich presumably are linked to the central banks inflation goalshould play an important role in actual price setting', 'indeed the contours of these series are strikingly similar which suggests that the estimated trend in inflation is in fact related to households and firms longrun inflation expectations', 'to summarize this analysis suggests that economic slack changes in imported goods prices and idiosyncratic shocks all cause core inflation to deviate from a longerterm trend that is ultimately determined by longrun inflation expectations', 'as some will recognize this model of core inflation is a variant of a theoretical model that is commonly referred to as an expectationsaugmented phillips curve', 'total inflation in turn reflects movements in core inflation combined with changes in the prices of food and energy', 'an important feature of this model of inflation dynamics is that the overall effect that variations in resource utilization import prices and other factors will have on inflation depends crucially on whether these influences also affect longrun inflation expectations', 'figure  illustrates this point with a stylized example of the inflation consequences of a gradual increase in the level of import pricesperhaps occurring in response to stronger real activity abroad or a fall in the exchange value of the dollarthat causes the rate of change of import prices to be elevated for a time', 'first consider the situation shown in panel a in which households and firms expectations of inflation are not solidly anchored but instead adjust in response to the rates of inflation that are actually observed', 'such conditionswhich arguably prevailed in the united states from the s to the midscould plausibly arise if the central bank has in the past allowed significant and persistent movements in inflation to occur', 'in this case the temporary rise in the rate of change of import prices results in a permanent increase in inflation', 'this shift occurs because the initial increase in inflation generated by a period of rising import prices leads households and firms to revise up their expectations of future inflation', 'a permanent rise in inflation would also result from a sustained rise in the level of oil prices or a temporary increase in resource utilization', 'by contrast suppose that inflation expectations are instead well anchored perhaps because the central bank has been successful over time in keeping inflation near some specified target and has made it clear to the public that it intends to continue to do so', 'then the response of inflation to a temporary increase in the rate of change of import prices or any other transitory shock will resemble the pattern shown in panel b', 'in this case inflation will deviate from its longerterm level only as long as import prices are rising', 'but once they level out inflation will fall back to its previous trend in the absence of other disturbances', 'a key implication of these two examples is that the presence of wellanchored inflation expectations greatly enhances a central banks ability to pursue both of its objectivesnamely price stability and full employment', 'because temporary shifts in the rate of change of import prices or other transitory shocks have no permanent influence on expectations they have only a transitory effect on inflation', 'as a result the central bank can look through such shortrun inflationary disturbances in setting monetary policy allowing it to focus on returning the economy to full employment without placing price stability at risk', 'indeed the federal reserve has done just that in setting monetary policy over the past decade or more', 'moreover as i will discuss shortly these inflation dynamics are a key reason why the fomc expects inflation to return to  percent over the next few years', 'on balance the evidence suggests that inflation expectations are in fact well anchored at present', 'figure  plots the two survey measures of longerterm expected inflation i presented earlier along with a measure of longerterm inflation compensation derived as the difference between yields on nominal treasury securities and inflationindexed ones called tips', 'since the late s survey measures of longerterm inflation expectations have been quite stable this stability has persisted in recent years despite a deep recession and concerns expressed by some observers regarding the potential inflationary effects of unconventional monetary policy', 'the fact that these survey measures appear to have remained anchored at about the same levels that prevailed prior to the recession suggests that once the economy has returned to full employment and absent any other shocks core inflation should return to its prerecession average level of about  percent', 'this conclusion is tempered somewhat by recent movements in longerrun inflation compensation which in principle could reflect changes in investors expectations for longrun inflation', 'however movements in inflation compensation are difficult to interpret because they can be driven by factors that are unique to financial marketssuch as movements in liquidity or risk premiumsas well as by changes in expected inflation', 'indeed empirical work that attempts to control for these factors suggests that the longrun inflation expectations embedded in asset prices have in fact moved down relatively little over the past decade', 'nevertheless the decline in inflation compensation over the past year may indicate that financial market participants now see an increased risk of very low inflation persisting', 'although the evidence on balance suggests that inflation expectations are well anchored at present policymakers would be unwise to take this situation for granted', 'anchored inflation expectations were not won easily or quickly experience suggests that it takes many years of carefully conducted monetary policy to alter what households and firms perceive to be inflations normal behavior and furthermore that a persistent failure to keep inflation under controlby letting it drift either too high or too low for too longcould cause expectations to once again become unmoored', 'given that inflation has been running below the fomcs objective for several years now such concerns reinforce the appropriateness of the federal reserves current monetary policy which remains highly accommodative by historical standards and is directed toward helping return inflation to  percent over the medium term', 'before turning to the implications of this inflation model for the current outlook and monetary policy a cautionary note is in order', 'the phillipscurve approach to forecasting inflation has a long history in economics and it has usefully informed monetary policy decisionmaking around the globe', 'moreover inflation sometimes moves in ways that empirical versions of the model which necessarily are a simplified version of a complicated reality cannot adequately explain', 'policy implications assuming that my reading of the data is correct and longrun inflation expectations are in fact anchored near their prerecession levels what implications does the preceding description of inflation dynamics have for the inflation outlook and for monetary policy', 'this framework suggests first that much of the recent shortfall of inflation from our  percent objective is attributable to special factors whose effects are likely to prove transitory', 'as the solid black line in figure  indicates pce inflation has run noticeably below our  percent objective on average since  with the shortfall approaching about  percentage point in both  and  and more than  percentage points this year', 'the stacked bars in the figure give the contributions of various factors to these deviations from  percent computed using an estimated version of the simple inflation model i just discussed', 'as the solid blue portion of the bars shows falling consumer energy prices explain about half of this years shortfall and a sizable portion of the  and  shortfalls as well', 'another important source of downward pressure this year has been a decline in import prices the portion with orange checkerboard pattern which is largely attributable to the  percent appreciation in the dollars exchange value over the past year', 'finally a similarly small portion of the current shortfall of inflation from  percent is explained by other factors which include changes in food prices importantly the effects of these other factors are transitory and often switch sign from year to year', 'although an accounting exercise like this one is always imprecise and will depend on the specific model that is used i think its basic messagethat the current nearzero rate of inflation can mostly be attributed to the temporary effects of falling prices for energy and nonenergy importsis quite plausible', 'if so the month change in total pce prices is likely to rebound to  percent or higher in  barring a further substantial drop in crude oil prices and provided that the dollar does not appreciate noticeably further', 'to be reasonably confident that inflation will return to  percent over the next few years we need in turn to be reasonably confident that we will see continued solid economic growth and further gains in resource utilization with longerterm inflation expectations remaining near their prerecession level', 'even so further improvement in labor market conditions would be welcome because we are probably not yet all the way back to full employment', 'although the unemployment rate may now be close to its longerrun normal levelwhich most fomc participants now estimate is around . percentthis traditional metric of resource utilization almost certainly understates the actual amount of slack that currently exists on a cyclically adjusted basis the labor force participation rate remains low relative to its underlying trend and an unusually large number of people are working part time but would prefer fulltime employment', 'reducing slack along these other dimensions may involve a temporary decline in the unemployment rate somewhat below the level that is estimated to be consistent in the longer run with inflation stabilizing at  percent', 'for example attracting discouraged workers back into the labor force may require a period of especially plentiful employment opportunities and strong hiring', 'beyond these considerations a modest decline in the unemployment rate below its longrun level for a time would by increasing resource utilization also have the benefit of speeding the return to  percent inflation', 'consistent with the inflation framework i have outlined the medians of the projections provided by fomc participants at our recent meeting show inflation gradually moving back to  percent accompanied by a temporary decline in unemployment slightly below the median estimate of the rate expected to prevail in the longer run', 'these projections embody two key judgments regarding the projected relationship between real activity and interest rates', 'first the real federal funds rate is currently somewhat below the level that would be consistent with real gdp expanding in line with potential which implies that the unemployment rate is likely to continue to fall in the absence of some tightening', 'second participants implicitly expect that the various headwinds to economic growth that i mentioned earlier will continue to fade thereby boosting the economys underlying strength', 'combined these two judgments imply that the real interest rate consistent with achieving and then maintaining full employment in the medium run should rise gradually over time', 'this expectation coupled with inherent lags in the response of real activity and inflation to changes in monetary policy are the key reasons that most of my colleagues and i anticipate that it will likely be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate sometime later this year and to continue boosting shortterm rates at a gradual pace thereafter as the labor market improves further and inflation moves back to our  percent objective', 'what matters for overall financial conditions is the entire trajectory of shortterm interest rates that is anticipated by markets and the public', 'as i noted most of my colleagues and i anticipate that economic conditions are likely to warrant raising shortterm interest rates at a quite gradual pace over the next few years', 'its important to emphasize however that both the timing of the first rate increase and any subsequent adjustments to our federal funds rate target will depend on how developments in the economy influence the committees outlook for progress toward maximum employment and  percent inflation', 'the economic outlook of course is highly uncertain and it is conceivable for example that inflation could remain appreciably below our  percent target despite the apparent anchoring of inflation expectations', 'here japans recent history may be instructive as shown in figure  survey measures of longerterm expected inflation in that country remained positive and stable even as that country experienced many years of persistent mild deflation', 'the explanation for the persistent divergence between actual and expected inflation in japan is not clear but i believe that it illustrates a problem faced by all central banks economists understanding of the dynamics of inflation is far from perfect', 'accordingly inflation may rise more slowly or rapidly than the committee currently anticipates should such a development occur we would need to adjust the stance of policy in response', 'considerable uncertainties also surround the outlook for economic activity', 'moreover net exports have served as a significant drag on growth over the past year and recent global economic and financial developments highlight the risk that a slowdown in foreign growth might restrain u.s. economic activity somewhat further', 'that said in response to surprises affecting the outlook for economic activity as with those affecting inflation the fomc would need to adjust the stance of policy so that our actions remain consistent with inflation returning to our  percent objective over the medium term in the context of maximum employment', 'given the highly uncertain nature of the outlook one might ask why not hold off raising the federal funds rate until the economy has reached full employment and inflation is actually back at  percent', 'the difficulty with this strategy is that monetary policy affects real activity and inflation with a substantial lag', 'in addition continuing to hold shortterm interest rates near zero well after real activity has returned to normal and headwinds have faded could encourage excessive leverage and other forms of inappropriate risktaking that might undermine financial stability', 'conclusion to conclude let me emphasize that following the dual mandate established by the congress the federal reserve is committed to the achievement of maximum employment and price stability', 'to this end we have maintained a highly accommodative monetary policy since the financial crisis that policy has fostered a marked improvement in labor market conditions and helped check undesirable disinflationary pressures', 'however we have not yet fully attained our objectives under the dual mandate some slack remains in labor markets and the effects of this slack and the influence of lower energy prices and past dollar appreciation have been significant factors keeping inflation below our goal', 'but i expect that inflation will return to  percent over the next few years as the temporary factors that are currently weighing on inflation wane provided that economic growth continues to be strong enough to complete the return to maximum employment

an unpredictable manner over many years then even financially sophisticated households and firms may not be able to avoid significant forecasting errors with their attendant costs', 'such costs can arise in a wide variety of situations for instance any firm union or other entity that engages in a multiyear nominal contract may be adversely affected by unexpected increases or decreases in inflation although those on the other side of the contract might benefit', 'as a result several foreign central banks have found it possible to push nominal shortterm interest rates somewhat below zero', 'of course the fomc was able to use other policy tools such as largescale asset purchases to put additional downward pressure on longterm interest rates after the nominal funds rate was cut to near zero however those policies had potential costs and risks that made them an imperfect substitute for traditional interest rate policy', 'see krugman  reifschneider and williams  and eggertsson and woodford  for discussions of the effects that low inflation and the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates have on a central banks ability to stimulate the economy during economic downturns', 'very low inflation also can result in chronically higher unemployment by closing off an important way in which the labor market can respond to adverse shocks', 'in sectors where productivity is lagging or demand is slowing declines in real wages might be necessary to avoid even worse outcomes such as layoffs', 'inflation is therefore often said to grease the wheels of the labor market because it permits these required adjustments in real wages to occur through a combination of unchanged nominal wages and rising prices', 'but when inflation falls to a very low level this passive approach to wage reductions may no longer be viable for many firms causing relatively more of the burden of adjustment to fall on employment', 'blanchard dellariccia and mauro  among others have recently suggested that central banks should consider raising their inflation targets on the grounds that conditions since the financial crisis have demonstrated that monetary policy is more constrained by the effective lower bound elb on nominal interest rates than was originally estimated', 'in addition it is not obvious that a modestly higher target rate of inflation would have greatly increased the federal reserves ability to support real activity in the special conditions that prevailed in the wake of the financial crisis when some of the channels through which lower interest rates stimulate aggregate spending such as housing construction were probably attenuated', 'beyond these tactical considerations however changing the fomcs longrun inflation objective would risk calling into question the fomcs commitment to stabilizing inflation at any level because it might lead people to suspect that the target could be changed opportunistically in the future', 'if so then the key benefits of stable inflation expectations discussed belowan increased ability of monetary policy to fight economic downturns without sacrificing price stabilitymight be lost', 'moreover if the purpose of a higher inflation target is to increase the ability of central banks to deal with the severe recessions that follow financial crises then a better strategic approach might be to rely on more vigorous supervisory and macroprudential policies to reduce the likelihood of such events', 'finally targeting inflation in the vicinity of  percent or higher would stretch the meaning of stable prices in the federal reserve act', 'for a more complete listing of the federal reserves policy actions in recent years see the federal reserves response to the financial crisis and action to foster maximum employment and price stability a webpage available on the boards website', 'several other approaches are commonly used to abstract from the shortterm volatility of overall inflation and thereby better discern its mediumterm direction', 'for example one procedure removes the components of the total pce price index with the largest or smallest price changes before computing the average price change yielding the trimmed mean pce index another uses the median price change in a given period rather than the mean change to represent the overall inflation rate', 'in practice simply using core inflation does about as well in predicting overall inflation over the coming year and beyond as these alternative procedures see detmeister', 'another input cost that can affect core inflation is the price of energy in recent decades however the passthrough of energy price changes to core inflation appears much smaller than in previous periods see hooker  clark and terry', 'some of these idiosyncratic shocks are related to identifiable factors such as changes in medicare reimbursement rates or movements in the imputed price of holding a checking account', 'both of these factors are included in the services component of the pce price index but not the consumer price index cpi', 'most theoretical versions of the phillips curve suggest that inflation should depend on shortrun inflation expectations but as an empirical matter measures of longrun expectations appear to explain the data better', 'see clark and davig  see also faust and wright  who make a related point in the context of inflation forecasting', 'note that the question about expected inflation in the university of michigan surveys of consumers is not phrased in terms of a specific measure of prices so its levelas opposed to its contourcannot be directly compared with a particular measure of inflation such as the change in the pce price index', 'theoretical descriptions of the inflation process remain an active area of research in economics', 'in recent years many economic theorists have used a socalled newkeynesian frameworkin which optimizing agents are assumed to face constraints on price or wage setting in the form of adjustment costs or explicit nominal contractsto model inflation dynamics see woodford  chapter  for a textbook treatment', 'although these newkeynesian inflation models can differ importantly in their specifics they all tend to assign a central role to inflation expectations and resource utilization as drivers of inflation dynamics', 'in this exercise we ignore any inflation effects that might arise because of shifts in resource utilization induced by the change in import prices which are expressed relative to core prices', 'an expectationsaugmented phillips curve in which expectations of inflation are assumed to eventually respond oneforone to actual past inflation is typically referred to as an accelerationist phillips curve', 'qualitatively similar results obtain in fully specified structural models with rational expectationsincluding the frbus edo and sigma models maintained at the federal reserve boardin which the longterm behavior of inflation and inflation expectations is governed by the central banks fixed inflation objective', 'in evaluating the potential implications of this decline for expected pce inflation one also needs to keep in mind that tips are indexed to the cpi', 'cpi inflation generally runs a few tenths of a percentage point higher than pce inflation though that differential can vary materially over time', 'another complication is that we do not know whose expectations matter for determining inflation', 'inflation expectations of professional forecasters such as those collected in the blue chip economic indicators the survey of professional forecasters or the survey of primary dealers or inflation expectations derived from asset prices probably capture the views of participants in financial markets but need not reflect the views of households and firms more broadly', 'as an empirical matter the little information available on the longerterm inflation expectations of firms from the atlanta federal reserve business inflation expectations survey suggests that firms expectations more closely resemble expectations from the university of michigan surveys of consumers than the expectations of professional forecasters', 'similarly preliminary data from a new zealand study suggests that inflation forecasts of firms are much more similar to those of households than those of professional forecasters see coibion and gorodnichenko', 'damico kim and wei  examine a number of models that use tips yields to back out expected inflation estimates', 'the bestfitting models show only a small decline in longerterm inflation expectations since', 'my interpretation of the historical evidence is that longrun inflation expectations become anchored at a particular level only after a central bank succeeds in keeping actual inflation near some target level for many years', 'for that reason i am somewhat skeptical about the actual effectiveness of any monetary policy that relies primarily on the central banks theoretical ability to influence the publics inflation expectations directly by simply announcing that it will pursue a different inflation goal in the future', 'hence actual inflation would probably be affected only after the central bank has had sufficient time to concretely demonstrate its sustained commitment and ability to generate a new norm for the average level of inflation and the behavior of monetary policya process that might take years based on u.s. experience', 'consistent with my assessment that announcements alone are not enough bernanke and others  found no evidence across a number of countries that the initial disinflation which follows the adoption of inflation targeting is any less costly than disinflations carried out under alternative monetary regimes', 'some might be surprised that the preceding discussion of inflation determinants makes no mention of labor costs', 'in the past wages provided a good empirical indicator of the future direction of price inflation indeed the presence of a socalled wageprice spiral in which higher price inflation led workers to push for higher wage growth thereby in turn leading to even faster price increases as firms labor costs acceleratedwas often invoked to explain the inflationary dynamics of the s', 'the wageprice spiral no longer seems to provide a useful description of the u.s. inflation process', 'in fact some evidence suggests that like inflation the rate of growth of labor costs is now characterized by a stable longrun trend again a likely explanation for this empirical finding is the improved anchoring of longterm inflation expectations', 'more generally movements in labor costs no longer appear to be an especially good guide to future price movements', 'this development does not imply that wage developments carry no useful information because wage growth is influenced by labor market slack observed movements in compensation gains can provide an indication of how close the economy is to full employment', 'in the decomposition procedure movements in core inflation affect headline inflation oneforone as a result the contributions of food and energy price inflation are defined as each components price change relative to the core weighted by its share in total nominal consumer spending', 'note that the other category includes the effects of changes in food prices', 'the estimated contribution of movements in import prices is also computed relative to core inflation thus if import prices are rising at the same rate as core inflation they have no estimated effect on the shortfall of overall inflation from  percent', 'in addition the decomposition takes account of lags in the adjustment of core inflation to movements in resource utilization and other factors', 'as discussed later the current difference between the unemployment rate and its normal longerrun level likely understates the actual amount of slack that remains in the labor market', 'if so the estimates reported in figure  somewhat understate the contribution of slack to the current shortfall of inflation from  percent and correspondingly overstate the contribution from other factors', 'for example if the standard unemployment gap currently understates the true level of slack by  percentage point then the contribution of slack to this years inflation shortfall is roughly . percentage point larger than the estimate reported in figure', 'for a further discussion of the current level of resource utilization see the federal reserve boards most recent monetary policy report dated july', 'for a discussion of the supplyside damage that has occurred since  and the potential benefits of partially reversing it through more accommodative monetary policy see reifschneider wascher and wilcox  and van zandweghe forthcoming', 'in addition we cannot count on expectations remaining anchored if the federal reserve were to permit actual inflation to continue to run noticeably below its announced objective after the real economy has substantially recovered', 'this appendix was revised on december   to provide additional information on the definition of core import inflation and its implications for the longerrun rate of unemployment consistent with stable inflation', 'in addition the original version of the appendix incorrectly reported that the adjustment factor used to convert historical readings on expected longrun inflation from a cpi basis to a pce basis was  basis points', 'this measure of core import prices is constructed by board staff using published and unpublished data provided by the bureau of economic analysis and the bureau of labor statistics', 'the level of core import prices expressed relative to core consumer prices displayed a modest downward trend from  through  but since then has displayed little persistent trend particularly if one controls for shifts related to recent changes in the real exchange rate', 'if the post pattern persists in coming years then would be expected to converge to zero within a few quarters and core pce inflation to converge to  percent within two or three years assuming that the unemployment rate remains close to  percent the cbo estimate of the natural rate and there are no further shocks to the exchange rate and other factors', 'if however core import prices were expected to resume trending down relative to consumer prices then the model as specified would imply that the unemployment rate consistent with inflation stabilizing at  percent in the longer run would be somewhat lower than  percent']"

inflation to our  percent objective over the next two or three years consistent with data over recent months', 'in part the baseline outlook for real activity and inflation is little changed because

by slow global growth and the significant appreciation of the dollar since', 'these same global developments have also weighed on business investment by limiting firms expected sales thereby reducing their demand for capital goods partly as a result recent indicators of capital spending and business sentiment have been lackluster', 'in addition business investment has been held down by the collapse in oil prices since late  which is driving an ongoing steep decline in drilling activity', 'low oil prices have also resulted in largescale layoffs in the energy sector and adverse spillovers to output and employment in industries that support energy production', 'on balance overall employment has continued to grow at a solid pace so far this year in part because domestic household spending has been sufficiently strong to offset the drag coming from abroad', 'for a time equity prices were down sharply oil traded at less than  per barrel and many currencies were depreciating against the dollar', 'although prices in these markets have since largely returned to where they stood at the start of the year in other respects economic and financial conditions remain less favorable than they did back at the time of the december fomc meeting', 'in particular foreign economic growth now seems likely to be weaker this year than previously expected and earnings expectations have declined', 'by themselves these developments would tend to restrain u.s. economic activity', 'but those effects have been at least partially offset by downward revisions to market expectations for the federal funds rate that in turn have put downward pressure on longerterm interest rates including mortgage rates thereby helping to support spending', 'all told the committee continues to expect moderate economic growth over the medium term accompanied by further labor market improvement', 'consistent with this assessment the medians of the individual projections for economic growth unemployment and inflation made by all of the fomc participants for our march meeting are little changed from december', 'a key factor underlying such modest revisions is a judgment that monetary policy remains accommodative and will be adjusted at an appropriately gradual pace to achieve and maintain our dual objectives of maximum employment and  percent inflation', 'as has been widely discussed the level of inflationadjusted or real interest rates needed to keep the economy near full employment appears to have fallen to a low level in recent years', 'however the current real federal funds rate is even lower at roughly minus  percentage point when measured using the month change in the core price index for personal consumption expenditures pce which excludes food and energy', 'thus the current stance of monetary policy appears to be consistent with actual economic growth modestly outpacing potential growth and further improvements in the labor market', 'looking beyond the near term i anticipate that growth will also be supported by a lessening of some of the headwinds that continue to restrain the u.s. economy which include weak foreign activity dollar appreciation a pace of household formation that has not kept up with population and income growth and so has depressed homebuilding and productivity growth that has been running at a slow pace by historical standards since the end of the recession', 'otherwise monetary policy would eventually become overly accommodative as the economy strengthened', 'the future path of the federal funds rate is necessarily uncertain because economic activity and inflation will likely evolve in unexpected ways', 'turning to inflation here too the baseline outlook is little changed', 'in december the fomc anticipated that inflation would remain low in the near term due to the drag from lower prices for energy and imports', 'but as those transitory effects faded the committee expected inflation to move up to  percent over the medium term provided the labor market improves further and inflation expectations are stable', 'pce prices were up only  percent in february relative to a year earlier held down by earlier declines in the price of oil', 'in contrast core pce inflation which strips out volatile food and energy components was up . percent in february on a  month basis somewhat more than my expectation in december', 'even when measured on a month basis core inflation can vary substantially from quarter to quarter and earlier dollar appreciation is still expected to weigh on consumer prices in the coming months', 'for these reasons i continue to expect that overall pce inflation for  as a whole will come in well below  percent but will then move back to  percent over the course of  and  assuming no further swings in energy prices or the dollar', 'this projection however depends critically on expectations for future inflation remaining reasonably well anchored', 'it is still my judgment that inflation expectations are well anchored but as i will shortly discuss continued low readings for some indicators of expected inflation do concern me', 'risks to the outlook for real economic activity although the baseline outlook has changed little on balance since december global developments pose ongoing risks', 'one concern pertains to the pace of global growth which is importantly influenced by developments in china', 'there is a consensus that chinas economy will slow in the coming years as it transitions away from investment toward consumption and from exports toward domestic sources of growth', 'these uncertainties were heightened by market confusion earlier this year over chinas exchange rate policy', 'a second concern relates to the prospects for commodity prices particularly oil', 'for the united states low oil prices on net likely will boost spending and economic activity over the next few years because we are still a major oil importer', 'but the apparent negative reaction of financial markets to recent declines in oil prices may in part reflect market concern that the price of oil was nearing a financial tipping point for some countries and energy firms', 'in the event oil prices were to fall again either development could have adverse spillover effects to the rest of the global economy', 'if such downside risks to the outlook were to materialize they would likely slow u.s. economic activity at least to some extent both directly and through financial market channels as investors respond by demanding higher returns to hold risky assets causing financial conditions to tighten', 'risks to the inflation outlook the inflation outlook has also become somewhat more uncertain since the turn of the year in part for reasons related to risks to the outlook for economic growth', 'to the extent that recent financial market turbulence signals an increased chance of a further slowing of growth abroad oil prices could resume falling and the dollar could start rising again', 'and if foreign developments were to adversely affect the u.s. economy by more than i expect then the pace of labor market improvement would probably be slower which would also tend to restrain growth in both wages and prices', 'but even if such developments were to occur they would in my view only delay the return of inflation to  percent provided that inflation expectations remain anchored', 'unfortunately the stability of longerrun inflation expectations cannot be taken for granted', 'during the s inflation expectations rose markedly because the federal reserve allowed actual inflation to ratchet up persistently in response to economic disruptionsa development that made it more difficult to stabilize both inflation and employment', 'with considerable effort however the fomc gradually succeeded in bringing inflation back down to a low and stable level over the course of the s and early s', 'since this time measures of longerrun inflation expectations derived from both surveys and financial markets have been remarkably stable making it easier to keep actual inflation relatively close to  percent despite large movements in oil prices and pronounced swings in the unemployment rate', 'lately however there have been signs that inflation expectations may have drifted down', 'marketbased measures of longerrun inflation compensation have fallen markedly over the past year and half although they have recently moved up modestly from their alltime lows', 'similarly the measure of longerrun inflation expectations reported in the university of michigan survey of consumers has drifted down somewhat over the past few years and now stands at the lower end of the narrow range in which it has fluctuated since the late s', 'the shifts in these measures notwithstanding the argument that inflation expectations have actually fallen is far from conclusive', 'analysis carried out at the fed and elsewhere suggests that the decline in marketbased measures of inflation compensation has largely been driven by movements in inflation risk premiums and liquidity concerns rather than by shifts in inflation expectations', 'in addition the longerrun measure of inflation expectations from the michigan survey has historically exhibited some sensitivity to fluctuations in current gasoline prices which suggests that this measure may be an unreliable guide to movements in trend inflation under current circumstances', 'moreover measures of longerrun expected inflation gleaned from surveys of business and financial economists such as those reported in the survey of professional forecasters the blue chip survey and the survey of primary dealers have largely moved sideways in the past year or two', 'if so the return to  percent inflation could take longer than expected and might require a more accommodative stance of monetary policy than would otherwise be appropriate', 'despite the declines in some indicators of expected inflation we also need to consider the opposite risk that we are underestimating the speed at which inflation will return to our  percent objective', 'economic growth here and abroad could turn out to be stronger than expected and as the past few weeks have demonstrated oil prices can rise as well as fall', 'more generally economists understanding of inflation is far from perfect and it would not be all that surprising if inflation was to rise more quickly than expected over the next several years', 'for these reasons we must continue to monitor incoming wage and price data carefully', 'monetary policy implications let me now turn to the implications for monetary policy of this assessment of the baseline outlook and associated risks', 'in particular developments abroad imply that meeting our objectives for employment and inflation will likely require a somewhat lower path for the federal funds rate than was anticipated in december', 'this caution is especially warranted because with the federal funds rate so low the fomcs ability to use conventional monetary policy to respond to economic disturbances is asymmetric', 'by contrast if the expansion was to falter or if inflation was to remain stubbornly low the fomc would be able to provide only a modest degree of additional stimulus by cutting the federal funds rate back to near zero', 'one must be careful however not to overstate the asymmetries affecting monetary policy at the moment', 'in particular we could use the approaches that we and other central banks successfully employed in the wake of the financial crisis to put additional downward pressure on longterm interest rates and so support the economyspecifically forward guidance about the future path of the federal funds rate and increases in the size or duration of our holdings of longterm securities', 'if so as i emphasized earlier the fomc will adjust monetary policy as warranted', 'as i have already noted the decline in market expectations since december for the future path of the federal funds rate and accompanying downward pressure on longterm interest rates have helped to offset the contractionary effects of somewhat less favorable financial conditions and slower foreign growth', 'i continue to strongly believe that monetary policy is most effective when the fomc is forthcoming in addressing

eliminating the slack that has weighed on the labor market since the recession', 'the unemployment rate had fallen to  percent down from a peak of  percent in', 'the increase in the quits rate is a sign that workers are feeling more confident about the job market and are likely receiving more job offers', 'and while the unemployment rate was reported to have fallen further in may that decline occurred not because more people had jobs but because fewer people reported that they were actively seeking work', 'an encouraging aspect of the report however was that average hourly earnings for all employees in the nonfarm private sector increased  percent over the past  monthsa bit faster than in recent years and a welcome indication that wage growth may finally be picking up', 'for example the number of people filing new claims for unemployment insurancewhich can be a good early indicator of changes in labor market conditionsremains quite low and the publics perceptions of the health of the labor market as reported in various consumer surveys remain positive', 'during the downturn the philadelphia area and the city itself saw unemployment rise by less than it did for the nation as a whole but unemployment took longer to recover thereafter', 'in the city of philadelphia in particular unemployment was still running above  percent as recently as', 'but unemployment here has fallen appreciably since then helped by a revival in residential and commercial construction that is evident around the city', 'unemployment rates rose more during the recession for african americans and hispanics than for the nation overall and even though those rates have also come down by more during the economic expansion unemployment remains higher for these groups', 'unemployment rates for young

years even as the labor market strengthened significantly', 'over the  months through april the price index for personal consumption expenditures rose only about  percent', 'but i remain optimistic because two factors that have been holding down inflation will likely prove only temporary', 'first the sharp drop in crude oil prices since the middle of  has lowered prices of gasoline and other energy products significantly restraining overall inflation', 'at about the same time the foreign exchange value of the dollar strengthened holding down prices of imported goods', 'but oil prices have stopped declining and indeed have risen from their low point earlier this year', 'as the downward pressure on prices from these two forces dissipates and as the labor market strengthens further i expect inflation to move back to  percent', 'gdp growth was reported to have been relatively weak early this year but this measure of growth in economic activity can vary significantly from quarter to quarter', 'indeed while spending data for the second quarter are limited at present recent data on retail sales and motor vehicle sales point to a significant stepup in consumer spending and gdp growth this quarter', 'but speaking for myself although the economy recently has been affected by a mix of countervailing forces i see good reasons to expect that the positive forces supporting employment growth and higher inflation will continue to outweigh the negative ones', 'and as i just noted i expect to see inflation moving up to  percent over the next couple of years', 'the increase in employment over the past several years has contributed to higher household incomes and strengthening consumer confidence', 'if the may labor report was an aberration or reflects a temporary slowdown resulting from the weakness in economic activity at the start of the year then job growth should pick up and support further gains in income', 'in addition rising equity and house prices have helped restore households wealth', 'the fall in oil prices has supported household purchasing power as well', 'simple calculations suggest that the average household has gained some  in purchasing power since mid from the fall in gasoline prices', 'both home sales and construction have been gradually improving and residential investment made a noticeable contribution to gdp growth over the past year', 'and fiscal policy at the combined national state and local levels which subtracted from gdp growth for much of recovery is now a small positive', 'economic developments abroad have significantly restrained growth in the united states over the past year although i am cautiously optimistic that these headwinds are now fading', 'concerns about slowing growth in china and falling commodity prices which afflicted global financial markets early this year and thus likely weighed on demand appear to have eased somewhat', 'that said net exports have been a drag on u.s. gdp growth

economic forces have outweighed the negative and despite the challenges that the economy continues to face i continue to expect further progress toward our employment and inflation objectives', 'the first involves the thrust and resilience of domestic demand', 'the u.s. economy has performed better than many others around the globe and that performance has relied chiefly on the resilience of domestic sources of demand consumer spending in particular', 'i continue to think that the answer to that question is yes but the weak investment performance in recent months is concerning and fridays employment report provides another reminder that the question is still relevant', 'much of the turmoil early this year appeared to be associated with concern over the outlook for chinese growth which in turn has broad implications for commodity prices and global economic growth', 'however it is widely acknowledged that china faces considerable challenges as it continues to rebalance its economy toward domestic demand and consumption', 'more generally in the current environment of sluggish growth low inflation and already very accommodative monetary policy in many advanced economies investor perceptions of and appetite for risk can change abruptly', 'a third key uncertainty for the u.s. economy is the outlook for productivity growththat is increases in the amount of output produced per hour worked', 'while the job market has strengthened significantly gdp increases have been less impressive', 'that combination of solid labor market gains and moderate gdp growth reflects the fact that labor productivity growth has been unusually weak in recent years averaging less than  percent per year since', 'over time productivity growth is the key determinant of improvements in living standards supporting higher pay for workers without increased costs for employers', 'recent weak productivity growth likely helps account for the disappointing pace of wage gains during this economic expansion', 'therefore understanding whether and by how much productivity growth will pick up is a crucial part of the economic outlook', 'there is some evidence that the deep recession had a longlasting effect in depressing investment research and development spending and the startup of new firms and that these factors have in turn lowered productivity growth', 'in the meantime it would be helpful to adopt public policies designed to boost productivity', 'strengthening education and promoting innovation and investment public and private will support longerterm growth in productivity and greater gains in living standards', 'a fourth important uncertainty for the economic outlook involves how quickly inflation will move back to  percent', 'as long as oil prices do not resume their earlier declines and the dollar does not rise substantially further my expectation is that inflation will move up to  percent over the next one to two years', 'but oil prices and the dollar can move unpredictably', 'in addition a further strengthening of labor market conditions would typically be estimated to exert modest upward pressure on inflation over the next couple of years but such estimates are inherently imprecise and the effect on inflation could turn out to be significantly different either upward or downward than i expect', 'uncertainty concerning the outlook for inflation also reflects in part uncertainty about the behavior of those inflation expectations that are relevant to price setting', 'for two decades inflation has been relatively stable reacting less persistently than before to temporary factors like a recession or a swing in oil prices', 'the most convincing explanation for this stability in my view is that longerterm inflation expectations have remained quite stable', 'so it bears noting that some survey measures of longerterm inflation expectations have moved a little lower over the past couple of years while proxies for these expectations inferred from financial market instruments like inflationprotected securities have moved down more noticeably', 'it is unclear whether these indicators point to a true decline in those inflation expectations that are relevant for price setting for example the financial market measures may reflect changing attitudes toward inflation risk more than actual inflation expectations', 'if inflation expectations really are moving lower that could call into question whether inflation will move back to  percent as quickly as i expect', 'policy implications let me now turn to the implications of the economic outlook as well as the uncertainties associated with that outlook for monetary policy', 'my overall assessment is that the current stance of monetary policy is generally appropriate in that it is providing support to the economy by encouraging further labor market improvement that will help return inflation to  percent', 'at the same time i continue to think that the federal funds rate will probably need to rise gradually over time to ensure price stability and maximum sustainable employment in the longer run', 'first the current stance of monetary policy is stimulative although perhaps not as stimulative as might appear at first glance', 'at present many estimates show the neutral rate to be quite low by historical standardsindeed close to zero when measured in real or inflationadjusted terms', 'with the actual real federal funds rate modestly below the relatively low neutral real rate the stance of monetary policy at present should be viewed as modestly accommodative', 'although the economy is now fairly close to the fomcs goal of maximum employment i view our modestly accommodative stance of policy as appropriate for several reasons', 'first with inflation continuing to run below our objective a mild undershooting of the unemployment rate considered to be normal in the longer run could help move inflation back up to  percent more quickly', 'second a stronger job market could also support labor market improvement along other dimensions including greater labor force participation', 'a third reason relates to the risks associated with the constraint on conventional monetary policy when the federal funds rate is near zero', 'if inflation were to move persistently above  percent or the economy were to become notably overheated the committee could readily increase the target range for the federal funds rate', 'however if inflation were to remain persistently low or the expansion were to falter the fomc would be able to provide only a limited amount of additional stimulus through conventional means', 'these motivations notwithstanding i continue to believe that it will be appropriate to gradually reduce the degree of monetary policy accommodation provided that labor market conditions strengthen further and inflation continues to make progress toward our  percent objective', 'because monetary policy affects the economy with a lag steps to withdraw this monetary accommodation ought to be initiated before the fomcs goals are fully reached', 'but i stress that the economic outlook including the pace at which the neutral rate may shift over time is uncertain so monetary policy cannot proceed on any preset path', 'in addition data received during the winter suggested that u.s. growth had weakened even as progress in the labor market remained solid', 'in addition consumer spending appears to have rebounded providing some reassurance that overall growth has indeed picked up as expected', 'does the latest reading on the unemployment rate indicate that we are essentially back to full employment or does relatively subdued wage growth signal that more slack remains', 'conclusion to summarize i have explained why i expect the u.s. economy will continue to improve and why i expect that further gradual increases in the federal funds rate will probably be appropriate to best promote the fomcs goals

has generally run about  percentage points higher than for the broader metropolitan area', 'the notion that inflation can be too low sounds strange to many people but very low inflation typically means very low nominal interest rates leaving little room for monetary policy to push rates down to offset adverse shocks to the economy thereby increasing the chances that recessions and the associated job losses would be more severe and persistent', 'in addition persistent and unexpectedly low inflation may significantly raise the real cost of making mortgage and other loan payments if

down below normal levels because of the factors i discussed earlier including persistently weak growth abroad the high exchange value of the dollar low rates of household formation and weak productivity growth', 'the targeted federal funds rate currently . percent less the month core inflation rate for personal consumption expenditures through april equals about negative . percent', 'there are unconventional policy tools that could be employed to provide further support to aggregate demand if necessary and the efficacy and costs of using those tools would be weighed by the fomc

shortterm interest rates rather than by actively managing its asset holdings', 'that strategyraising shortterm interest rates once the recovery was sufficiently advanced while maintaining a relatively large balance sheet and plentiful bank reservesdepended on our ability to pay interest on excess reserves', 'but even after the volume of reserves falls substantially ioer will still be important as a contingency tool because we may need to purchase assets during future recessions to supplement conventional interest rate reductions', 'thus we expect to have less scope for interest rate cuts than we have had historically', 'in part current expectations for a low future federal funds rate reflect the fomcs success in stabilizing inflation at around  percenta rate much lower than rates that prevailed during the s and s', 'another key factor is the marked decline over the past decade both here and abroad in the longrun neutral real rate of interestthat is the inflationadjusted shortterm interest rate consistent with keeping output at its potential on average over time', 'several developments could have contributed to this apparent decline including slower growth in the workingage populations of many countries smaller productivity gains in the advanced economies a decreased propensity to spend in the wake of the financial crises around the world since the late s and perhaps a paucity of attractive capital projects worldwide', 'although these factors may help explain why bond yields have fallen to such low levels here and abroad our understanding of the forces driving longrun trends in interest rates is nevertheless limited and thus all predictions in this area are highly uncertain', 'based on the fomcs behavior in past recessions one might think that such a low interest rate could substantially impair policy effectiveness', 'in most cases this tighterthannormal stance of policy before the recession appears to have reflected some combination of initially higherthannormal labor utilization and elevated inflation pressures', 'as a result a large portion of the rate cuts that subsequently occurred during these recessions represented the undoing of the earlier tight stance of monetary policy', 'but if it did the federal funds rate at the onset of the recession would be well above its normal level and the fomc would be able to cut shortterm interest rates by substantially more than  percentage points', 'it shows simulated paths for interest rates the unemployment rate and inflation under three different monetary policy responsesthe aggressive rule in the absence of the zero lower bound constraint the constrained aggressive rule and the constrained aggressive rule combined with  trillion in asset purchases and guidance that the federal funds rate will depart from the rule by staying lower for longer', 'as the red dashed line shows the federal funds rate would fall far below zero if policy were unconstrained thereby causing longterm interest rates to fall sharply', 'i but despite the lower bound asset purchases and forward guidance can push longterm interest rates even lower on average than in the unconstrained case especially when adjusted for inflation by reducing term premiums and increasing the downward pressure on the expected average value of future shortterm interest rates', 'thus the use of such tools could result in even better outcomes for unemployment and inflation on average', 'for one the frbus simulations may overstate the effectiveness of forward guidance and asset purchases particularly in an environment where longterm interest rates are also likely to be unusually low', 'in addition policymakers could have less ability to cut shortterm interest rates in the future than the simulations assume', 'by some calculations the real neutral rate is currently close to zero and it could remain at this low level if we were to continue to see slow productivity growth and high global saving', 'in addition to taking the federal funds rate back down to nearly zero the fomc could resume asset purchases and announce its intention to keep the federal funds rate at this level until conditions had improved markedlyalthough with longterm interest rates already quite low the net stimulus that would result might be somewhat reduced', 'on the monetary policy side future policymakers might choose to consider some additional tools that have been employed by other central banks though adding them to our toolkit would require a very careful weighing of costs and benefits and in some cases could require legislation', 'beyond that some observers have suggested raising the fomcs  percent inflation objective or implementing policy through alternative monetary policy frameworks such as pricelevel or nominal gdp targeting', 'beyond monetary policy fiscal policy has traditionally played an important role in dealing with severe economic downturns', 'finally and most ambitiously as a society we should explore ways to raise productivity growth', 'stronger productivity growth would tend to raise the average level of interest rates and therefore would provide the federal reserve with greater scope to ease monetary policy in the event of a recession', 'but more importantly stronger productivity growth would enhance americans living standards', 'though outside the narrow field of monetary policy many possibilities in this arena are worth considering including improving our educational system and investing more in worker training promoting capital investment and research spending both private and public and looking for ways to reduce regulatory burdens while protecting important economic financial and social goals', 'conclusion although fiscal policies and structural reforms can play an important role in strengthening the u.s. economy my primary message today is that i expect monetary policy will continue to play a vital part in promoting a stable and healthy

downturns that appear to have resulted largely or entirely from a shock to aggregate demand', 'in particular the study finds that in the wake of the crisis the united states experienced a modest reduction in labor supply as a result of reduced immigration and a fall in labor force participation beyond what can be explained by cyclical conditions and demographic factors as well as a marked slowdown in the estimated trend growth rate of labor productivity', 'if we assume that hysteresis is in fact present to some degree after deep recessions the natural next question is to ask whether it might be possible to reverse these adverse supplyside effects by temporarily running a highpressure economy with robust aggregate demand and a tight labor market', 'finally albeit more speculatively

innovative businesses', 'in addition if strong economic conditions can partially reverse supplyside damage after it has occurred then policymakers may want to aim at being more accommodative during recoveries than would be called for under the traditional view that supply is largely independent of demand', 'more research is needed however to better understand the influence of movements in aggregate demand on aggregate supply', 'from a policy perspective we of course need to bear in mind that an accommodative monetary stance if maintained too long could have costs that exceed the benefits by increasing the risk of financial instability or undermining price stability', 'heterogeneity my second question asks whether individual differences within broad groups of actors in the economy can influence aggregate economic outcomesin particular what effect does such heterogeneity have on aggregate demand', 'although households typically reduce their spending in response to wealth declines the many households whose equity positions in their homes were actually driven negative by the reduction in house prices may have curtailed their spending even more sharply because of a

factors that may be part of the explanation for the great recessions long duration and the subsequent slow recovery', 'more generally if larger firms seeking to expand have better access to credit than smaller ones overall growth in investment and employment could depend in part on the distribution of sales across different types of businesses', 'economists understanding of how changes in fiscal and monetary policy affect the economy might also benefit from the recognition that households and firms are heterogeneous', 'for example in simple textbook models of the monetary transmission mechanism central banks operate largely through the effect of real interest rates on consumption and investment', 'for example spending by many households and firms appears to be quite sensitive to changes in labor income business sales or the value of collateral that in turn affects their access to creditconditions that monetary policy affects only indirectly', 'nevertheless the various linkages between heterogeneity and aggregate demand are not yet well understood either empirically or theoretically', 'more broadly even though the tools of monetary policy are generally not well

might go something like this  inflation is characterized by an underlying trend that has been essentially constant since the mids previously this trend seemed to drift over time influenced by actual past inflation or other economic conditions', 'theory and evidence suggest that this trend is strongly influenced by inflation expectations that in turn depend on monetary policy', 'in particular the remarkable stability of various measures of expected inflation in recent years presumably represents the fruits of the federal reserves sustained efforts since the early s to bring down and then stabilize inflation at a low level', 'the anchoring of inflation expectations that has resulted from this policy does not however prevent actual inflation from fluctuating from year to year in response to the temporary influence of movements in energy prices and other disturbances', 'in addition inflation will tend to run above or below its underlying trend to the extent that resource utilizationwhich may serve as an indicator of firms marginal costsis persistently high or low', 'while this general framework for thinking about the inflation process remains useful questions about some of its quantitative features have arisen in the wake of the great recession and the subsequent slow recovery', 'for example the influence of labor market conditions on inflation in recent years seems to be weaker than had been commonly thought prior to the financial crisis', 'although inflation fell during the recession the decline was quite modest given how high unemployment rose likewise wages and prices rose comparatively little as the labor market gradually recovered', 'or does it perhaps reflect the welldocumented reluctanceor alternatively limited abilityof firms to cut the nominal wages of their employees which could help to explain the relatively moderate movements in inflation we saw during and after the recession', 'another gap in our knowledge about the nature of the inflation process concerns expectations', 'although many theoretical models suggest that actual inflation should be most closely related to shortrun inflation expectations as an empirical matter

to know more about the manner in which inflation expectations are formed and how monetary policy influences them', 'ultimately both actual and expected inflation are tied to the central banks inflation target whether that target is explicit or implicit', 'does a central bank have to keep actual inflation near the target rate for many years before inflation expectations completely conform', 'can policymakers instead materially influence inflation expectations directly and quickly by simply announcing their intention to pursue a particular inflation goal in the future', 'or does the truth lie somewhere in between with a change in expectations requiring some combination of clear communications about policymakers inflation goal concrete policy actions to demonstrate their commitment to that goal and at least some success in moving actual inflation toward its desired level in order to demonstrate the feasibility of the strategy', 'although historical experience suggests that changing the publics inflation expectations would be neither quick nor easy it is not clear which of these possibilities is correct', 'with nominal shortterm interest rates at or close to their effective lower bound in many countries the broader question of how expectations are formed has taken on heightened importance', 'under such circumstances many central banks have sought additional ways to stimulate their economies including adopting policies that are directly aimed at influencing expectations of future interest rates and inflation', 'the unusually explicit and extended guidance about the likely future path of the federal funds rate that was provided by the fomc from  through  is an example of such a policy as is the bank of japans upward revision to its official inflation objective in', 'moreover these and other expectational strategies may be needed again in the future given the likelihood that the global economy may continue to experience historically low interest rates thereby

been driven by consumer spending which has been bolstered by substantial gains in household income and wealth', 'but recent readings on business sentiment and new orders for equipment are consistent with the view that capital spending will likely strengthen modestly this year another positive factor is that oil drilling which plummeted after oil prices fell sharply back in late  has recently begun to pick up', 'as we look to broader trends gross domestic product gdp growth has been restrained in recent years by a variety of forces depressing both supply and demand including slow labor force and productivity growth weak growth abroad and lingering headwinds from the financial crisis', 'although i am cautiously optimistic that some of these forces will abate over time i anticipate that they will continue to restrain overall growth over the medium term likely holding down the level of interest rates consistent with stable labor market conditions', 'turning to inflation we are now much closer to the fomcs  percent objective than we were just a year ago', 'prices as measured by the index for personal consumption expenditures pce rose nearly  percent in the  months ending in november as compared with only  percent during', 'moreover core pce inflationa better indicator of the underlying inflation trendpicked up  percentage point to a little over  percent', 'this rise in inflation was anticipated and largely represents a fading of the effects of earlier declines in energy prices and the prices of nonenergy imports', 'in addition slack in labor and product markets is no longer placing downward pressure on inflation in contrast to the situation only a few years ago when the unemployment rate was still quite elevated', 'barring future major swings in oil prices and the foreign exchange value of the dollar inflation is likely to move up to  percent over the next couple of years aided by a strong labor market', 'in light of the progress that has been achieved toward our employment and inflation objectives and the committees assessment of the outlook the fomc raised the target range for the federal funds rate at its december meeting by  basis points to between  and  basis points', 'the committee judges however that the stance of monetary policy remains modestly accommodative and so policy should support some further strengthening in labor market conditions and thus the return of inflation to our  percent goal', 'maintaining sustainable growth in a context of price stability with the unemployment rate near its longerrun normal level and likely to move a bit lower this year a natural question is whether monetary policy has fallen behind the curve', 'as shown in figure  increases in average hourly earnings the employment cost index and compensation per hour remain subdued picking up only modestly of late', 'most importantly although core inflation is rising gradually from a low level this increase mainly reflects the waning of the effects of earlier movements in the dollar not upward pressure from resource utilization', 'of course even if the labor market is not overheated currently one might worry that overheating could rapidly emerge as labor market conditions strengthen further causing inflation to surge', 'first the pace of labor market improvement has slowed appreciably in the past couple of years for example average payroll gains moderated from  per month in  to  last year and the unemployment rate declined  percentage points cumulatively over  and  compared with only  percentage point last year', 'second economic growth more broadly seems unlikely to pick up markedly in the near term given the ongoing restraint from weak foreign demand and other factors that i mentioned particularly in an environment in which monetary policy is likely to become gradually less accommodative', 'finally figure  illustrates the relationship over the past several decades between labor market pressures and core inflation', 'note that during periods when the unemployment rate fell below the congressional budget offices estimate of its normal longrun level shown by the yellow shaded regions core inflation the solid red line rose little if at all', 'this stability is especially marked since inflation expectations became anchored during the midtolate s', 'waiting too long to remove accommodation could cause inflation expectations to begin ratcheting up driving actual inflation higher and making it harder to control', 'the combination of persistently low interest rates and strong labor market conditions could lead to undesirable increases in leverage and other financial imbalances although such risks would likely take time to emerge', 'finally waiting too long to tighten policy could require the fomc to eventually raise interest rates rapidly which could risk disrupting financial markets and pushing the economy into recession', 'for these reasons i consider it prudent to adjust the stance of monetary policy gradually over timea strategy that should improve the prospects that the economy will achieve sustainable growth with the labor market operating at full employment and inflation running at about  percent', 'evaluating the appropriate stance of monetary policy achieving these goals could prove challenging however even if the economy manages to avoid being hit with adverse shocks over the next few years', 'to sustain a strong job market with inflation at our  percent objective policy must gradually shift toward a neutral stance where neutral is defined as a level of the federal funds rate that is neither expansionary nor contractionary when the economy is operating near its potential', 'to help answer such questions the fomc considers a voluminous amount of information concerning many factors including financial markets and credit availability labor market conditions and overall economic activity wages and prices and foreign economic developments', 'the fomc also evaluates forecasts from a range of economic models assessments of key risks to the outlook and detailed analyses of how different monetary policy strategies would affect projected outcomes and risks', 'among the strategies routinely considered by the committee are the recommendations of a variety of simple monetary policy rules', 'in addition fomc participants prepare individual projections on a quarterly basis of the most likely paths of key macroeconomic variables under their own assessments of appropriate monetary policy together with their estimates of the normal longerrun values of the federal funds rate the unemployment rate and gdp growth', 'as i noted the committee routinely reviews policy recommendations from a variety of benchmark rules and i believe that their prescriptions can be helpful in providing broad guidance about how the federal funds rate should be adjusted over time in response to movements in real activity and inflation', 'consider first the wellknown taylor rule which embodies key principles of good monetary policy', 'the rule calls for systematic adjustments in the federal funds rate relative to its expected longerrun neutral level in response to movements in inflation and the output gap defined as the percentage difference between actual output and the economys productive potential', 'should inflation be defined using the latest noisy quarterly reading on headline pce inflation or a measure intended to smooth through transitory price movements', 'the taylor rule is often implemented by assuming that the real or inflationadjusted value of the longerrun neutral interest ratewhich i will call r for convenienceis equal to  percent roughly the average historical value of the real federal funds rate prior to the financial crisis', 'for inflation we can use the month change in core pce prices a measure of the current underlying rate of inflation', 'and the output gap can be reasonably approximated as twice the difference between the estimated longerrun normal rate of unemployment and the actual unemployment rate', 'the dashed red line in figure  shows the resulting recommendations for policy over the medium term based on the medians of the unemployment and inflation projections submitted by fomc participants in december but assumingin contrast to the median of participants december assessmentsthat r equals  percent', 'as illustrated by the lefthand panel of figure  since  both fomc participants and respondents to the blue chip survey have markedly reduced their projections of the level of real shortterm interest rates expected to prevail in the longer run', 'presumably these revisions were made in response to accumulating evidence that lower real interest rates than those seen on average in the past would be needed permanently to keep the economy operating on an even keel', 'in addition the righthand panel shows considerable changes over time in estimates of the normal longerrun rate of unemployment with corresponding implications for estimates of the economys productive potential and the output gap', 'clearly sensible implementation of policy rules requires adjustments to take such changes into account as a failure to do so would result in poor monetary policy decisions and poor economic outcomes', 'because overall growth has been quite moderate over the past few years despite an accommodative stance of monetary policy some recent estimates of the current value of the neutral real federal funds rate stand close to zero', 'if the neutral rate were to remain quite low over the medium term as would be expected if the global economy does not materially strengthen and productivity growth remains anemic then the appropriate setting for r in the taylor rule would arguably be zero yielding a yet lower path for the federal funds rate as shown by the longdashed red line', 'for example simple rules ignore such important factors as fiscal policy trends affecting global growth structural developments influencing the supply of credit and overall financial conditions', 'the downward pressure on longerterm interest rates that the feds asset holdings exert is expected to diminish over timea development that amounts to a passive removal of monetary policy accommodation', 'but if the economy instead began to overheat threatening to push inflation to an undesirably high level the fomc would have ample scope to respond through tighter monetary policy', 'because participants on average anticipate a modest undershooting of the unemployment rate below its estimated longerrun level the balancedapproach rule calls for a slightly faster pace of tightening over the next several years than the taylor rule', 'as its name implies this rule does not prescribe a particular level of the federal funds rate at a given time but rather how the existing rate should change from quarter to quarter based on two gapsthe difference between inflation and its desired level as well as the difference between the unemployment rate and its longerrun normal level', 'instead it moves interest rates up and down until both gaps close an approach that in theory enables it to perform well when the true value of r is unknown', 'because both gaps are relatively modest at the moment and are projected to remain so the change rule calls for fairly gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy over the next few years given the current outlook', 'nevertheless the three benchmarks i have describedthe taylor rule the balancedapproach rule and the change rule appropriately calibratedhave historically provided useful guidance about appropriate adjustments in the general direction of monetary policy over time', 'this guidance is illustrated by figure  which compares the path of the federal funds rate since  with the prescriptions of the three rules based on the actual rates of inflation and unemployment observed at each point in time along with contemporaneous blue chip projections of the longerrun unemployment rate and r', 'in addition all three rules signaled that monetary policy needed to provide more stimulus during the recession and the subsequent recovery than could be provided by keeping shortterm interest rates near zero', 'for this reason the committee turned to asset purchases to help make up for the shortfall by putting additional downward pressure on longerterm interest rates', 'to sum up simple policy rules can serve as useful benchmarks to help assess how monetary policy should be adjusted over time', 'conclusion my remarks have focused on the policy trajectory that the committee now considers likely to be appropriate to sustain the economic expansion while keeping inflation close to our  percent goal', 'for example productivity growth is a key determinant of the neutral rate and while most forecasters expect productivity growth to pick up from its recent unusually slow pace the timing of such a pickup is highly uncertain', 'indeed there is little consensus among researchers about the causes of the recent slowdown in productivity growth that has occurred both at home and abroad', 'the strength of global growth will also have an important bearing on the neutral rate through both trade and financial channels and here too the scope for surprises is considerable', 'however as this discussion

job openings hiring and quits survey readings on net hiring plans and the difficulty of filling vacancies and the average duration of unemployment', 'however improvements in labor market conditions along this dimension arguably reflect an increase in potential output and so they are probably not a source of inflationary pressures', 'during the late s through the s however inflation did rise noticeably whenever the unemployment rate moved below its longerrun normal level primarily because the federal reserve did not adequately check persistent movements in inflation by tightening monetary policy thereby allowing inflation expectations to drift', 'this experience illustrates the importance of keeping inflation expectations anchored through systematic policy actions', 'the federal

when the opposite holds', 'historically percent deviations of real gdp from statistical estimates of its longrun trend are roughly twice as large on average as deviations of the unemployment rate from its estimated longrun valuea relationship known as okuns law', 'additional complications arise in the measurement of economic slack because the difference between the unemployment rate and its estimated normal level is not always a complete gauge of overall labor utilization', 'such was the case in the current expansion until recently because the labor force participation rate was unusually low and involuntary parttime employment unusually high given the level of the unemployment rate', 'if monetary policy persistently followed the prescriptions of a taylor rule that assumed that r was  percent when it was in fact  percent then employment would run persistently below its maximum sustainable level and inflation would run persistently below  percent', 'under such circumstances

economy is operating near its potential', 'in effect a neutral policy stance is one where monetary policy neither has its foot on the brake nor is pressing down on the accelerator', 'this level is quite low by historical standards reflecting in part slow productivity growth and an aging population not only in the united states but also in many advanced economies', 'moreover the current value of the neutral real federal funds rate appears to be even lower than this longerrun value because of several additional headwinds to the u.s. economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis such as subdued economic growth abroad and perhaps a lingering sense of caution on the part of households and businesses in the wake of the trauma of the great recession', 'with the actual value of the real

necessary to deploy new tools to supply the considerable monetary accommodation required by the extremely weak state of the job market and persistently low inflation', 'those toolsespecially our

stability because it is low enough that it does not need to figure prominently into peoples and businesses economic decisions but high enough to serve as a buffer against deflation and provide greater scope for monetary policy to address economic weakness', 'that step however did not mark an immediate shift toward tighter monetary policy because we also indicated then that we did not expect to raise interest rates for a considerable time after the end of our securities purchases', 'we decided that maintaining a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy remained appropriate because while the u.s. economy was stronger and closer to meeting our statutory goals we saw significant room for improvement', 'in particular the unemployment rate still stood above our assessment of its

more likely to continue to come in on the low side in coming years', 'some of the recent decline in inflation although not all reflects idiosyncratic shifts in the prices of some items such as the large decline in telecommunication service prices seen earlier in the year that are unlikely to be repeated', 'as the green dashed line in figure  illustrates if the average change in consumer prices each month is calculated excluding items whose price changes are outliers on both the high and low side the resulting trimmed mean measure of inflation shows less of a slowdown this year', 'based on analyses of this sort my colleagues and i currently think that this years low inflation is probably temporary so we continue to anticipate that inflation is likely to stabilize around  percent over the next few years', 'but our understanding of the forces driving inflation is imperfect and we recognize that something more persistent may be responsible for the current undershooting of our

noticeably different are considerable', 'here the red line indicates the median of the latest inflation projections submitted by fomc participants that i showed previously', 'the width of this region reflects the average accuracy of inflation projections made by private and government forecasters over the past  years', 'as the figure shows based on that history there is a  percent probability that inflation could be greater than  percent or less than  percent next year', 'most of this uncertainty reflects the influence of unexpected movements in oil prices and the foreign exchange value of the dollar as well as that of idiosyncratic developments unrelated to broader economic conditions', 'these factors could easily push overall inflation noticeably above or below  percent for a time', 'but such disturbances are not a great concern from a policy perspective because their effects fade away as long as inflation expectations remain anchored', 'for this reason the fomc strives to look through these transitory inflation effects when setting monetary policy', 'such was the case when rising oil prices pushed headline inflation noticeably above  percent for several years prior to the financial crisis', 'similarly the committee substantially discounted the reductions in inflation that occurred from  through  as a result of the decline in oil prices and the effects of the dollars

remain low for longer than currently projected', 'for example labor market conditions may not be as tight as they appear to be and thus they may exert less upward pressure on inflation than anticipated', 'alternatively longrun inflation expectations which have an important influence on actual inflation may not be consistent with the fomcs  percent goal', 'more broadly the conventional

benefits and compensate for the accompanying reduction in inflationary pressures', 'a related question is whether the unemployment rate alone is an adequate gauge of economic slack for the purposes of explaining inflation', 'although the unemployment rate is probably the best single summary measure of labor utilization some indicators have shown less improvement since the financial crisis', 'but employment rates for this group may now be permanently lower than in the past as a result of declining employment opportunities for lessskilled workers a rising number of people receiving disability insurance and other worrisome trends', 'on balance the unemployment rate probably is correct in signaling that overall labor market conditions have returned to precrisis levels', 'but that return does not necessarily demonstrate that the economy is now at maximum employment because due to demographic and other structural changes the unemployment rate that is sustainable today may be lower than the rate that was sustainable in the past', 'in that regard some observers have pointed to the continued subdued pace of wage growth as evidence that the economy is not yet back to full employment', 'as shown in figure  labor compensation as measured by the employment cost index the shortdashed red line has been growing at more or less the same rate since  and hourly compensation in the nonfarm business sector the shortandlongdashed green linea quite noisy measure even after smoothingis actually growing more slowly', 'but growth in average hourly earnings the solid blue line and the atlanta feds wage growth tracker the longdashed black line have clearly picked up', 'in addition productivity growth has been quite weak in recent years and empirical analysis suggests that it is has been holding down aggregate growth in labor compensation independent of labor utilization in recent years', 'an analysis of the pattern of wage growth at the u.s. state level also suggests that subdued growth for the country as a whole probably reflects sluggish productivity or some other factor common to all states because crossstate differences in wage growth are about what one would expect given crossstate differences in unemployment rates', 'that said the evidence does not allow for any definitive assessment so policymakers must remain open minded on this question and its implications for reaching our inflation goal', 'inflation expectations another source of uncertainty concerns inflation expectations', 'in standard economic models inflation expectations are an important determinant of actual inflation because in deciding how much to adjust wages for individual jobs and prices of goods and services at a particular time firms take into account the rate of overall inflation they expect to prevail in the future', 'monetary policy presumably plays a key role in shaping these expectations by influencing the average rate of inflation experienced in the past over long periods of time as well as by providing guidance about the fomcs objectives for inflation in the future', 'even so economists understanding of exactly how and why inflation expectations change over time is limited', 'moreover we have to contend with the fact that we do not directly observe the inflation expectations relevant to wage and price setting', 'the fomcs outlook depends importantly on the view that longerrun inflation expectations have been stable for many years at a level consistent with pce price inflation that will average around  percent in the longer run', 'provided this stability continues standard models suggest that actual inflation should stabilize at about  percent over the next two or three years in an environment of roughly full employment absent any future shocks', 'however there is a risk that inflation expectations may not be as well anchored as they appear and perhaps are not consistent with our  percent goal', 'to assess this risk the fomc considers a variety of survey measures of expected longerrun inflation some of which are shown in figure', 'longrange projections of pce price inflation made by private forecasters the solid red line have been remarkably stable for many years as have been the longerrun inflation expectations reported in surveys of financial market participants not shown', 'if so stabilizing inflation at around  percent could prove to be more difficult than expected', 'in theory differences between yields on conventional treasury securities and those on treasury inflationprotected securities tips are also informative about inflation expectations in that they measure the compensation received by investors for exposing themselves to future changes in consumer prices', 'as indicated by the longdashed green line tips inflation compensation for the fiveyear period starting five years from now has fallen roughly  percentage point over the past three years', 'this decline could be interpreted as a significant drop in market participants expectations for the most likely outcome for inflation in the longer run', 'however research suggests that the fall in tips inflation compensation instead primarily reflects a decline in inflation risk premiums and differences in the liquidity of nominal and indexed treasury securities', 'this research notwithstanding the notable decline in inflation compensation may be a sign that longerterm inflation expectations have slipped recently', 'misspecified inflation dynamics another risk is that our framework for understanding inflation dynamics could be misspecified in some fundamental way perhaps because our econometric models overlook some factor that will restrain inflation in coming years despite solid labor market conditions', 'one possibility in this vein is a continuation of the subdued growth in healthcare prices that we have seen in recent yearsa sectorspecific factor not controlled for in standard models', 'because health care accounts for a large share of total consumer spending this slow growth has restrained overall inflation materially and may continue to do so for some time', 'a similar situation occurred during the s when a significant shift in health insurance enrollment away from feeforservice and toward hmo that is health maintenance organization plans reduced cost pressures and held down overall inflation for several years', 'if these sorts of favorable supplytype shocks continue achieving our  percent inflation goal over the medium term may require a more accommodative stance of monetary policy than might otherwise be appropriate', 'some commentators have conjectured that because of rising trade volumes and the integration of production chains across countries u.s. inflation now depends on global resource utilization not just on conditions here at home and those effects arising through movements in energy and import prices', 'moreover foreign economic growth has firmed this year and the global economy appears to have largely recovered so any influence that global resource utilization might have on u.s. inflation would presumably be small', 'nevertheless increased competition from the integration of china and other emerging market countries into the world economy may have materially restrained price margins and labor compensation in the united states and other advanced economies', 'if this restraint on the labor share continues to build over the next few years and not merely holds steady then it could indirectly hold down the growth of domestic wages and prices in ways not captured by conventional models', 'more speculatively changes in the structure of the domestic economy may also be altering inflation dynamics in ways not captured by conventional models', 'the growing importance of online shopping by increasing the competitiveness of the u.s. retail sector may have reduced price margins and restrained the ability of firms to raise prices in response to rising demand', 'finally i would note the possibility that inflation may rise more sharply in response to robust labor market conditions than anticipated', 'the influence of labor utilization on inflation has become quite modest over the past  years implying that the inflationary consequences of misjudging the sustainable rate of unemployment are low', 'although the evidence is weak that inflation responds in a nonlinear manner to resource utilization this risk is one that we cannot entirely dismiss', 'in this spirit fomc participantslike private forecastershave reduced their estimates of the sustainable unemployment rate appreciably over the past few years in response to the continual flow of information about the always changing economy', 'to the extent these assessments change over time so too will the outlook and judgments about the appropriate stance of monetary policy', 'importantly even if resource utilization is currently lower than we estimate or if longerrun inflation expectations are running at levels consistent with longerrun pce price inflation somewhat below  percent the fomc can still achieve its inflation goal', 'under those conditions continuing to revise our assessments in response to incoming data would naturally result in a policy path that is somewhat easier than that now anticipatedan appropriate course correction that would reflect our commitment to maximum employment and price stability', 'similar considerations apply to other important sources of uncertainty such as the value of the neutral real interest ratethat is the inflationadjusted level of the federal funds rate consistent with keeping the economy operating on an even keel', 'but the neutral rate changes over time as a result of the interaction of many forces including demographics productivity growth fiscal policy and the strength of global demand so its value at any point in time cannot be estimated or projected with much precision', 'my fomc colleagues and i will therefore need to continue to reassess and revise our assessments of the neutral rate in response to incoming data and adjust monetary policy accordingly', 'a gradual approach is particularly appropriate in light of subdued inflation and a low neutral real interest rate which imply that the fomc will have only limited scope to cut the federal funds rate should the economy be hit with an adverse shock', 'thus without further modest increases in the federal funds rate over time there is a risk that the labor market could eventually become overheated potentially creating an inflationary problem down the road that might be difficult to overcome without triggering a recession', 'persistently easy monetary policy might also eventually lead to increased leverage and other developments with adverse implications for financial stability', 'for these reasons and given that monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation with a substantial lag it would be imprudent to keep monetary policy on hold until inflation is back to  percent', 'conclusion to conclude standard empirical analyses support the fomcs outlook that with gradual adjustments in monetary policy inflation will stabilize at around the fomcs  percent objective over the next few years accompanied by some further strengthening in labor market conditions', 'but the outlook is uncertain reflecting among other things the inherent imprecision in our estimates of labor utilization inflation expectations and other factors', 'as a result we will need to carefully monitor the incoming data and as warranted adjust our assessments of the outlook and the appropriate stance of monetary policy', 'but in making these adjustments our longerrun objectives will remain unchangedto promote maximum employment and  percent

many analysts that something more structural may be going on', 'first given that estimates of the natural rate of unemployment are so uncertain it is possible that there is more slack in u.s. labor markets than is commonly recognized which may be true for some other advanced economies as well', 'if so some further tightening in the labor market might be needed to lift inflation back to  percent', 'second some measures of longerterm inflation expectations have edged lower over the past few years in several major economies and it remains an open question whether these measures might be reflecting a true decline in expectations that is broad enough to be affecting actual inflation outcomes', 'third our framework for understanding inflation dynamics could be misspecified in some way', 'for example global developmentsperhaps technological in nature such as the tremendous growth of online shoppingcould be helping to hold down inflation in a persistent way in many countries', 'or there could be sectorspecific developmentssuch as the subdued rise in medical prices in the united states in recent yearsthat are not typically included in aggregate inflation equations but which have contributed to lower inflation', 'such global and sectoral developments could continue to be important restraining influences on inflation', 'of course there are also risks that could unexpectedly boost inflation more rapidly than expected such as resource utilization having a stronger influence when the economy is running closer to full capacity', 'in this economic environment with ongoing improvements in labor market conditions and softness in inflation that is expected to be temporary the fomc has continued its policy of gradual policy normalization', 'by limiting the volume of securities that private investors will have to absorb as we reduce our holdings the caps should guard against outsized moves in interest rates and other potential market strains', 'changing the target range for the federal funds rate is our primary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy', 'our balance sheet is not intended to be an active tool for monetary policy in normal times', 'we continue to expect that the ongoing strength of the economy will warrant gradual increases in that rate to sustain a healthy labor market and stabilize inflation around our  percent longerrun objective', 'i have spoken about some of the uncertainties associated with the inflation outlook in particular and we will be paying close attention to the inflation data in the months ahead', 'but uncertainty about the outlook is by no means limited to inflation', 'as always the committee will adjust the stance of monetary policy in response to incoming economic information and the evolution of the economic outlook to achieve its objectives of maximum employment and stable prices']"
yellen20171020a.txt,"['namely i will discuss the unconventional monetary policy tools used by the federal reserve since the start of the financial crisis and great recession and the role that those tools may play in addressing future economic challenges', 'nearly  years ago with our nation mired in its worst economic and financial crisis since the great depression the federal open market committee fomc confronted a key challenge to the pursuit of its congressionally mandated goals of maximum employment and price stability how to support a weakening u.s. economy once our main conventional policy tool the federal funds rate had been lowered to essentially zero', 'addressing that problem eventually led to a second challenge how to ensure that we could scale back monetary policy accommodation in an orderly fashion once it was no longer needed', 'failure to meet either challenge would have significantly compromised our ability to foster maximum employment and price stability leading to serious consequences for the livelihoods of millions of americans', 'thanks in part to the monetary policy accommodation provided in the aftermath of the crisisespecially through enhanced forward rate guidance and largescale asset purchasesthe u.s. economy has made great strides', 'indeed with the economy now operating near maximum employment and inflation expected to rise to the fomcs  percent objective over the next couple of years the fomc has been scaling back the accommodation provided in response to the great recession', 'while i believe that influencing shortterm interest rates should continue to be our primary monetary policy lever in normal times our unconventional policy tools will likely be needed again should some future economic downturn drive shortterm interest rates back to their effective lower bound', 'consequently the probability that shortterm interest rates may need to be reduced to their effective lower bound at some point is uncomfortably high even in the absence of a major financial and economic crisis', 'meeting the challenge of providing additional accommodation a substantial body of evidence suggests that the u.s. economy is much stronger today than it would have been without the unconventional monetary policy tools deployed by the federal reserve in response to the great recession', 'two key tools were largescale asset purchases and forward guidance about our intentions for the future path of shortterm interest rates', 'the rationale for those tools was straightforward given our inability to meaningfully lower shortterm interest rates after they reached nearzero in late  the fomc used increasingly explicit forward rate guidance and asset purchases to apply downward pressure on longerterm interest rates which were still well above zero', 'longerterm interest rates reflect in part financial market participants expectations of the future path of shortterm interest rates', 'as a result fomc communications that affect those expectationssuch as the enhanced forward rate guidance provided in our postmeeting statements in the aftermath of the great recessioncan affect longerterm interest rates', 'in addition longerterm interest rates include a term premium which is the compensation demanded by investors for bearing the interest rate risk associated with longerterm securities', 'when the federal reserve buys longerterm securities in the open market the remaining stock of securities available for purchase by the public declines which pushes the prices of those securities up and thus depresses their yields by lowering the term premiums embedded in those yields', 'several studies have found that our forward rate guidance and asset purchases did appreciably reduce longerterm interest rates', 'the fomcs goal in lowering longerterm interest rates was to help the u.s. economy recover from the recession and stem the disinflationary forces that emerged from it', 'indeed the evidence strongly suggests that forward rate guidance and securities purchasesby substantially lowering borrowing costs for millions of american families and businesses and making overall financial conditions more accommodativedid help spur consumption and business spending lower the unemployment rate and stave off disinflationary pressures', 'evidence accumulated from their experience also supports the notion that these tools have helped stimulate economic activity in their countries after their shortterm interest rates were lowered to nearzeroand in some cases even below zero', 'meeting the challenge of scaling back accommodation by  the u.s. economy was making notable progress toward the fomcs goals of maximum employment and price stability', 'the unemployment rate had dropped to  percent by midyearwell below its great recession peak of  percentand other measures of labor market conditions were also showing significant improvement', 'in addition inflation as measured by the change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures had reached about  percent by mid after hovering around  percent in the fall of', 'reflecting that progress the federal reserves focus was shifting from providing additional monetary policy accommodation to scaling it back', 'one possible approach was to start by reducing the federal reserves securities holdings while shortterm interest rates remained at the lower bound', 'we could allow securities to roll off the federal reserves balance sheet and even sell securities thereby putting upward pressure on longterm rates while calibrating the pace and configuration of the reduction in our holdings as warranted by our maximum employment and price stability objectives', 'eventually once our securities holdings had shrunk sufficiently the fomc could start nudging up its shortterm interest rate target', 'given the lack of experience with reducing our asset holdings to scale back monetary policy accommodation and the need to carefully calibrate the removal of accommodation the fomc opted to allow changes in the federal reserves securities holdings to play a secondary role in the committees normalization strategy', 'rather than balance sheet shrinkage the fomc decided that its primary tool for scaling back monetary policy accommodation would be influencing shortterm interest rates', 'as we explained in our normalization principles issued in september  the fomc decided to maintain the overall size of the federal reserves securities holdings at an elevated level until sometime after the fomc had begun to raise shortterm interest rates', 'once normalization of the level of the federal funds rate was well under way and the committee judged that the economic expansion was strong enough that further increases in shortterm interest rates were likely to be warranted the fomc would gradually and predictably reduce the size of the balance sheet by allowing the federal reserves securities holdings to run offthat is we would allow our balance sheet to shrink passively by not reinvesting all of the principal payments from our securities', 'one advantage of the fomcs chosen approach to scaling back accommodation is that both the fomc and the public have decades of experience with adjustments in shortterm interest rates in response to changes in economic conditions', 'nonetheless the postcrisis environment presented a new test to the fomcs ability to influence shortterm interest rates', 'other market interest rates would then increase accordingly', 'having authority to pay interest on excess reserves means that the federal reserve can influence the federal funds rate and other shortterm interest rates regardless of the amount of excess reserves in the banking system', 'the mechanics of the new framework are straightforward banks will generally only provide shortterm funding at an interest rate around or above what they could earn at the fed', 'this new approach for raising shortterm interest rates is working well since december  we have raised the interest paid on excess reserves and the target range for the federal funds rate by  basis points and the effective federal funds rate has risen accordingly', 'the fomc anticipated that its decision to maintain the size of the federal reserves securities holdings at an elevated level until sometime after the beginning of rate hikes would keep some downward pressure on longerterm interest rates well after the end of its asset purchase programs', 'although estimates of the effect of our securities holdings on longerterm interest rates are subject to uncertainty a recent study reported that the federal reserves securities holdings were reducing the term premium on the year treasury yield by roughly  percentage point at the end of', 'let me turn my attention briefly to the likely response of longerterm yields which as i have noted reflect both a term premium component and expectations of the future path of shortterm interest rates', 'if financial market participants perceived no change in the economic outlook and no intention on the part of the fomc to alter the overall stance of monetary policy the fomcs inclination to leave the size of the balance sheet unchanged would be taken as an indication that the fomc would instead rely more on increases in shortterm interest rates to scale back accommodation resulting in a faster pace of shortterm interest hikes', 'on net longerterm yields may be little affected by this hypothetical scenario while the decreased emphasis on balance sheet reduction would depress term premiums and hold longerterm yields lower the expected faster pace of shortterm interest rate increases would push longerterm yields higher', 'a key question for the future as the financial crisis and great recession fade into the past and the stance of monetary policy gradually returns to normal a natural question concerns the possible future role of the unconventional policy tools we deployed after the onset of the crisis', 'my colleagues on the fomc and i believe that whenever possible influencing shortterm interest rates by targeting the federal funds rate should be our primary tool', 'i believe their deployment should be considered again if our conventional tool reaches its limitthat is when the federal funds rate has reached its effective lower bound and the u.s. economy still needs further monetary policy accommodation', 'with a low neutral federal funds rate there will typically be less scope for the fomc to reduce shortterm interest rates in response to an economic downturn raising the possibility that we may need to resort again to enhanced forward rate guidance and asset purchases to provide needed accommodation', 'of course substantial uncertainty surrounds any estimates of the neutral level of shortterm interest rates', 'if we are indeed living in a lowneutralrate world a significantly less severe economic downturn than the great recession might be sufficient to drive shortterm interest rates back to their effective lower bound', 'as a result of the great recession the federal reserve has confronted two key challenges over the past several years one the fomc had to provide additional policy accommodation after shortterm interest rates reached their effective lower bound and two subsequently as we made progress toward the achievement of our mandate we had to start scaling back that accommodation in the presence of a vastly expanded federal reserve balance sheet', 'first the monetary policy tools that the federal reserve deployed in the immediate aftermath of the crisisexplicit forward rate guidance largescale asset purchases and the payment of interest on excess reserveshave helped us overcome these challenges', 'second in light of evidence suggesting that the neutral level of shortterm interest rates is significantly lower than it was in previous decades the likelihood that future monetary policymakers will have to confront those two challenges again is uncomfortably high', 'for this reason we must keep our unconventional policy tools ready to be deployed again should shortterm interest rates return to their effective lower bound']"
