"Rudd, Senior Adviser, Division of Research and Statistics, Board of Governors  Mark Carey,2 Associate Director, Division of International Finance, Board of Governors; Joshua Gallin, Associate Director, Division of Research and Statistics, Board of Governors  2 Attended the discussion of the relationship between monetary policy and financial stability."
"Crump2 and Marco Del Negro, Assistant Vice Presidents, Federal Reserve Bank of New York  Jim Dolmas, Senior Research Economist, Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas  Nina Boyarchenko,2 Financial Economist, Federal Reserve Bank of New York  The Relationship between Monetary Policy and Financial Stability The staff presented several briefings on a special topic, the relationship between monetary policy and financial stability."
" The presentations began with an overview of the possible linkages among monetary policy, macroprudential tools, and financial s tability, drawing on both academic research and experience with such tools in various countries."
 The staff then reviewed empirical literature on the linkages between the stance of monetary policy and financial stability.
" Lastly, the staff presented illustrative simulation results from a specific macroeconomic model to explore whether and how monetary policy should react to financial imbalances as well as the extent to which monetary and macroprudential policies should be coordinated to best achieve macroeconomic goals and financial stability goals."
"In their comments on the briefings and in their discussion of the relationship between monetary policy and financial stability, FOMC participants noted that more stringent regulatory and supervisory policies implemented since the financial crisis, including enhanced capital and liquidity requirements for some types of financial institutions, had sign ificantly increased the resilience of the financial system to shocks."
 Most participants judged that the benefits of using monetary policy to address threats to financial stability would typically be outweighed by the costs associated with deviations from the Committee’s employment and pricestability objectives induced by such actions; some also noted that the benefits are highly uncertain.
" Nonetheless, participants generally agreed that the Committee should no t completely rule out the possibility of using monetary policy to address financial stability risks, particularly in circumstances in which such risks significantly threatened the achievement of its dual mandate and when macroprudential tools had been or were likely to be ineffective at mitigating those risks."
" Finally, participants stressed th e need for further research and analysis to advance understanding of the relationship between monetary poli cy and financial stability and to help identify situations in which it might be desirable to incorporate financial stabi lity considerations in the design of monetary policy."
"Developments in Financial Markets and Open Market Operations The manager of the System Open Market Account (SOMA) reported on developments in domestic and foreign financial markets, including changes in market participants’ expectations for the course of U.S. monetary policy."
Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information reviewed for the April 26–27 FOMC meeting indicated that labor market conditions improved further in the first quarter even though growth in real gross domestic product (GDP) appeared to have slowed.
" Consumer price inflation continued to run below the Committee’s longerrun objective of 2 percent, restrained in part by earlier decreases in energy prices and declining prices of nonenergy imports."
" Surveybased measures of longerrun inflation expectations were little changed, on balance, in recent months, while marketbased measures of inflation compensation were still low."
"Total nonfarm payroll employment expanded at a solid pace in March, and labor market conditions generally continued to strengthen."
" Although the unemployment rate edged up to 5.0 percent, both the labor force participation rate and the employmentto-population ratio continued to increase."
" In late March and early April, the fourweek moving average of initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits was essentially unchanged, on net, at a low level."
 Labor productivity growth appeared to have remained slow over the four quarters ending in the first quarter of this year.
" Manufacturing output decreased, partly reflecting the effects on export demand of earlier appreciation of the foreign exchange value of the dollar."
Growth in real personal consumption expenditures (PCE) appeared to have slowed in the first quarter.
" Nevertheless, recent readings on key factors that influence consumer spending were consistent with a pickup in real PCE growth in the coming months."
"The U.S. international trade deficit widened in February, as imports rose more than exports; however, preliminary data on trade in goods suggested that the deficit narrowed substantially in March, with imports falling back sharply even as exports declined."
" In all, the recent data indicated that net exports probably continued to be a moderate drag on real GDP growth in the first quarter."
" Core PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in food and energy prices, was 1¾ percent over the same 12month period, held down in part by falling prices of nonenergy imports and the passthrough of declines in energy prices to prices of other goods and services."
" Over the 12 months ending in March, total consumer prices as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) rose 1 percent, while core CPI inflation was 2¼ percent."
" In light of the CPI data, both total and core PCE price inflation on a 12month basis appeared to slow a bit in March."
" Survey measures of longerrun inflation expectations—including those from the Michigan survey along with the Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants—were generally little changed, on balance, in recent months, although the reading from the Michigan survey in early April was at the low end of  its historical range."
Recent indicators suggested that foreign real GDP growth had picked up in the first quarter after a lackluster performance last year.
 Economic growth in Canada appeared to have rebounded from a very weak fourth quarter.
 Recent data on industrial production and retail sales pointed to a pickup in economic growth in the euro area.
" In contrast, economic growth in China moderated in the first quarter, although economic indicators in March were more upbeat than in the earlier months of the year."
" In the advanced foreign economies (AFEs), headline inflation remained low, Page 4Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ held down by earlier declines in energy prices."
" With inflation generally running below the target rates in these economies, monetary policies remained very accommodative."
" By contrast, overall inflation in emerging market economies (EMEs) rose in the first quarter, largely reflecting increases in inflation in much of Latin America along with an increase in inflation in China that was driven by higher food prices."
"Staff Review of the Financial Situation Financial market conditions improved further, on balance, over the intermeeting period, with investors appearing to respond to Federal Reserve communications that were viewed as more accommodative than anticipated and to somewhat bett erthan-expected incoming data on foreign economic activity."
 Measures of inflation compensation based on Treasury InflationProtected Securities increased somewhat but remained at low levels.
"Over the intermeeting period, broad U.S. equity price indexes moved up, on net, likely because of investors’ views that monetary policy would be more accommodative than previously expected along with an improvement in risk sentiment."
 Growth of commercial and industrial (C&I) loans on banks’ books remained strong and continued to be driven by lending to investmentgrade borrowers by large banks.
" Nonetheless, according to the most recent Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS), on balance, banks further tightened their lending standards on C&I loans to large and middlemarket firms in the first quarter, while demand for such loans weakened."
" However, demand for CRE loans reportedly strengthened, and CRE loans on banks’ books continued to grow at a robust pace over the first quarter."
"Growth of residential real estate (RRE) loans on banks’ books continued to be low th rough the first quarter, and credit conditions stayed ti ght for mortgage borrowers with low credit scores, hardto-document income, or relatively high debtto-income ratios."
" A significant number of SLOOS respondents reportedly eased lending standards on residential mortgages eligible for purchase by the governmentsponsored enterprises, and a significant number also experienced stronger demand overall for RRE loans in the first quarter."
" Over the same period, demand for auto loans reportedly strengthened further at many banks."
" Consumer loan balances continued to  increase at a robust pace through February, and data on bank lending activities suggested further growth through March."
" A number of factors likely contributed to the improvem ent, including expectations of more accommodative monetary policy in the United States."
" In particular, leverage and maturity transformation in the financial sector were subdued relative to historical levels, and growth of aggregate private nonfinancialsector credit was modest."
"Staff Economic Outlook In the U.S. economic forecast prepared by the staff for the April FOMC meeting, real GDP growth in the first quarter of this year was estimated to have been much slower than in the forecast prepared for the March meeting, although projected real GDP growth in the second quarter was revised up a little."
" Beyond the near term, real GDP was expected to increase slightly faster than in the previous forecast, largely reflecting a somewhat higher projected trajectory for equity prices and lower assumed paths for both long erterm interest rates and the foreign exchange value of the dollar."
 The unemployment rate was expected to gradually decline further and to run somewhat below the staff’s estimate of its longerrun natural rate over this period.
The staff’s forecast for inflation was little changed from the previous projection.
" The staff continued to project that inflation would increase over the next several years, as energy prices and the pr ices of nonenergy imports were expected to begin steadily rising this year, but inflation was still projected to be  slightly below the Committee’s longerrun objective of 2 percent in 2018."
"The staff viewed the uncertainty around its April projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as similar to the average of the past 20 years."
" Consistent with the downside risk to aggregate demand, the staff viewed the risks to its outlook for the unemployment rate as skewed to the upside."
" The risks to the projection for inflation were still judged as weighted to the downside, reflecting the possibility that longerterm inflation ex pectations may have edged down."
"Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants agreed that the information received over the intermeeting period indicated that labor market conditions improved further even as growth in economic activity appeared to have slowed."
" Growth in household spen ding had moderated, although households’ real income had risen at a solid rate and consumer sentiment rema ined high."
" Inflation had continued to run below the Committee’s 2 percent longerrun objective, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and falling prices of nonenergy imports."
" Marketbased measures of inflation compensation remained low; surveybased measures of longerrun inflation expectations were little changed, on balance, in recent months."
"Although the incoming data suggested that aggregate spending in the first quarter had been weaker than expected, participants continued to anticipate that economic activity would expand at a moderate pace over the medium term and that labo r market indicators would continue to strengthen."
" Inflation was expected to remain low in the near term, in  part because of earlier declines in energy prices, but to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of the declines in energy and import prices dissipated and the labor market strengthened further."
 Most pointed to the steady improvement in the labor market as an indicator that the underlying pace of economic activity had likely not deteriorated as much as was suggested by the recent data on spending and production.
" Notably, solid job gains and real income growth, along with a high level of household wealth and relatively upbeat consumer sentiment, were expected to support a pickup in consumer spending after its slowdown in the first quarter."
" Many also thought that, as had apparently been the case in recent years, a low reading on seasonally adjusted firstquarter GDP growth could partly reflect measurement problems and, if so, would likely be followed by stronger GDP growth in subsequent quarters."
" They saw a risk that a more persistent slowdown in economic growth might be under way, which could hinder further improvement in labor market conditions."
" The shift in policy expectations, along with incoming data showing that economic growth abroad picked up during the first quarter of the year, seemed to contribute to the improved tone in global financial markets."
 Some participants noted that global financial markets could be sensitive to the upcoming British referendum on membership in the European Union or to unanticipated developments associated with China’s management of its exchange rate.
"Minutes of the Meeting of April 26–27, 2016Page 7_____________________________________________________________________________________________ While the recent data suggested markedly slower growth in consumer spending in the first quarter than seen in 2015, most participants expected to see a pickup in the growth rate of consumer spending in coming months in light of the stillsolid fund amental determinants of household spending."
" Ongoing strong gains in employment and low energy prices were boosting aggregate household real income, and the level of household wealth was relatively high."
" Nonetheless, manufacturing industries dependent on exports or the energy sector were still experiencing weak demand."
" The low level of oil prices continued to depress activity in the domestic energy sector, and a couple of participants suggested that, even with the ongoing cutbacks in production and potential increases in global demand, the imbalance of supply of crude oil relative to demand could last into 2017 and lead to further reductions in capital investment by energy firms."
" As noted by a number of participants, the weakness in capital spending in recent quarters was in part due to the ongoing contraction in drilling activity and weak demand from abroad for goods manufactured in the United States."
" Increases in nonfarm payroll employment averaged almost 210,000 per month over the first three months of 2016."
" Although  the unemployment rate changed little over that period, the labor force participation rate moved up and the pool of potential workers, which includes the unemployed as well as those who would like a job but are not actively looking, continued to shrink."
 Many participants judged that labor market conditions had reached or were quite close to those consistent with their interpretation of the Committee’s objective of maximum employment.
 Many other part icipants continued to see scope for reducing labor market slack as labor demand continued to expand.
" In that regard, a number of participants indicated that the recent rise in the participation rate was a positive development, suggesting that a tighter labor market could potentia lly draw more individuals back into the workforce on a sustained basis without adding to inflationary pressures and thus increase the productive capacity of the economy."
 It was also noted that businesses might satisfy increases in labor demand in part by converting involuntary parttime jobs to fulltime positions.
"Over the past five years, employment and hours worked rose relatively strongly while the pace of the expansion in output was moderate, resulting in measured productivity growth of slightly less than ½ percent per year on average."
" It was noted that participants’ projections of the longerrun growth rate of real GDP, shown in the Summary of Economic Projections, appeared to assume Page 8Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ that productivity growth would strengthen."
" While acknowledging uncertainty about the reasons for the slowdown in productivity growth in recent years and whether it would persist, many participants commented on a range of possible outcomes that could result from slowerthan-expected productivity growth."
" Some saw the possibility that, even with real GDP growth remaining relatively slow, the unemployment rate might decline more quickly and inflation might rise a bit more rapidly than expected if productivity growth continued to disappoint in coming quarters while hiring remained strong."
" In that case, monetary policy accommodation might need to be removed more quickly than currently anticipated."
" Alternatively, continued low productivity growth for a time might instead lead to slowerthan-anticipated growth in household income and business sales, thereby resulting in paths for the unemployment rate and the federal funds rate little different than currently expected."
" Moreover, several participants noted that if trend productivity growth remained permanently lower—a development that could be quite difficult to identify in only a few quarters—the likely implication for monetary policy would be a reduction in the longerrun equilibrium federal funds rate."
The incoming information on inflation over the intermeeting period showed that the earlier declines in energy prices and falling prices of nonenergy imports were still contributing importantly to low headline inflation.
" Despite the recent rise in core inflation, some participants continued to see progress toward the Committee’s 2 percent inflation objective as likely to be gradual."
 Several commented that the stronger labor market still appeared to be exerting little upward pressure on wage or price inflation.
" Moreover, several continued to see important do wnside risks to inflation in light of the stilllow readings on marketbased measures of inflation compensation and the slippage in the past couple of years in some survey measures of expected longerrun inflation."
"  However, for many other participants, the recent deve lopments provided greater confidence that inflation would rise to 2 percent over the medium term."
" Some viewed the recent firming in core inflation as broadly based and unlikely to unwind, with several noting recent increases in alternative measures of the trend in inflation, such as the trimmed mean PCE and the median CPI, or citing evidence that wage growth was picking up."
" In addition to the ongoing tightening of resource utilization, the recen t depreciation of the dollar and the firming in oil prices suggested that the downward pressures on both core and headline inflation from declining prices of nonoil imports and energy should begin to subside."
" In addition, the recent depreciation of the dollar and indications of a rebound of economic growth in China appeared to reduce pressures on the renminbi."
" More broadly, signs of a pickup in growth in economic activity in some AFEs and emerging Asian economies other than China also appeared to contribute to the improvement in sentiment in financial markets."
" They generally concurred that data releases during the intermeeting period on components of private domestic demand had been disappointing, but most participants judged that the slowdown in growth of domestic  spending would be temporary, citing possible measurement problems and other transitory factors."
" Financial market conditions continued to improve, providing support to aggregate demand and suggesting that market participants saw some reduction in downside risks to the outlook:  Equity prices rose further, credit spreads declin ed somewhat, and the dollar depreciated over the intermeeting period."
" Taking these developments into account, participants generally judged that the mediumter m outlook for economic activity and the labor market had not changed appreciably since the previous meeting."
" Furthermore, most participants continued to expect that, with labor markets continuing to strengthen, the do llar no longer appreciating, and energy prices apparently having bottomed out, inflation would move up to the Committee’s 2 percent objective in the medium run."
"Still, with 12month PCE inflation continuing to run below the Committee’s 2 percent objective, a number of participants judged that it would be appropriate to proceed cautiously in removing policy accommodation."
 Some participants pointed to the risk that the recent weak data on domestic spending could reflect a loss of momentum in the economy that might hinder further gains in the labor market and raise the likelihood that inflation could fail to increase as expected.
" Accordingly, these participants believed that it would be important to evaluate whether incoming information was consistent with their expectation that economic growth would pick up and thus support continued improvement in the labor market."
" In addition, a number of participants judged that the risks to the outlook for inflation remained tilted to the downside in light of low readings on measures of inflation compensation and the fall over the past year in some survey measures of longerterm inflation expectations."
"Some participants saw limited costs to maintaining a patient posture at this meeting but noted the risks—including potential risks to financ ial stability—of waiting too long to resume the process of removing policy accommodation, especially given the lags with which monetary policy affects the economy."
"  A few participants judged it appropriate to increase the target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting, citing their assessments that  downside risks associated with global economic and financial developments had diminished substantially since early this year, that labor market conditions were consistent with the Committee’s maximumemployment objective, and that inflation was likely to rise this year toward the Committee’s 2 percent objective."
" Two participants noted that several standard policy benchmarks, such as a number of interest rate rules and some measures of th e equilibrium real interest rate, continued to imply values  for the federal funds rate well above the current target range."
" Such large and persistent deviations of the federal funds rate from these benchmarks, in their view, posed a risk that the removal of policy accommodation was proceeding too slowly and that the Committee might, in the future, find it necessary to raise the federal funds rate  quickly to combat inflation pressures, potentially unduly disrupting economic or financial activity."
" Participants agreed that their ongoing assessments of the data and other incoming information, as well as the implications for the outlook, would determine the timing and pace of future adjustments to the stance of monetary policy."
" Most participants judged that if incoming data were consistent with economic growth picking up in the second quarter, labor market conditions continuing to strengthen, and inflation making progress toward the Committee’s 2 percent objective, then it likely would be appropriate for the Committee to increase the target range for the federal funds rate in June."
"Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that information received since the FOMC met in March indicated that labor market conditions had improved furt her even as growth in economic activity had appeared to slow."
" They noted that growth in household spending had moderated, although households’ real income had risen at a solid rate and consumer sentiment had remained high."
" Members noted that inflation had continued to run below the Committee’s 2 percent longerrun objective, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and falling prices of nonenergy imports."
 Marketbased measures of inflation compensation remained low.
" Surveybased measures of longerterm inflation expectations were little changed, on balance, in recent months."
"With respect to the economic outlook and its implications for monetary policy, members continued to expect that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity would expand at a moderate pace and labor market indi cators would continue to strengthen."
" Members also continued to expect inflation to remain low in the near term, in part because of earlier declines in energy prices, but to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of declines in energy and import prices dissipa ted and the labor market strengthened further."
" In its postmeeting statement, rather than stating that global economic and financial developments continued to pose risks, the Committee decided to indicate that it wo uld continue to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments."
" Members generally agreed that, in light of th e recent weak readings on spending and production, and with inflation below the Committee’s objective, it would be prudent to wait for additional information bearing on the mediumterm outlook before deciding whether to raise the target range for the federal funds rate."
" Members again agreed that, in determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Comm ittee would assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation."
" This assessment would take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
" In light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, the Committee agreed that it would carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal."
" Regarding the possibility of adjustments in the stance of policy at the next meeting, members generally judged it appropriate to leave their policy options open and maintain the flexibility to make this decision based on how the incoming data and developments shaped their outlook for the labor market and inflation as well as their evolving assessments of the balance of risks around that outlook."
 The Committee also directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve’s agency mortgagebacked securities transactions.” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p.m.: “Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in March indicates that labor market conditions have improved further even as growth in economic activity appears to have slowed.
" Growth in household spending has moderated, although households’ real income has risen at a solid rate and consumer sentiment remains high."
" Inflation has continued to run below the Committee’s 2 percent longerrun objective, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and falling prices of nonenergy imports."
" Marketbased measures of inflation compensation remain low; surveybased measures of longerterm inflation expectations are little changed, on balance, in recent months."
"Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
" The Co mmittee currently expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market indicators will continue to strengthen."
" Inflation is expected to remain low in the near term, in part because of earlier declines in energy prices, but to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further."
 The Committee continues to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments.
" The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting further improvement in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation."
"In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target ra nge for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation."
" This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
" In light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, the Committ ee will carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation Page 12Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ goal."
" Potential downside risks to the econom ic outlook had diminished since the March FOMC meeting, and the modal outlook was for economic growth, employment, and inflation outcomes consistent with the Committee’s statutory objectives."
" She believed that monetary policy should respond to these developmen ts by gradually removing accommodation and noted that several frameworks for assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, such as prescriptions from various policy rules and some estimates of equilibrium inte rest rates, also suggested that a reduction in monetary policy accommodation would be appropriate."
"Consistent with the Committee’s decision to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the Board of Governors took no action to change the interest rates on reserves  or discount rates."
