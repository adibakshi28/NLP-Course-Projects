"In support of the Committee’s longerrun planning for improvements in the implementation of monetary policy, the staff presented an update on the potential for establishing a fixedrate, fullallotment overnight reverse repurchase agreement (RRP) facility."
" The presentation summarized initial discussions with financial market firms about how such a facility might affect money market interest rates and intermediation flows, what the relationship might be between the facility rate and other money market rates, and how the different types of firms might view the facility."
" Overall, the inquiries suggested that the fa cility could be an effective additional tool for managing money market interest rates and helping to support a floor on those rates."
"  These operations may be announced when authorized by the Chairman, may begin when authorized by the Chairman on or after September 23, 2013, and shall be authorized through the FOMC meeting that ends on January 29, 2014.” Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information reviewed for the September 17–18 meeting suggested that economic activity continued to increase at a moderate rate."
" Privatesector employment rose further in July and Au gust, but the unemployment rate was still elevated."
" Total consumer price inflation picked up in recent months but continued to be modest, and measures of longerrun inflation expectations remained stable."
"Private nonfarm employment continued to expand in July and August, but at a somewhat slower pace than in the first half of the year, while total government employment edged down on balance."
 The unemployment rate declined further to 7.3 percent in August.
" The labor force participation rate also decreased, leaving the employmentto-population ratio essentially unchanged in recent months."
" Measures of firms’ hiring plans moved up, initial clai ms for unemployment insurPage 2Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ance declined, and the share of workers employed part time for economic reasons decreased a little."
" However, household expectations of the labor market situation deteriorated somewhat, rates of job openings and gross privatesector hiring were little changed, on net, and the rate of longduration unemployment rose slightly."
Growth in real private expenditures for business equipment and intellectual property products appeared to be subdued going into the third quarter.
"Reductions in real federal government purchases appeared to persist:  Defense spending continued to decrease in July and August , while federal employment edged down further."
The U.S. international trade deficit narrowed substantially in June before widening  in July to a level near its secondquarter average.
"Total U.S. inflation, as measured by the PCE price index through July and by the consumer price index through August, was about 1½ percent over the preceding 12month period for each series."
" Core consumer price inflation, which excludes food and energy, was modest in July and August."
 Both nearterm and longerterm inflation expectations from the Michigan survey were little changed in August and early September.
" Both compensation per hour and unit labor costs in the nonfarm business sector rose modestly  over the year ending in the second quarter, as there were only slight gains in productivity."
"Average foreign economic growth remained muted in the first half of the year, although there were some notable divergences across countries."
" Growth in real gross domestic product (GDP) picked up in the second quarter in the United Kingdom and remained strong in Japan, recent data suggested that the euroarea economy was coming out of recession, and economic indicators were positive for Chin a and several other emerging market economies (EMEs) in Asia."
 Foreign inflation was generally subdued.
" Monetary policy remained highly accommodative in the advanced economies, but some EME central banks moved toward tighter monetary policy in the face of capital outflows and depreciation pressures."
"Staff Review of the Financial Situation Longerterm interest rates rose over the intermeeting period, while equity prices were fairly volatile but ended the period modestly higher."
 The move in interest rates appeared to be importantly influenced by shifting expectations about monetary policy.
"The path of the federal funds rate implied by financial market quotes steepened notably during the period, in part reflecting some increase in uncertainty about the outlook for monetary policy as indicated by optionimplied measures of uncertainty about the future path of the policy rate."
" Yields on corporate bonds, agency MBS,  and Treasury inflationprotected securities rose about in line with those on nominal Treasury securities."
Credit flows to nonfinancial  businesses remained solid in the face of higher longerterm interest rates.
" Nonetheless, applications for new mortgages declined only modestly, apparently supported by improvements in labor market conditions and some pentup demand."
Bank credit declined in Ju ly and August amid the general rise in longerterm interest rates.
" While banks’ holdings of assets with longer duration, such as residential mortgages, decreased,  growth in C&I, CRE, and automobile loans—which are more likely to have floating interest rates or relatively short maturities, and therefore less duration risk —tended to hold up in recent months."
"Against a backdrop of higher interest rates in the advanced economies and slowing economic growth in the EMEs, several EME currencies came under downward pressure in August; yields and CDS premiums on EME sovereign debt increased, pa rticularly for those economies experiencing sharp currency depreciations; and investors continued to decrea se their holdings in EME mutual funds."
" In response, some EME authorities took actions to support th eir currencies, including tightening monetary policy, modifying capital controls, and purchasing their currencies in foreign exchange markets."
" Equity prices in Germany increased substantially and sovereign yields in the United Kingdom and Germany continued to rise as data on economic activity in Europe generally improved over the period, while yield spreads of Spanish and Italian sovereign securities relative to German government debt declined a bit further."
"Staff Economic Outlook  In the economic forecast prepared by the staff for the September FOMC meeting, the projection for real GDP growth in the second half of this year was revised down a little from the one prepared for the previous meeting."
" The staff’s forecast for real GDP over the medium term also was revised down somewhat, reflecting higher projected paths for both longerterm interest rates and the foreign exch ange value of the dollar, along with slightly lower projected paths for equity and home prices."
" The staff still an ticipated that the pace of expansion in real GDP this year would only moderately exceed the growth rate of po tential output but continued to forecast that real  GDP would accelerate in 2014 and 2015, supported by an eventual easing in the effects of fiscal policy restraint on economic growth, increases in consumer and business sentiment, further improvements in credit availability and financial conditions, and accommodative mo netary policy."
" In 2016, real GDP growth was projected to begin to edge down toward the growth rate of potential output."
" Over the projection period, the expansion in economic activity was anticipated to slowly reduce the slack in labor and product markets, and the unemployment rate was expected to decline gradually."
The staff’s forecast for inflation was little changed from the projection prepared for the previous FOMC meeting.
" In the near term, the staff continued to project that inflation would be modest in the second half of this year but higher than the readings posted in the first half."
" Over the medium term, with longerrun inflation expectations assumed to re main stable, changes in commodity and import prices expected to be modest, and resource slack persisting over most of the projection period, inflation was forecast to be subdued through 2016."
The staff viewed the uncertai nty around the forecast for economic activity as similar to its normal level over the past 20 years.
" The staff did not see the uncertainty around its outlook for inflation as unusually high, and the risks were viewed as balanced."
"Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, meeting participants—5 members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks, all of whom participated in th e deliberations—submitted their assessments of real output growth, the unemMinutes of the Meeting of September 17–18, 2013Page 5_____________________________________________________________________________________________ployment rate, inflation, and the target federal funds rate for each year from 2013 through 2016 and over the longer run, under each participant’s judgment of appropriate monetary policy."
" The longerrun projections represent each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy."
"In their discussion of the economic situation and outlook, meeting participants regarded the information received during the intermeeting period as indicating that economic activity had continued to expand at a moderate pace, albeit somewh at more slowly than earlier anticipated, and they generally indicated that the broad contours of the outlook further out had not changed materially since their July meeting."
" Participants continued to project the rate of growth of economic activity to strengthen over coming years, supported by highly accommodative monetary policy and the gradual abatement of the headwinds that have been slowing the pace of economic recovery, such as  householdsector deleveraging, tight credit conditions for some households and businesses, and fiscal restraint."
" Accordingly, the unemployment rate was projected to continue to decline over time toward levels judged to be consistent with the Committee’s dual mandate."
" While downside risks to the outlook for the economy and the labor market were generally viewed as having diminished, on balance, since last fall, a number of significant risks remained, including those related to the potential economic effects of the sizable increases in interest rates since the spring, ongoing fiscal drag, and the possible fallout from nearterm fiscal debates."
" Inflation continued to run below the Committee’s longerrun objective, apart from fluctuations that largely reflected changes in ener gy prices, and participants generally saw it as moving back gradually to 2 percent in the medium term."
" Auto sales, however, remained strong, supported in part by steady interest rates on auto loans, which, unlike mortgage rates, did not rise substantially in recent months."
" Nonetheless, uncertai nties regarding the outlook for the economy and fiscal and regulatory policies were reportedly continuing to weigh on business decisionmaking, with firms focused on improving their balance sheets and enhancing productivity and still quite cautious about expanding their workforces."
"Participants discussed the extent to which the ongoing tightening in fiscal policy was likely to further restrain economic activity in the second half of this year, with one participant noting that the effects of the federal sequestration appeared to be less pronounced than previously anticipated."
"In discussing labor market developments, a number of participants indicated that ga ins in payrolls in the July and August employment reports were disappointing, but one participant also noted that seasonal adjustment tended to be challenging during the summer months."
 Pa rticipants discussed how to reconcile the notable decline in the unemployment rate over the past year with the only moderate pace of expansion in real GDP.
" One possible explanation was that, to the extent the decline in the unemployment rate was primarily driven by a fa ll in the labor force participation rate and low productivity growth, such a decline might overstate the degree of improvement in broader labor market conditions."
" Indeed, the continued low readings on the employmentto-population ratio were supportive of this explanation, suggesting that overall labor market conditions had not improved as much as the unemployment rate would indicate."
" An alternative explanation for the significant improvement in the labor market performance despite the moderate growth in real GDP over the past year was that growth had been understated somewhat; notably, some research suggested that real gross domestic income, which expanded at a somewhat faster pace than real GDP, may provide better information about overall economic activity."
" Despite recent declines in the unemployment rate, one participant noted the risk that the longer the duration of elevated unemployment, the more likely it was that the labor market and economy would experience some lasting structural  damage."
"Despite the reversal of some transitory factors that had contributed to the earlier softness in inflation, recent readings continued to be below the Committee’s   longerrun objective of 2 percent."
" However, participants generally expected inflation to pick up over the coming year as the pace of economic growth accelerated and slack in resource utilization diminished further, although to a rate still below the Committee’s longerrun objective."
"Participants discussed fina ncial market developments, including their views on the extent to which the rise in longerterm interest rates since May reflected growing confidence about the economic outlook or a perception by financial markets that monetary policy would be less accommodative going forward than had been previously anticipated."
" In any case, however, the assessment of the adverse effects of the increase in longerterm rates on financial conditions and ultimately on economic activity would depend importantly upon the extent to which rates stabilized at cu rrent levels or in stead continued to rise."
"Participants also touched on the implications for financial stability resulting from the increase in interest rates, focusing on the effects on securities held by banking and other nonbank institutions, the unwinding of leveraged trades, and the liquidity and functioning of a number of fixedincome mark ets."
" One participant noted that, notwithstanding the r ecent rise in interest rates, net interest margins remained under pressure at community and regional banks, and as a result many of  these banks continued to add to risk exposures."
" More broadly, a couple of participants noted the complexities related to the interaction between the stance of monetary policy and the vulnerabilities in the financial system."
"In their discussion of the path for monetary policy, participants debated the advantages and disadvantages of reducing the pace of the Committee’s asset purchases at this meeting, focusing importantly on whether the conditions presented to the public in June for reducing the pace of asset purchases had yet been met."
" Many of   these participants had revised down their forecasts for Minutes of the Meeting of September 17–18, 2013Page 7_____________________________________________________________________________________________economic activity or pointed to nearterm risks and uncertainties."
" In particular, concerns were expressed that a delay could potentially undermine the credibility or predictability of monetary policy by, for example, increasing uncertainty about the Committee’s reaction function and about its commitment to the forward guidance for the federal funds rate, with the result of an increase in volatility in financial markets."
" In addition, in an effort to reduce uncertainty abou t how the Committee might adjust its purchases in re sponse to economic developments and to alleviate some of the related communications issues, one participant suggested an approach that would mechanically link the reduction in asset purchases to numerical values for the unemployment rate, with the goal of ending the program when the unemployment rate reached a stated level."
" In part toward this end, participants mentioned se veral possible steps that might be considered, including stating that the Committee would not raise its target for the federal funds rate if the inflation rate was expected to run below a given level or providing additional information on the Committee’s intentions regard ing the federal funds rate after the 6½ percent unemployment threshold was reached."
" One participant stressed that the Committee could use the full range of its tools, including forward guidance, to further improve the alignment of the   mediumterm outlook for employment and inflation with its longerterm goals."
"  In discussing the projections for the target federal funds rate at the end of 2016 as reported in the SEP, some participants highlighted the importance of communicating to the public the reasons why the policy rates that were projected by most, but not all, participants appeared to remain at low levels even as the unemployment rate and inflation by then were expected to be close to their longerrun values."
" In particular, if economic headwinds died away only slowly, as a number of participants expected, the achievement of the Committee’s employment an d price stability objectives would likely require keeping the federal funds rate below its longerrun equilibrium value for some time even as economic conditions improved."
Committee Policy Action Committee members saw the information received over the intermeeting period as suggesting that economic activity was expanding at a moderate pace.
" Some indicators of labor market conditions showed further improvement in recent months, but the unemployment rate remained elevated."
" Household spending and business fixed investment  advanced, and the housing sector was strengthenin g, but mortgage rates had risen further and fiscal policy was restraining growth."
" The Committee expected that , with appropriate policy accommodation, economic growth would pick up from its recent pace, resulting in a gradual decline in the unemployment rate toward levels consistent with the Committee’s dual mandate."
" Apart from fluctuations due to changes in energy prices, inflation was running below the Committee’s longerrun objective, but   longerterm inflation expectations were stable, and the Committee anticipated that inflation would move back toward its objective over the medium term."
"In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members reviewed the degree of improvement in economic activity and la bor market conditions since the asset purchase program began a year ago and judged that, taking into account the extent of federal fiscal retrenchment, the improvement was consistent with growing underlying strength in the broader economy."
" In light of the mixed data recently, including inflation readings that remained below the Committee’s longerrun objective, and the concerns over nearterm fiscal uncertainties, some members indicated that they preferred to await more evidence that their expectation of continuing improvement would be realized."
" In addition, the Committee reaffirmed its intention to keep the target federal funds rate at 0 to      ¼ percent and retained its forward guidance that it anticipates that this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropri ate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6½ percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee’s 2 percent longerrun goal, and longerterm inflation expectations  continue to be well anchored."
" It also acknowledged the improvement in economic activity and labor market conditions since its asset purchase program began, while emphasizing that it was prepared to be patient and await more evidence that progress would be sustained before adjusting downward the pace of purchases."
" The Committee also adopted language to the effect that, in judging when to moderate the pace of asset purchases at its coming meetings, it would assess whether incoming information continued to support its expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and of inflation moving back toward its longerrun objective."
"  At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct  the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: “Consistent with its st atutory mandate, the Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster maximum employment and price stability."
 The System Open Market Account Manager and the Secretary will keep the Co mmittee informed of ongoing developments regarding the System’s balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the Committee’s objectives of maximum employment and price stability.” The vote encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p.m.: “Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in July suggests that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace.
" Some indicators of labor market conditions have shown further improvement in recent months, but the unemployment rate remains elevated."
" Household spending and business fixed investment advanced, and the housing sector has been strengthening, but mortgage rates have risen further and fiscal policy is restraining economic growth."
" Apart from fluctuations due to changes in energy prices, inflation has been running below the Committee’s longerrun objective, but longerterm inflation expectations have remained stable."
"Page 10Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
" The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic growth will pick up from its recent pace and the unemployment rate will gradually decline toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate."
" The Committee recognizes that inflation persistently below its 2 percent objective could pose risks to economic performance, but it anticipates that inflation will move back toward its objective over the medium term."
"Taking into account the extent of federal fiscal retrenchment, the Committee sees the improvement in economic activity and labor market conditions since it began its asset purchase program a year ago as consistent with growing underlying strength in the broader economy."
" Taken together, these actions should maintain downward pressure on longerterm interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative, which in turn should promote a stronger economic recovery and help to ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with the Committee’s dual mandate."
" In judging when to moderate the pace of asset purchases, the Committee will, at its coming meetings, assess whether incoming information continues to support the Committee’s expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back toward its longerrun objective."
"To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee today reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropr iate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens."
" In particular, the Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at  0 to ¼ percent and currently anticipates that this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above  6½ percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee’s 2 percent longerrun goal, and longerterm inflation expectations continue to be well anchored."
" In determining how long to maintain a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy, the Committee will also consider other information, including additional measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings  on financial developments."
" When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced appr oach consistent with its longerrun goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent.” Voting for this action:   Ben Bernanke, William C."
" Accordingly, not only would a reduction be appropriate in light of the ongoing improvement in labor market conditions, but it also would support the credibility and predictability of monetary policy because it would be seen as following through on the Committee’s earlier communications about the outlook for the asset purchase program."
"English Secretary  Page 12Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________Summary of Economic Projections In conjunction with the September 17–18, 2013, Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, meeting participants—5 member s of the Board of Governors and the 12 presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks, all of whom particip ated in the deliberations—submitted their assessments of real output growth, the unemployment rate, inflation, and the target federal funds rate for each year from 2013 through 2016 and over the longer run."
 Each participant’s assessment was based on information available at the time of the meeting plus his or her judgment of appropriate monetary policy and assumptions about the factors likely to affect economic outcomes.
" The longerrun projections represent each participant’s judgment of the value to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy."
 “Appropriate monetary policy” is defined as the future path of policy that each participant deems most likely to foster outcomes for econom ic activity and inflation that best satisfy his or her individual interpretation of the Federal Reserve’s objectives of maximum employment and stable prices.
"Overall, FOMC participants  expected, under appropriate monetary policy, a pickup in economic growth, with the unemployment rate declin ing gradually (table 1 and figure 1)."
" Almost all of th e participants projected that inflation, as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), would rise to a level at or somewhat below the Committee’s 2 percent objective in 2016."
Most participants judged that highly accommodative monetary policy was likely to remain warranted over the next few years to support continued progress toward maximum employment and a return to 2 percent inflation.
"Most participants saw the uncertainty associated with their outlook for economic growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as similar to that of the past 20 years."
" In addition, most participants considered the risks to the outlook for the unemployment rate and inflation as broadly balanced."
" A slim majority of the participants also judged that the risks to the outlook for real gross domestic product (GDP) growth were broadly balanced, while nearly as many indicated that the risks were weighted to the downside."

" Many participants pointed to diminishing restraint from fiscal policy, pentup demand for consumer and producer durables, or rising household net worth as contributing to the pickup in growth."
" In addition, a number of participants noted continued improvement in the housing sector, supported by rising employment and income and by improved credit availability."
"The central tendencies of participants’ projections for real GDP growth were 2.0 to 2.3 percent in 2013,      2.9 to 3.1 percent in 2014, 3.0 to 3.5 percent in 2015, and 2.5 to 3.3 percent in 2016."
" The central tendency for the longerrun rate of growth of real GDP was    2.2 to 2.5 percent, little changed from June."
Participants anticipated a gradual decline in the unemployment rate over the projection period.
" The central tendencies of participants’ forecasts for the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of each year were 7.1 to 7.3 percent in 2013, 6.4 to 6.8 percent in 2014, 5.9 to 6.2 percent in 2015, and 5.4 to 5.9 percent in 2016."
 The central tendency of participants’ estimates of the    longerrun normal rate of unemployment that would prevail under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy was 5.2 to 5.8 percent.
 A majority of participants projected that the unemployment rate would be near or slightly above their individual estimates of its longerrun level at the end of 2016.
Figures 3.A and 3.B show th at participants’ views regarding the likely outcomes for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate in 2014 and 2015 remained dispersed.
" Relative to June, the dispersions of participants’ proj ections for GDP gr owth in 2014 and 2015 narrowed to some extent, while the dispersions of projections for the unemployment rate in those years generally widened a bit."
The Outlook for Inflation Participants’ views on the broad outlook for inflation under the assumption of appropriate monetary policy were little changed from June.
" Although most participants revised up slightly their projection for PCE inflation in 2013, a number of pa rticipants revised down a bit their forecasts for 2014."
" All participants anticipated that both headline and core inflation would rise gradually over the next few years, and almost all participants expected inflation to be at or somewhat below the Committee’s 2 percent object ive in 2016."
" Specifically, the central tendencies for PCE inflation were 1.1 to   1.2 percent in 2013, 1.3 to 1.8 percent in 2014, 1.6 to 2.0 percent in 2015, and 1.7 to 2.0 percent in 2016."
 The central tendencies of the forecasts for core inflation were little changed from June and broadly similar to those for the headline measure over the projection period.
 A number of participants viewed the combination of stable inflation expectations and diminishing resource slack as important factors leading to a gradual pickup in inflation toward the Committee’s longerrun objective.
  Figures 3.C and 3.D provide information on the diversity of participants’ views about the outlook for inflation.
 The ranges of participants’ projections for overall inflation in 2014 and 2015 wi dened slightly from June and were 1.2 to 2.0 percen t in 2014 and 1.4 to 2.3 percent in 2015.
" In 2016, the forecasts for PCE inflation were concentrated near the Committee’s longerrun objective, though one participant expected inflation to be noticeably above the Committee’s objective and another expected it to be ½ percentage point below."
" Similar to the projections for headline inflation, the projections for core inflation became more concentrated near the 2 percent object ive in 2016 than in earlier years; however, the dispersion of the projections for core inflation in each year  was lower than for headline inflation."

"All participants projected that the unemployment rate would be below the Committee’s 6½ percent threshold at the end of the year in which they viewed the initial increase in the federal funds rate to be appropriate, and all but one judged that inflation would be at or below the Committee’s longerrun objective."
 Almost all participants projected that the unemployment rate would still be above their view of its longerrun level at the end of the year in which they saw the federal funds rate increasing from the effective lower bound.
" Among all participants, estimates of the longerrun target federal funds rate ranged from 3¼ to about 4¼ percent, reflecting the Committee’s inflation objective of 2 percent and participants’ individual judgments about the appropriate longerrun level of the real federal funds rate in the absence of further shocks to the economy."
"Participants’ views of the appropriate path for monetary policy were informed by their judgments on the state of the economy, includ ing the values of the unemployment rate and other la bor market indicators that would be consistent with maximum employment, the extent to which the economy was currently falling short of maximum employment, the prospects for inflation to reach the Committee’s longerterm objective of       2 percent, and the balance of risks around the outlook."
 Some participants also mentioned the usefulness of examining the implications of alternative policy strategies for returning employment and inflation to      mandateconsistent levels over the medium term.
" Uncertainty and Risks Most participants judged that the levels of uncertainty about their projections for real GDP growth and unemployment were broadly similar to the norm during the previous 20 years, although four participants continued to see them as higher (figure 4).1  The number of participants who viewed the risks around their GDP projections as weighted to the downside was nearly equal to the number who viewed them as broadly balanced."
 Most participants saw the risks around their unemployment projections as broadly balanced.
" The main factors cited as contributing to the uncertainty and balance of risks around economic outcomes were the limits on the ability of monetary policy at the zero lower bound to respond to adverse shocks, as well as challenges associated with forecasting the path of fiscal policy  and  developments  abroad."
" In  addition, some                                                  1 Table 2 provides estimates of the forecast uncertainty for the change in real GDP, the unemployment rate, and total consumer price inflation over  the period from 1993 through 2012."

Participants reported little change in their assessments of the level of uncertainty and the balance of risks around their forecasts for overall PCE inflation and core inflation.
 Eleven participants judged the levels of uncertainty associated with their forecasts for those inflation measures to be broadly similar to historical norms; the same number saw the risks to those projections as broadly balanced.
" Five participants saw the risks to their inflation forecasts as tilted to the downside, reflecting, for exampl e, the possibility that the current low levels of inflati on could persist and become embedded in inflation expectations."
" Conversely, a couple of participants cited upside risks to inflation stemming from the current highly accommodative stance of monetary policy or concerns about the Committee’s ability to shift to a less accommodative policy stance when it beco mes appropriate to do so."

" As described in the box “Forecast Uncertainty,” under certain assumptions, there is about a 70 pe rcent probability that actual outcomes for real GDP, unemployment, an d consumer prices  will be in ranges implied by the average size of projection errors made in the past."
Page 12Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________       Forecast Uncertainty    The economic projections provided by the members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks inform discussions of monetary policy among policymakers and can aid public understanding of the basis for policy actions.
" Thus, in setting the stance of monetary policy, participants consider no t only what appears to be the most likely economic outcome as embodied in their projections, but also the range of alternative possibilities, the likelihood of their occurring, and the potential costs to the economy should they occur."
"Table 2 summarizes the average historical accuracy of a range of forecasts, including those reported in past Monetary Policy Report s and those prepared by the Federal Reserve Board’s staff in advance of meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee."
" The corresponding 70 percent confidence intervals for overall inflation would be 1.2 to 2.8 percent in the current year, 1.0 to 3.0 percent in the second year, and 0.9 to 3.1 percent in the third and fourth years."
"As with real activity and inflation, the outlook for the future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable uncertainty."
 This uncertainty arises primarily because each participant’s assessment of the appropriate stance of monetary policy depends importantly on the evolution of real activity and inflation over time.
