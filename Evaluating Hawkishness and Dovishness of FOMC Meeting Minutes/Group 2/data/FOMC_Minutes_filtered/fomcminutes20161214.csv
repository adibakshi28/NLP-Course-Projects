" Nominal yields on longer -term U.S. Treasury securities rose substantially over the period, reflecting both higher real yields an d an increase in inflation compensation."
 Market interest rates on overnight repurchase agreements (repos) fell during the intermeeti ng period.
" Market participants pointed to a number of factors contributing to the decline, including lower demands for funding by securities dealers and the ample availability of financing from government- only money market funds (MMFs)."

" Consumer price inflation increased further above its pace early in the year but was still running below the Committee’s longer -run objective of 2 percent, restrained in part by earlier declines in energy prices and in prices of non -energy impor ts."
" Total nonfarm payroll employment increased at a solid pace in October and November, and the unemployment rate declined, reaching 4.6 percent in Nov ember."
" The share of workers employed part time for economic reasons decreased; however, b oth the labor force participation rate and the employmentto-population ratio edged down on net."
 The four -week moving average of initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits remained low.
 Labor productivity in the business sector was flat over the four quarters ending in the third quarter.
" The unemployment rates for African Americans, for Hispanics, and for whites all declined in recent months."
 The unemployment rates for African Americans and for Hispanics remained above the rate for whites but were close to the levels seen just before the most recent recession.
" Recent readings on key factors that influence consumer spending —such as continued gains in employment, real disposable personal income, and households’ net worth—were consistent with moderate real PCE growth for the fourth quarter as a whole."
 The U.S. international trade deficit widened in October after narrowing in September.
 The available trade data suggested  that real net exports  would make a negative contribution to real U.S. GDP growth in the fourth quarter.
" Over the same 12 -month period, total consumer prices as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) rose a bit more than 1½ percent, while core CPI inflation was around 2 percent."
" The Michigan survey measure of median longer -run inflation expectations edged up, on net, in November and early December."
" The measure of longer -run inflation expectations for PCE prices from the Survey of Professional Forecasters was unchanged in the fourth quarter, and measures of longer -run inflation expectations from the Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants were also unchanged in December."
 Foreign real GDP growth rebounded in the third quarter from an unusually subdued pace in the second quarter.
" This bounceback was driven primarily by stronger  economic  growth in Canada and Mexico, two countries where the second -quarter weakness was most pronounced."
" In the advanced foreign economies (AFEs), recent indicators were consistent with a more moderate pace of economic activity in the fourth quarter."
" Economic growth also appeared to slow after its uptick in the third quarter in the emerging market economies (EMEs), as indicators for Mexico suggested a return to a more sustainable pace of economic growth and as investment dec elerated in China."
 Inflation increased in most AFEs in recent months but remained significantly below central bank targets.
" Inflation in the EMEs also moved up, driven largely by a rebound in Chinese food prices and, in some countries, by the effects of currency depreciation."
 A sset price movements as well as changes in the expected pat h for U.S. monetary policy beyond December  appeared to be driven largely by expectations of more expansionary fiscal policy in the aftermath of U.S. elections.
" Nominal Treasury yields rose across the maturity spectrum, and measures of inflation compensati on based on Treasury Inflation -Protected Securities continued to move up."
" Market -based measures of uncertainty regarding monetary policy at horizons beyond one year moved up, suggesting that some of the firming in OIS rates could reflect a rise in term premiums."
 Intermediate - and longer -term yields we re boosted by roughly equal increases in real yields and inflation compensation.
 Measures of inflation compensation extended an upward trajectory that began around midyear.
 Changes in market quotes for inflation caps and floors suggested that the rise in  inflation compensation reflected in part Page 4Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________  higher costs of protection against above -target inflation outcomes.
" The rise in inflation compensation appeared to be spurred in part by the recent climb in oil prices, with a notable jump after OPEC’s agreement a t its November 30 meeting to cut production."
" Broad U.S. equity price indexes rose over the intermeeting period, apparently boosted by investors’ expectations of stronger earnings growth and improved risk sentiment, with much of the rally coming after the U .S."
" Share prices for the financial sector outperformed the broader market, while stock prices in sectors that typically benefit from lower interest rates, such as utilities, underperformed."
" Indicators of supply and demand conditions for small business credit were generally unchanged ove r the past quarter, with demand appearing to remain weak."
 The average rate of growth of CRE loans at banks continued to be strong in October and November.
" The interest rate on 30 -year fixed -rate residential mortgages moved up in line with Treasury yields, although the rate remained low by his torical standards and mortgage availability appeared little changed."
" Currency weakness prompted some EME central banks, such as the Bank of Mexico  and the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey, to tighten monetary policy."
"  However, the Central Bank of Brazil eased monetary policy to support economic growth."
 Real GDP growth in the second half of 2016 was still expected to be faster than in the first half.
" The staff’s forecast for real GDP growth over the next several years was slightly higher, on balance, largely reflecting the effects of the staff’s provisional  assumption that fiscal policy would be more expansi onary in the coming years ."
 These effects  were substantially counterbalanced by the restraint from the higher assumed paths for longer -term interest rates and the foreign exchange value of the dollar.
" The unemployment rate was forecast to edge down gradually, on net, and to continue to run below the staff’s estimate of its longer -run natural rate through the end of 2019; the path for the unemployment rate was a little lower than in the previous projection."
"                                                  6 One participant did not submit longer -run projections for real output growth, the unemployment rate, or the federal funds rate."
" The near -term forecast for consumer price inflation was somewhat higher than in the previous projection, reflecting recent increases in  energy prices."
" Beyond the near term, the inflation forecast was little revised."
" The staff continued to project that inflation would edge up over the next several years, as food and energy prices along with the prices of nonenergy imports were expected to begin steadily rising in 2017."
" However, inflation was projected to be marginally below the Committee’s longer -run objective of 2 percent in 2019."
" The staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as similar to the average of the past 20  years."
" The risks to the forecast for real GDP were seen as tilted to the downside, reflecting the staff’s assessment that monetary policy appeared to be better positioned to offset large positive shocks than substantial adverse ones."
" Consistent with the downside risks to aggregate demand, the staff viewed the risks to its outlook for the unemployment rate as tilted to the upside."
 The risks t o the projection for inflation were seen as roughly balanced.
 The downside risks from the possibility that longer -term inflation expectations may have edged lower or that the dollar could appreciate more than anticipated were seen as roughly counterbalanced by the upside risk that inflation could increase more than expected in an economy that was projected to continue operating above its long -run potential.
"Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook  In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, members of the Board of Governors and Federal Reserve Bank presidents submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real output growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation  for each year from 2016 through 2019  and over the longer run, based on  their individual assessments of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate .6  The longer -run projections represented each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy."
" Page 6Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________  In their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, participants agreed that information received over the intermeeting period indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been expanding at a moderate pace since midyear."
" Job gains had been solid in recent months, and the unemployment rate had declined."
" Inflation had increased since earlier in the year but was still below the Committee’s 2 percent longer -run o bjective, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and in prices of non -energy imports."
" Market -based measures of inflation compensation had moved up considerably but still were low; most survey -based measures of longer -term inflation expectations were little changed, on balance, in recent months."
" Participants expected that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity would expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions would strengthen somewhat further."
" Moreover, participants generally made only modest changes to their forecasts for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation."
" In their discussion of the ir economic forecasts , participants emphasized their considerable uncertainty about the timing, size, and composition of any future fiscal and other economic policy initiatives as well as about how those polic ies might affect aggregate demand and supply."
" Several participants pointed out that, depending on the mix of tax, spending, regulat ory, and other possible policy changes, economic growth might turn out to be faster or slower than they currently anticipated."
" However, almost all also indicated that the upside risks to their forecasts for economic growth had increased as a result of pro spects for more expansionary fiscal policies in coming years."
" In that regard , several noted upside risks to U.S. economic activity  from the potential for better -thanexpected economic growth abroad or an acceleration of domestic business investment."
 Several participants also commented on the uncertainty about the outlook for productivity growth or about the potential effects of tight la bor markets on labor supply and inflation.
" For some participants, the greater upside risks to economic growth, the upward movement in inflation compensation over recent months, or the possibility of further increases in oil prices had increased the upside risks to  their inflation forecasts."
" However, several others pointed out that a further rise in the dollar might continue to hold down inflation."
 Participants generally agreed that they should continue to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments.
" A couple of participants reported plans for a pickup in capital spending by businesses in their Districts, driven by stronger demand and increasing revenues."
" Monthly increases in nonfarm payroll employment averaged nearly 180,000 over the three months ending in November, in line with the average pace of job creation over the past year."
 The unemployment rate dropped markedly to 4.6 percent in November; a few participants suggested that part of the decline might be reversed in coming months.
 Most p articipants viewed the cumulative progress in the labor market as having brought labor market conditions to or close to those consistent with the Committee’s maximumemployment objective.
" Participants expected the labor market to strengthen somewhat further over the medium run, with almost all  anticipating that the unemployment rate over the next couple of years would  run below their estimates of its longer -run normal level."
" Some participants saw the possibility that an extended period during which labor markets remained relatively tight could continue to shrink remaining margins of underutilization, including the stillhigh level of prime -age workers outside the labor force and elevated levels of involuntary part -time employment and long -duration unemployment."
 A few added that continued gradual strengthening in labor markets would help return  inflation to the Committee’s 2 percent objective.
 But some other participants were uncertain that a period of tight labor utilization would yield lasting labor market benefits or were concerned that it risked a buildup of inflationary pressures.
" Most participants expected that if economic growth remained moderate, as they projected, the unemployment rate would be only modestly below their estimates of the longer -run normal rate of unemployment over the next few years , but several anticipated a more substanti al undershoot."
" A  few participants noted the uncertainty surrounding real -time estimates of the longer -run normal rate of unemployment, and it was pointed out that geographic variation in  labor market conditions contributed to that uncertainty ."
" In discussing the possible implications of a more significant undershooting of the longer -run normal rate, many participants emphasized that, as the economic outlook  evolved, timely adjustments to monetary policy could be required to achieve and maintain both the Committee’s maximum -employment and inflation objectives ."
Participants generally viewed the information on inflation received over the intermeeting period as reinforcing their expectation that inflation would rise to the Committee’s 2 percent objective over the medium term.
" Core PCE price inflation had also moved up moderately  over the past year, and , over the 12 months ending in October, it was 1.7 percent for a third consecutive month."
" Median  5to-10year inflation expectations in the Michigan survey were, on balance, stable in November and early December, just above the low recorded in October."
  Market -based measures of inflation compensation had moved up considerably over the intermeeting period.
" A few participants added that other readings from financial markets, such as implied probabilities of various inflation outcomes derived from inflation derivatives, pricing in the inflation swaps market, and the apparent upward shift of the estimated term premium in the 10 -year Treasury yield, suggested that the risks to the inflation outlook had become more balanced around the Committee’s 2 percent infl ation objective."
" Several, however, pointed out that market -based measures of inflation compensation were still low or that downside risks to  inflation remained, given the recent further appreciation of the dollar."
"In their consideration of economic conditions and monetary policy, participants agreed that sufficient evidence had accumulated of continued progress toward the Committee’s objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation to wa rrant a n increase of  25 basis point s in the target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting."
" Participants judged that, even after the increase in the target range, the stance of policy would remain accommodative, consistent with some further strengthening in labor market conditions and a return of inflation to 2 percent over the medium term."
 Most participants j udged that a gradual pace of rate increases was likely to be appropriate to promote the Committee’s objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.
 A gradual pace was also viewed by some participants as likely to be warranted because the proximi ty of the federal funds rate to the effective lower bound placed constraints on the ability of monetary policy to respond to adverse shocks to the aggregate demand for goods and services.
" In addition, the neutral real rate —defined as the real interest rate that is neither expansionary nor contractionary when the economy is operating at or near its potential —still appeared to be low by historical standards, and it was noted that gradual increases in the federal funds rate over the next few years probably wo uld be sufficient to return to a neutral policy stance."
 It was also noted that fiscal and other policies  were only some of the many factors that could influence the economic outlook and thus the appropriate course of monetary policy.
" Pa rticipants noted that, in the circumstances of heightened uncertainty, it was especially  important that the Committee continue to underscore in its communications that monetary policy would continue to be set to promote attainment of the Committee’s statut ory objectives of maximum employment and price stability."
 Many participants judged that the risk of a sizable undershooting of the longer -run normal unemployment rate  had increased somewhat and that the Committee might need to raise the federal funds rate more quickly than currently anticipated  to limit the degree of undershooting and stem a potential  buildup of inflationary pressures .
" However, with inflation still below the Committee’s 2  percent objective, it was noted that downside risks to inflation remain ed and that a moderate undershooting of the longer -run normal unemployment rate could help return inflation to 2 percent."
" Committee Policy Action  In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that the information received since the Committee met in November indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been e xpanding at a moderate pace since midyear."
" Job gains had been solid in recent months, and the unemployment rate had declined."
" Inflation had increased since e arlier this year but was still below the Committee ’s 2 percent longer -run objective, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and in prices of nonenergy imports."
 Market -based measures of inflation compensation had moved up considerably but sti ll were low; most survey -based measures of longer -term inflation expectations were little changed on balance.
" With respect to the economic outlook and its implications for monetary policy, members continued to expect that, with gradual adjustments in the s tance of monetary policy, economic activity would expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions would strengthen somewhat further."
" Some members  saw, with gradual adjustments of the stance of monetary policy, only modest risk of a scenario in which an undershooting of the long errun normal rate of unemployment would create a sharp acceleration in prices."
" These members observed that inflation continued to run below the Committee’s 2 percent objective and that wage gains had been subdued , and they expressed the view that inflation was likely to rise  gradually , giving  monetary policy time to respond if necess ary."
" At this meeting, members continued to expect that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, inflation would rise to the Committee’s 2 percent objective over the m edium term as the transitory effects of past declines in energy prices and non -energy import prices dissipated and the labor market strengthened further."
 This view was reinforced by the rise in inflation in recent months and by recent increases in inflation compensation.
" Against this backdrop and in light of the current shortfall in inflation from 2 percent, members agreed that they would continue to closely monitor actual and expected progress toward the Committee’s inflation goal."
"After assessing the ou tlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, members agreed to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to ½ to ¾ percent."
" This increase in the target range was viewed as appropriate in light of the considerable progress that had  been made toward the Committee’s objective of maximum employment and, in view of the rise in inflation since earlier in the year, the Committee’s confidence that inflation would rise to 2 percent in the medium term."
" Members judged that, even after this increase in the target range, the stance of monetary policy remained accommodative, thereby supporting some further strengthening in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation."
" The Committee agreed that, in determining the timing and size o f future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, it would assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation."
" This assessment would take into account a wide range o f information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below to  be released at 2:00  p.m.: “Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in November indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace since mid -year.
 Job gains  have been solid in recent months and the unemployment rate has declined.
"Inflation has increased since earlier this year but is still below the Committee’s 2  percent longer -run objective, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and in prices of non -energy imports."
"Market -based measures of inflation compensation have moved up considerably but still are low; most survey -based measures of longer -term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance, in recent months."
" Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
" The Committee expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat further."
 Inflation is expected to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of past declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further.
 The Committee continues to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments.
" In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to ½ to ¾ percent."
" The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting some further strengthening in labor mar ket conditions and a return to 2  percent inflation."
" In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of m aximum employment and 2  percent inflation."
" This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and inter national developments."
" In light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2  percent, the Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal."
" To support the Committee’s decision to raise the target range for the federal funds rate, the Board of Governors voted unanimously to raise the interest rates on required and excess reserve balances ¼  percentage point, to ¾ perc ent, effective December 1 5, 2016."
" Page 12Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________    Summary of Economic Projections In conjunction with the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting held on December  13–14, 20 16, meeting participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real output growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation  for each year from 2016 to 2019 and over the longer run.1  Each participant’s projection was based on information available at the time of the meeting, together with his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy, including a path for the federal funds rate and its lon gerrun value,  and assumptions about other  factors likely to affect economic outcomes."
" The longer -run projections represent each participant’s assessment of the value to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy."
 “Appropriate monetary policy” is defined as the future path of policy that each participant deems most likely to foster outcomes for economic activity and inflation that best satisfy his or her individual interpretation of the Federal Reserve’s objectives of maximum employment and stable prices.
" Most FOMC participants  expected that, under appropriate monetary policy, growth in real gross domestic product (GDP) would pick up a bit  next year and  run at or  slightly  above  their individual estimates of its longer -run rate through 2019."
 Almost all participants  projected that the unemployment rate w ould run below their estimates of its longer -run normal level in 2017 and remain below that level t hrough 2019.
"  All participants  projected that inflation, as measured by the four -quarter percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), would increase  over the next two years, and several expected inflation to slightly  exceed  the Committee’s 2 percent objective  in 2018 or 2019."
" As shown in figure 2, almost all participants expected that the evolution of economic conditions would warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate to achieve and sustain maximum  employment and 2 percent inflation ."
" However,  the economic outlook is uncertain, and partic1 One participant did not submit longer -run projections for real output growth, the unemployment rate, or the federal funds rate."
 ipants  noted that their  economic projections and assessments of appropriate monetary policy may change in response to incoming information.
" A majority of participants viewed the level of uncertainty associated with their individual forecasts for economic growth, unemployment, and inflation as broadly similar to the norms of the previous 20 years , though some participants saw uncertainty associated with their forecasts as higher  than average."
"  Most participants also judged the risks around their projections for economic activity , the unemployment rate , and inflation  as broadly balanced, while several participants saw the risks to their  forecasts of real  GDP growth as weighted to the upside and the risks to their unemployment rate forecasts as tilted to the downside ."
"  The Outlook for Economic Activity  The median of participants’ projections for the growth rate of real GDP, conditional on their individual assumptions about appropriate monetary policy, was 1.9 percent in 2016, 2 .1 percent in 2017, 2.0 percent  in 2018, and 1."
9 percent in 2019; the median of projections for the longer -run normal rate of real  GDP growth was 1.8 percent.
 Most participants projected that economic growth w ould pick up a bit in 2017 from the current year’s pace and run at or slightly above their individual estimates of its longer -run rate through 2019.
" Compared with the September Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), the med ians of the projections for real GDP growth were slightly higher over the period from  2017 to 2019, while the median assessment of the longer -run growth rate was unchanged."
" Since  September, almost half of the participants revised up their projections for real GDP growth in 2018 or 2019, generally only slightly."
" Those increasing their projections for output growth in those years cited expected  changes in fiscal, regulatory , or other  policies  as factors contributing to their revisions."
"  However, many partici pants noted that the effects  on the economy  of such policy changes , if implemented,  would likely be partially offset by tighter financial conditions, including higher  longer -term interest rates and a strengthening of the dollar."
" The median of projections for the unemployment rate  in the fourth quarter of 2016 was 4.7 percent, slightly lower than in September."

Projections for the unemployment rate are for the average civilian unemployment rate in the fourthquarter of the year indicated.
Each participant’s projections are based on his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy.
Longerrun projections represent each participant’sassessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy.
"One participant did not submit longerrun projections for the change in real GDP, the unemployment rate, or the federal funds rate in conjunction withthe September 20–21, 2016, meeting, and one participant did not submit such projections in conjunction with the December 13–14, 2016, meeting.1.

" The distributions of projections for the unemployment rate shifted modestly lower for 2016  through 2019, while the distribution of projections for the longer -run normal rate of unemployment was unchange d."
"The Outlook for Inflation  In the December  SEP, the median of projections for headline PCE price inflation in 2016 was 1."
" The median of projections for headline PCE price inflation was 1.9 percent in 2017 and 2 .0 percent in 201 8 and 2019, unchanged from September ."
 Several participants  projected that inflation will slightly  exceed the  Committee’s objective in 2018 or 2019.
" The median s of projections for core PCE price inflation were the same as in September, rising from 1.7 percent in 2016 to 1.8 percent in 2017 and 2 .0 percent in 2018 and 2019."
Figures 3.C and 3.D provide information on the distribution of participants’ views about the outlook for inflation.
 The distribution s of projections for headline  and core PCE price inflation  shifted up  slightly  relative to  projections for the September  meeting.
 Some participants attributed the upward shift in  projected inflation this year and next to recent data that showed somewhat higher inflation  than they had  expected .
 A few saw higher i nflation in 2019 in conjunction  with somewhat greater undershooting of the unemployment rate below its longer -run normal level.
"Appropriate Monetary Policy  Figure 3.E provides the distribution of participants’ judgments regarding the appropriate target for the federal funds rate at the end of each year from 2016 to 2019 and over the longer run.2  All participants saw an increase  of 25 basis points  in the fede ral funds rate at the                                                  2 One participant’s projections for the federal funds rate, real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation were informed by the view that there are multiple possible medium -term regimes for the U.S. economy, that these regimes are persistent, and tha t the economy shifts between regimes in a way December meeting as appropriate."
"  In discussing their December  forecasts, many participants expressed a view that increases in the federal funds rate over the next  few years would likely be gradual in light of a shortterm neutral real interest rate that currently was low—a phenomenon that a number of participants attributed to the persistence of low productivity growth , continued strength of the dollar, a weak outlook for economic growth abroad, strong demand for safe longer -term assets,  or other factors —and that was likely to rise only slowly as the e ffects of these factors faded over time."
" Some participants noted the continued proximity of short -term nominal interest rates to the effective lower bound , even with an  increase at th is meeting,  as limiting the Committee’s ability to increase monetary accommodation to counter possible adverse shocks to the economy ."
" Many p articipants noted that  there was currently substantial uncertainty about the size, composition, and timing of prospective fiscal policy changes, but they also commented that a more expansionary fiscal policy might raise aggregate demand above  sustainable level s, potentially necessitat ing somewhat tighter monetary policy than currently anticipated."
" Furthermore, several participants indicated  that recent inflation data and the continued strengthening in labor market conditions increased their confidence that  inflation would move toward the 2 percent objective, making a slightly firmer path of monetary policy appropriate ."
" Under this view, the economy currently is in a regime characterized by expansion of economic activity with low productivity growth and a low short -term real interest rate, but longer -term outcomes for variables other than inflation cannot be usefully projected."

" The correct time period was 1996 through 2015.)  As described in the box “Forecast Uncertainty,” under certain assumptions, there is about a 70 percent probability that actual outcomes for real GDP, unemployment, and consumer prices will be in ranges implied by the average size of projection errors made in the past."
"  Uncertainty and Risks  The left -hand column of figure 4 shows that , for each variable , a majority of  participants  judged the levels of uncertainty associated with their December  projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, headline inflation , and core inflation  to be broadly similar to the  average of the past 20  years .3  However, more participants than in September saw uncertainty surrounding real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, or inflation as higher than average."
" Many participants mentioned an                                                  3 Table 2 provides estimates of the forecast uncertainty for the change in real GDP, the unemployment rate, and total consumer price inflation over the period from 1996 through 2 015."
"As can be seen in the right -hand  column of figure 4, a majority of participants continued to see the risks to real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, headline inflation, and core inflation as broadly balanced; however,  fewer participants saw risks to econ omic growth and inflation as weighted  to the downside or saw risks to the unemployment rate as weighted to the upside than in September."
"  A number of  participants noted that the prospect of expansionary fiscal policy  had increased the upside risks to economic activity  and inflatio n, and a few assessed the possibility of a reduction in regulation  as posing upside risks to their  forecasts  of economic activity."
" Moreover, some participants judged that the recent rise in market -based measures of inflation compensation suggested that downside risks to inflation had declined."
" However, many also pointed to various sources of downside risk to econo mic activity, such as the limited potential for monetary policy to respond to adverse shocks when the federal funds rate is near the effective lower bound, downside risks in Europe and China, a possible increase in trade barriers, and the possibility of a sharp rise  in financial market volatility in the event that fiscal and other policy changes diverged from market expectations."
" In addition, some participants  pointed to  factors  such as global  disinflationary  trends  and downward pressure on import prices f rom further strengthening of the dollar as sources of downside risk to inflation."

" Thus, in setting the stance of monetary policy, participants consider not only what appears to be the most likely economic outcome as embodied in their projections, but also the range of alternative possibilities, the likelihood of their occurring, and the potential costs to the economy should they occur."
"Table 2 summarizes the average historical accuracy of a range of forecasts, including those reported in past Monetary Policy Report s and those prepared by the Federal Reserve Board’s staff in advance of meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee."
" The corresponding 70 percent confidence intervals fo r overall inflation would be 1.8 to 2.2 percent in the current year, 1.0 to 3.0 in the second year, and 0.9 to 3.1 percent in the third and fourth years."
" As with real activity and inflation, the outlook for the future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable uncertainty."
 This uncertainty arises primarily because each participant’ s assessment of the appropriate stance of monetary policy depends importantly on the evolution of real activity and inflation over time.
