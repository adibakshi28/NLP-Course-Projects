"Wood, Associate Director, Division of International Finance, Board of Governors  3 Attended through the discussion of the review of monetary policy strategy, tools, and communication practices."
"Chen,6 Matthew Nemeth ,6 Joe Peek, and Patricia Zobel , Vice Presidents, Federal Reserve Banks of Chicago, New York, New York, Boston, and New York, respectively   Robert Lerman,6 Assistant Vice President, Federal Reserve Bank of New York   Karel Mertens, Senior Economic Policy Advisor, Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas   Mark Spiegel, Senior Policy Advisor, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco   Review of Monetary Policy Strategy, Too ls, and Communication Practices  Participants continued their discussion related to the ongoing review of the Federal Reserve’s monetary polic y strategy, tools, and communication practices."
" At this meeting, they discussed potential changes to the Committee’s Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy."
" Participants agreed that, in light of fundamental changes in the economy over  the past decade—including generally lower levels of interest rates and persistent disinflationary pressures in the United States and abroad —and given what has been learned during the monetary policy framework review, refining the statement could be helpfu l in increasing the transparency and accountability of monetary policy ."
" Such refinements could also  facilitat e wellinformed decisionmaking by households and businesses, and, as a result, better position the Committee to meet its maximum -employment and pr icestability objectives."
 Participants noted that the Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy serves as the foundation for the Committee’s policy actions and that it would be important to finalize all changes to the statement in the near future .
Staff Review of the Economic Situati on The coronavirus outbreak and the measures undertaken to contain its spread continued to have substantial effects on economic activity in the United States and abroad.
 Consumer price inflation—as measured by the 12 -month percent age change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) through May —remained well below the rates that prevailed early in the year.
" Total nonfarm payroll employment expanded robustly in June, as it did in May, but the gains in those two months offset only about one -third of the jobs lost in March and April."
" The unemployment rate moved down further to 11.1  percent , but it continued to be far above its level at the beginning of the year."
" The unemployment rates for African  Americans, Asians, and Hispanics declined, on balance, over the past two months but remained well above the national average."
 Both the labor force participation rate and the employment -topopula-tion ratio increased further in June.
" Initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits continued to d ecrease, on net, through the middle of July, but the pace of declines had slowed in recent weeks."
" In addition, weekly estimates of private -sector payrolls constructed by the Board ’s staff using data provided by the payroll processor ADP , along with some other highfrequency measures —such as employment at small businesses and job postings —suggested that employment gains had slowed since mid -June but likely were  still strong ."
"Total PCE price inflation was 0.5  percent  over the 12 months ending in May, reflecting both weak aggregate demand and a considerable drop in consumer energy prices."
" Core PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in consumer food and energy prices, was 1.0 percent  over the same 12 -month period."
" In contrast, the trimmed mean measure of  12month PCE price inflation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas was 2.0 percent  in May."
" The consumer price index (CPI) increased 0.6  percent  over the 12 months ending in June, while core CPI inflation was 1.2  percent  over the same period."
 Recent readings on survey -based measures of longer -run inflation expectations were little changed on balance.
" Real PCE rebounded  robustly in May, with particularly strong growth in spending for consumer goods but more moderate gains in expenditures for consumer services."
" However, wage and salary income increased strongly in May, though to a level still below its February value, and unemployment insurance benefits continued to be substantial, leaving the personal saving rate quite elevated."
" Housing -sector activity bounced back strongly in recent months, likely boosted in part by the effects of low interest rates."
" The nominal U.S. international trade deficit widened in May relat ive to April, as exports decreased more than imports."
 Incoming data suggested that foreign economic activity plunged in the second quarter as a result of the coronavirus pandemic and the measures undertaken to contain it.
" In China, where economic activity had collapsed in the first quarter and restrictions were rolled back  earlier than elsewhere, the preliminary GDP release showed that the economy bounced back strongly in the second quarter."
" Inflation rates continued to fall in most foreign economies through June  because of  low energy prices and weak demand, and  measures of inflation expectations remained  subdued."
 Measures of inflation compensation based on Treasury Inflation Protected Securities maturing over the next few years continued to rebound from their sharp drop in midMarch.
" Despite the uptick, both the 5 -year and 10 -year measures of inflation compensation remained below their pre -pandemic levels."
" Broad stock price indexes fluctuated substantially, largely in reaction to news about the pandemic and economic activity, and ended the intermeeting period roughly unchanged."
Risk sentiment abroad fluctuated over the intermeeting period as market participants weighed increasing coronavirus cases in a number of countries against improving economic data releases and ongoing fiscal and monetary policy support.
" Amid tighter lending standards and high credit demand, advances via the Paycheck Protection Program Lending Facility continued to grow over the intermeeting period."
" In contrast, bank lending standa rds for CRE loans tightened further, according to the July SLOOS, and CRE loan growth at banks slowed."
" Credit continued to flow to borrowers with higher credit scores seeking mortgages that met standard conforming loan criteria, and low mortgage interest rates supported elevated ref inancing activity."
 The ratio of business debt to nominal GDP ros e in the first quarter from levels that were already historically high —amid declining profits and deteriorating credit quality —although low interest rates had helped ease firms’ debt servicing burdens.
" Nevertheless, economic activity still appeared to have declined at a historically rapid rate in the second quarter."
" The projected rate of recovery in real GDP, and the pace of declines in the unemployment rate, over the second half of this year were expected to be somewhat less robust than in the previous forecast."
" Those factors included the increasing spread of the coronavirus in the United States since mid -June; the reactions of many states and localities in slowing or scaling back the reopening of their economies, especially for businesses, such as restaurants and bars, providing services that entail personal interactions; and some highfrequency indicators that pointed to a deceleration in economic activity."
" Substantial fiscal policy measures —both enacted and anticipated —along with appreciable support from monetary policy and the Federal Reserve’s liquidity and lending facilities were expected to continue bolstering the economic recovery, although a complete recovery was not expected by year -end."
" Inflation was projected to remain subdued this year, reflecting the substantial amount of slack in resource utilization and the sizable declines in consumer energy prices earlier this year."
" As a result, the rate of  real GDP growth was projected to exceed  potential output growth, the unemployment rate was expected to decline considerably, and inflation was forecast to pick back up over 2021 and 2022."
" In this alternative scenario, an acceleration of the coronavirus outbreak, with another round of strict limitations on social interactions and business operations, was assumed to begin later this year, leading to a decrease in real GDP, a jump in the unemployment rate, and renewed downward pressure on inflation next year."
" Compared wi th the baseline, the disruption to economic activity was more severe and protracted in this scenario, with real GDP and inflation lower and the unemployment rate higher by the end of the mediumterm projection."
" Following sharp declines, economic activity and employment had picked up somewhat in recent months but remained well below levels at the beginning of the year."
 Weaker demand and significantly lower oil prices were holding down consumer price inflation.
" Resumption in economic activity,  as well as  payments to households under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security  (CARES)  Act, had supported household income and consumer expenditures."
" In addition, monetary policy and particularly fiscal policy would also play important roles in supporting business activity."
" In the energy sector, these challenges included stilllow oil demand, excess invento ries, and low oil prices, while in the farm sector they included low prices of some farm commodities, pandemic -related disruptions in some food processing plants, and a significant decline in demand for ethanol."
" Regarding the labor market, many  participant s commented  that the pace of employment gains, which was quite strong in May and June, had likely slowed."
" The pace of declines in initial unemployment insurance claims had slowed in recent weeks, and claims remained at an elevated level."
" In addition, participants emphasized that the labor market was a long way from a full recovery even after the positive May and June employment reports; these reports indicated that , through June, only about one -third of the roughly 22 million loss in  jobs that occurred over  March and April  had been offset by subsequent  gains ."
" They noted that the downturn in employment was concentrated among low erwage and service -sector workers, many of whom were employed in industries most adversely  affected by social -distancing measures."
"In their comments about inflation, participants generally judged that the negative effect of the pandemic on aggregate demand was more than offsetting upward pressures on some prices stemm ing from supply constraints or from higher demand for  certain products , so that the overall effect of the pandemic on pric es was seen as d isinflationary."
 Recent low monthly readings of PCE prices suggested that the 12 -month change measure of PCE price inflation would likely continue to run well below the Committee’s 2  percent  objective for some time.
" Against this backdrop, a few participants noted a risk that longer -term inflation expectations might move below levels consistent with the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent  objective."
 Participants also noted  that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy would likely be needed for some time to support aggregate demand and achieve 2  percent  inflation over the longer run.
" Several risks to the outlook were noted, including the possibility that additional waves of virus outbreaks could result in extended economic disruptions and a protracted period of reduced economic activity."
 Several participants noted potential long errun effects of the pandemic associated with possible restructuring in some sectors of the economy that could slow the growth of the economy’s productive capacity for some time.
" Banks and other financial institutions could come under significant stress, particularly if one of the more adverse scenarios regarding  the spread of the virus and its effects on economic activity was realized."
"In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, participants reaffirmed their commitment to using the Federal Reserve’s full range of tools to support the U.S. economy during this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum  employment and price  stability goals."
" They no ted that the path of the economy would depend significantly on the course of the virus and that the ongoing public health crisis would weigh heavily on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term and posed considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term."
" Furthermore, participants continued to judge that it would be appropriate to maintain this target range until they were confident that the economy had weathered recent events and was on track to achieve the Committee’s maximum  employment and price  stability goals."
" These actions would be helpful in sustaining smooth market functioning, thereby fostering the effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions."
 Participants  discussed the current stance of monetary policy and the circumstances under which they might increase monetary policy accommodation or  clarify their intentions regarding policy.
" Noting the increase in uncertainty  about the economic outlook over the intermeeting period, several  participants  suggested that additional accommodation could be required to promote economic  recovery and return inflation to the Committee’s 2 percent  objective."
"With regard to the outlook for monetary policy beyond this meeting, a number of participants  noted  that providing greater clarity regarding the likely path of the target range for the federal funds rate would  be appropriate  at some point."
" In the context o f outcome -based forward guidance, various participants  mentioned using thresholds calibrated to inflation outcomes, unemployment rate outcomes, or combinations of the two, as well as combinations with calendar -based guidance."
" More broadly, i n discussing the policy outlook, a number of participants observed that  completing a revised Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy would be very helpful in providing an overarching framework that would help guide the Committee’s future p olicy actions and communications."
A majority  of participants commented on yield caps and targets —approaches that cap or target interest rates along the yield curve —as a monetary policy tool.
" Of those participants who discussed this option, m ost judged that yield caps and targets would likely provide only modest benefits in the current environment, as  the Committee’s forward guidance regarding the path of the federal funds rate already appeared highly credible and longer -term interest rates were already low."
" A couple of participants remarked on  the value of yield caps and targets as a means of reinforcing forward guidance on asset purchases , thereby  providing insurance against adverse movements in market expectations regarding  the path of monetary policy , and as a tool that could help limit the amount of asset purchases that the Committee would need to make in pursuing its dualmandate goals."
"  Committee Policy Action  In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that the coronavirus outbreak was causing tremendous human and economic hardship across the United States and around the world."
" Following sharp declines, economic activity and employment had picked up somewhat in recent months but remained well below their levels at the beginning of the year."
 Consumer price inflation was being held down by weaker demand and significantly lower oil prices.
" Members agreed that the Federal Reserve was committed to using its full range of t ools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time , thereby promoting its maximum  employment and price  stability goals."
" In addition, members agreed t hat the ongoing public health crisis would weigh heavily on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term and was posing considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term."

" Members agreed that they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook —including information re lated to public health —as well as global developments and muted inflation pressures, and that they would use the Committee’s tools and act as appropriate to support the economy."
" In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the stance of monetary policy, members noted that they would assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to the Committee’s maximum -employment objective and its symmetric 2  percent  inflation objective."
" This assessment would take into account a wide range of _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of July 28–29, 2020Page 11information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
" To support the flow of credit to households and businesses, members agreed t hat over coming months it would be appropriate for the Federal Reserve to increase its holdings of Treasury securities and agency RMBS  and CMBS  at least at the current pace to sustain smooth market functioning, thereby fostering effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions."
"• Increase the System Open Market Account holdings of Treasury securities, agency mortgage -backed securities (MBS), and agency commercial mortgage -backed securities (CMBS) at least at the current pace to sustain smooth functioning of markets for these securities, thereby fostering effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions."
"” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2:00 p.m.: “The Federal Reserve is committed to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum employment and price stability goals."

" This assessment will take into account a wide  range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
" To support the flow of credit to households and businesses, over c oming months the Federal Reserve will increase its holdings of Treasury securities and agency residential and commercial mortgage -backed securities at least at the current pace to sustain smooth market functioning, thereby fostering effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions."
" Consistent with the Committee ’s decision to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the Board of Governors voted unanimously to leave the interest rates on required and excess reserve balances at 0.10 percent ."
