 Domestic  data releases over the intermeeting period pointed to inflation being more persistent than previously expected and to a generally resilient economy .
" At shorter maturities, the increase appeared to largely reflect higher inflation compensation, while at longer maturities , it was attributable mostly to a higher expected path for the real policy rate and higher real risk premiums."
" Model estimates suggested that inflation expectations rose some , but mostly at shorter horizons ."
 Longer -term inflation expectations appeared to remain well anchored .
" Broad equity prices fell over the period, as hig her interest rates weighed on valuations, while recent earnings reports, which were generally solid, provided some support."
  Staff Review of the Economic Situation  The information available at the time of the April 30 –May 1 meeting indicated that growth in U .S.
 Consumer price inflation —as measured by the 12month change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE)—slowed significantly over the past year but had moved up slightly in recent months and remained above 2  percent .
"  Labor demand and supply continued to move into better balance, though the speed of this realignment appeared to have slowed in recent months ."
 Total nonfarm payroll employment increased at a faster average monthly pace in the first quarter of 2024 than in the fourth quarter of 2023.
" The unemployment rate ticked down to 3 .8 percent in March, while the labor force participation rate and the employmentto-population ratio both moved up 0.2 percent age point."
" The unemployment rate for African Americans increas ed, and the rate for Hispanics moved down; both rates were higher than those for Asians and for Whites ."
" The 12 -month changes in the employment cost index (ECI) and average hourly earnings for all employees both declined in March relative to a year earlier, but the 3month change in the ECI stepped up noticeably from the average pace that prevailed over the second half of 2023."
"  Regarding consumer price inflation, total PCE prices increased 2 .7 percent  over the 12 months ending in March, while core PCE price inflation —which excludes changes in energy prices and many consumer food prices —was 2.8 percent  over the same period ."
 Both inflation measures were considerably lower than their year -earlier levels but had  surprised to the upside.
" Al though  some measures of shortterm inflation expectations had moved up, longer -term expectations were little changed and stood at levels consistent with those that prevailed before the pandemic ."
" All told, net exports made a significant negative contribution to U.S. GDP growth in the first quarter ."
  Foreign GDP growth is estimated to have picked up in the first quarter from its subdued pace in the previous quarter .
" In Europe, economic activity resumed expanding following modest contractions in several economies amid monetary policy restraint and the repercussions of the 2022 energy shock ."
" Growth stepped up in China, led by strong exports, but property -sector indicators remained weak ."
" Elsewhere in emerging Asia, exports rebounded further from last year’s lows, lifted by robust global demand for high -tech goods ."
"  Headline inflation eased modestly further in the advanced foreign economies (AFEs) in the first quarter, but inched up in the emerging market economies in part because of  food price  pressure caused by adverse weather in some countries ."
" Consistent with the rise in the implied policy path, nominal Treasury yields at all maturities also rose substantially as investors appeared to reassess the persistence of inflation and the implications for monetary pol icy."
 Market -based measures of interest rate uncertainty remained elevated by historical standards .
" In contrast, interest rates on new credit card offers edged down in February ."
 Interest rates on small business loans increased in March and remained at elevated levels.
" The growth of bank CRE loan balances slowed notably over the past year, reflecting the tightening of credit standards over this period, though growth of CRE loan balances picked up modestly in the first quarter."
" Growth in auto lending moderated in January and February, and a modest net share of banks reported in the SLOOS that they tightened lending standards on auto loans in the first quarter ."
" However, the staff also noted the growing connections between _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of April 30–May 1, 2024Page 5 private credit and the banking sector, the growth of  some forms of private credit, and the fact that the private credit market has yet to experience a severe credit downturn."
" The economy was expected to maintain its high rate of resource utilization over the next few years, with projected output growth roughly similar to the staff’s estimate of potential growth."
" The unemployment rate was expected to edge down slightly over 2024 as labor  market functioning improved further, and to remain roughly steady thereafter ."
"  Total and core PCE price inflation were both projected to move lower this year  relative to last  year, though the expected pace of disinflation was slower than in the March projection , as incoming data pointed to more persistence  in inflation in coming months ."
" Inflation was expected to decline further beyond this year as demand and supply in product and labor markets continued to move into better balance; by 2026, total and core PCE price inflation were expected to be close to 2  percent ."
" Risks to the inflation forecast were seen as tilted to the upside, reflecting the possibility that supply -side disruptions or unexpectedly persistent inflation dynamics could materialize."
" The risks around the forecast for economic activity were seen as skewed to the downside on the grounds that more -persistent inflation could result in tighter financial conditions than in the staff’s baseline projection; in addition, deteriorating household financial positions, especially for lower -income households, might prove to be a larger drag on activity than the staff anticipated ."
"  Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook  Participants observed that while inflation had eased over the past year, in recent months there had been a lack of further progress toward the Committee’s 2 percent  objective ."
 The recent monthly data had showed  significant increases in components of both goods and services price inflation.
" In particular, inflation for core services excluding housing had moved up in the first quarter compared with the fourth quarter of last year, and prices of core goods posted their first three -month increase in several m onths ."
" In addition, housing services inflation had slowed less than had been anticipated based on the  smaller  increases in measures of market rents  over the past year ."
" A few participants remarked  that unusually large seasonal patterns could have contributed  to January’s large increase  in PCE inflation , and several  participants noted that some components  that typically display volatile price changes had boosted recent readings ."
" However, some participants emphasized that the recent increases in inflation had been relatively broad based and therefore should not be overly discounted."
  Participants generally commented that they remained highly attentive to inflation risks .
" They  also remained concerned that elevated inflation continued to harm the purchasing power of households, especially those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation."
  Participants noted that they continued to expect that inflation would return to 2  percent  over the medium term.
" However, recent data had not increased their confidence  in progress toward 2 percent and , accordingly,  had suggested that the disinflation process would likely take longer than previously thought."
" Participants discussed several factors that, in conjunction with appropriately restrictive monetary policy, could support the return of inflation to the Committee’s goal  over time."
 One was a further reduction in housing services price inflation as lower readings for rent growth on new leases continued to pass through to this category of inflation.
" Several participants stated that core nonhousing services  price inflation could resume its decline as wage growth slows further  with labor demand and supply moving into better balance, aided by higher  labor force participation and strong immigration flows ."
" In addition, many participants commented that ongoing increases in productivity growth would support disinflation  if sustained , though the outlook for productivity growth was regarded as uncertain ."
" Although some measures of shortterm inflation expectations from surveys of consumers  had increased in recent months, m edium - and longer -term measures of expected inflation had remained well anchored, which was seen as crucial for meeting the Committee’s inflation goal on a sustained basis ."
" While supply chain improvements had supported disinflation for goods prices over the previous year, participants commented that an expected more gradual pace of such improvements could slow progress on Page 6Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ inflation ."
 Several participants commented that growth of aggregate demand  would  likely have to slow from its strong pace in recent quarters for inflation to move sustainably toward the Committee’s goal .
"  Participants assessed that demand and supply in the labor market, on net, were continuing to come into better balance,  though at a slower rate ."
" Nevertheless, they saw conditions as having generally remained tight  amid  recent strong payroll growth and a still -low unemployment rate."
 Many participants commente d that the better balance between labor demand and supply had contributed to an easing of nominal wage pressures .
"Even so, a number of participants noted that some measures of labor cost growth, including the ECI , had not eased in recent months , and a couple of participants remarked  that negotiated compensation agreements had added to wage pressures in their D istricts."
 Participants further commented that recent estimates of greater immigration in the past few years and an overall increase in labor supply could help explain the strength in employment gains even as the unemployment rate had remained roughly flat and wage pressures had eased.
  Participants noted that recent indicators suggested that economic activity had continued to expand at a solid pace.
" Real GDP growth in the first quarter had moderated relative to the second half of last year, but PDFP  growth maintained a strong pace ."
" High interest rates appeared to weigh on consumer durables purchases  in the first quarter , and growth of business fixed investment remained modest."
" Despite the high  interest rates, residential investment grew more strongly in the first quarter than its modes t pace in  the second half of last year."
"  Although recent PDFP  data suggested continued  strong economic momentum, participants generally did not interpret the data as indicating a further  acceleration of activity  and expected that GDP growth would slow from last year’s strong pace."
 A number of participants commented that high rates of immigration could  support economic activity by boosting labor supply and contributing to aggregate demand .
 Participants noted the important influence of productivity growth for the economic outlook .
 Some participants suggested that the recent increase in productivity growth might not persist because it reflected  onetime adjustments to the level of productivity or reflected continued elevated volatility  in the data over the past several years .
 A few participants commented that higher productivity growth might be sustained by the incorporation of technologies such as artificial intelligence into existing business operations or by high rates of new business formation in the technology sector .
"In their discussion of the outlook for the household sector, participants observed that consumer spending remained firm in the first quarter, supported by low unemployment and solid income growth."
" A number of participants judged that consumption growth was likely to moderate this year, as growth in labor income was expected to slow and the financial positions of many households were expected to weaken ."
"Business contacts in many Districts reported a steady or stable pace of economic activity, while contacts in a couple of Districts conveyed increased optimism about the outlook ."
" They  generally noted their uncertainty about the persistence of inflation and agreed that recent data had not increased their confidence that _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of April 30–May 1, 2024Page 7 inflation was moving sustainably toward  2 percent ."
" Some participants pointed to geopolitical events or other factors resulting in more severe supply bottlenecks or higher shipping costs, which could put  upward pressure on prices and weigh on economic growth."
 The possibility that geopolitical events could generate commodity price increases was also seen as an upside risk to inflation.
 A number of participants noted uncertaint y regarding the degree of restrictiveness of current financial conditions and the  associated risk that such conditions were  insufficiently  restrictive on aggregate demand and inflation.
" Several participants commented that increased efficiencies and technological innovations could raise productivity growth  on a sustained basis, which might allow the economy to grow faster without raising inflation."
" Participants also noted downside risks to economic activity, including slowing economic growth in China, a deterioration in conditions in domestic CRE markets, or a sharp tightening in financial conditions ."
 Participants generally noted that high interest rates could contribute to vulnerabilities in the financial system .
" In that context, a number of participants emphasized that monetary policy should be guided by the outlook for employment and inflation and that other tools should be the primary means to address financial stability risks ."
"  In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, all participants judged that, in light of current economic conditions and their implications for the outlook for employment and inflation, as well as the balance of risks, it was appropriate to mai ntain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5¼ to 5½  percent ."
 Participants assessed that maintaining the current target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting was supported by intermeeting data indicating continued solid economic growth  and a lack of further progress toward the Committee’s 2  percent  inflation objective in recent months.
 Various participants emphasized  that the decision to slow the pace of runoff does not have implications for the stance of monetary policy .
 Many participants commented that the public appeared to have a good understand ing of  the Committee’s datadependent approach in formulating monetary policy and its commitment to achieving its dualmandate Page 8Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ goals of maximum employment and price stability .
" Participants noted disappointing readings on inflation over the first quarter and indicators pointing to strong economic momentum, and assessed that it would take longer than previously anticipated for them  to gain greater confidence that inflation was moving sustainably toward 2  percent ."
"  In discussing risk -management considerations that could bear on the policy outlook, participants generally assessed that risks to the achievement of the Committee’s employment and inflation goals had moved toward better balance over the past year ."
 Participants remained highly attentive to inflation risks and noted the uncertainty associated with the economic outlook .
" Although monetary policy was seen as restrictive, many participants commented on their uncertainty about the  degree of restrictiveness ."
" These participants saw this uncertainty as coming from the possibility that high interest rates may be having smaller effects than in the past, that longer -run equilibrium interest rates may be higher than previously thought, or that the level of potential output may be lower than estimated."
" Participants assessed, however, that monetary policy remained well positioned to respond to evolving economic conditions and risks to the outlook ."
 Participants discussed maintaining the current restrictive policy stance for longer should inflation not show signs of moving sustainably toward 2  percent  or reducing policy restraint in the event of an unexpected weakening in labor market conditions .
 Various participants mentioned a willingness to tighten policy further should risks to inflation materialize in a way that such an action became appropriate.
