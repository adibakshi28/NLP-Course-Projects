 3 Attended through the discussion of the review of the monetary policy framework.
Adjust somewhat in exceptional circumstances the stance of  monetary policy and to take actions that may result in material changes in the composition and size of the assets in the SOMA; or  B.
" Any such adjustment described in subparagraph A of this paragraph  5 shall be made in the context of the Committee’s discussion and decision about the stance of policy at its most recent m eeting and the Committee’s longrun objectives to foster maximum employment and price stability, and shall be based on economic, financial, and monetary developments since the most recent meeting of the Committee."
" __________________________ 1 In general, as speci fied in Article IV, each member of the IMF undertakes to collaborate with the IMF and other members to assure orderly exchange arrangements and to promote a stable system of exchange rates."
 These obligations include seeking to direct the member’s economic and financial policies toward the objective of fostering orderly economic growth with reasonable price stability.
 These obligations also include avoiding manipulating exchange rates or the international monetary system in such a way that would impede eff ective balance of payments adjustment or to give an unfair competitive advantage over other members.
" Review of Monetary Policy Strategy, Too ls, and Communication Practices  Participants  continued their discussion related to the ongoing review of the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy strategy, tools, and communication practices."
" At this meeting, the discussion focused on two topics :  the potential interactions between monetary policy and financial stability and the potential use of inflation ranges around the Committee’s 2 percent inflation objective."
" The staff briefing on the first topic  noted that in the current environment of low neutral rates , achieving the Committee’s dualmandate goals of maximum employment and price stability would require low policy rates frequently , regardless of the monetary policy stra tegy and tools chosen."
" Consequently, policy strategies and tools tha t help support a stronger economy and anchor inflation expectations  at a level consistent with the Committee’s objective in a low -neutral -rate environment can  help promote financial stabi lity."
 The staff noted that clear communications of Page 8Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________the Committee’s ongoing assessments of the interactions between monetary policy and financial stability could help avoid large interest rate surprises that could otherwise contribute to financial vulnerabilities .
" The briefing concluded with a short  review of how other  central banks have approached this issue, including the  use of financial instability escape clauses  to provide leeway for the cent ral bank to deviate from its usual monetary policy strategy if financial vulnerabilities become significant."
"  In their discussion of the effects that alternative monetary policy strategies and tools might have on financial stability, participants noted that macroeconomic stability and the achievement of the Committee’s dual  mandate  depended on a stable financial system."
 An unstable financial system may amplify shocks to the economy and exacerbate increases in unemployment or drive inflation further away f rom the Committee’s goal.
" With respect to the relationship between monetary policy and financial stability , some participants noted that evidence regarding the link between the policy stance and elevated financial vulnerabilities was  limited , with a couple  of participants further observ ing that there were not many episodes of persistently low interest rates ."
" In addition , some past episodes of heightened financial vulnerabilities were associated with excessive risk -taking behavior that did not seem  to be very responsive to typical changes in interest rates ."
" Some  participants remarked, however, that keeping policy rates low to achieve both of the Committee’s dualmandate objectives may contribute to a buildup of financial vulnerabilities, especially at times when the economy is at or above full  employment, a development that could pose future risks to the economy and to the ability of the Committee to achieve its dual mandate."
 Participants discussed  how financial stability considerations should be incorporated in the conduct of monetary policy.
 A few  participants commented that this is especially the case when addressing risks associated with struct ural features such as the current low level of neutral interest rates.
" Recognizing these limitations, many  participants remarked that the Committee should not rule out the possibility of adjusting the stance of monetary policy to mitigate financial stability risks, particularly when those risks have important implications for the economic outlook and  when macroprudential tools had been or were likely to be ineffective at mitigating those risks ."
" Nevertheless,  many participants noted that the current knowledge of the interactions between the stance of monetary policy  and financial vulnerabilities is  too imprecise to warrant systematically adjusting monetary policy in response to the evolution of financial stability risks."
" As a result, monetary policy should be guided primarily by the outlook for employment and inflation, and it should respond to financial stability risks only insofar as such risks significantly threaten the achievement of the Committee’s mandate."
" Several  participants observed that the monetary policy measures needed to curb financial stability risks could be quite large, and the resulting effects on employment and inflation could place a high hurdle for such measures ."
" Some  participants remarked that, because financial stability risks are a consideration for achieving the Committee’s dual mandate, a clear communications strategy would be needed to convey the Committee’s assessments of financial vulnerabilities and their potential implications for the monetary policy outlook ."
  The staff ’s briefing on considerations regarding the use of an inflation range focused on three different concepts of an inflation range.
" First, an unc ertainty  range could communicate the magnitude of the inherent variability of inflation that would still be consistent with achieving the Committee’s  symmetric inflation objective."
" Second, an operational  range could signal that, under some conditions, the  Committee would prefer inflation to be away from its longer -run objective for a time; such a range could potentially be used as part of a makeup policy strategy, including one based on  average inflation targeting, or in other strategies aimed at offsetting the adverse _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of January 28–29, 2020Page 9effects of a binding effective lower bound on policy rates."
" Third, an indifference  range could communicate that monetary policy would not respond to deviations of inflation within that range."
"  The briefing also summarized the experiences of foreign central banks that use inflation ranges; these ranges were typically put in place many years ago, often in conjunction with adopting an inflation target."
 The staff highlighted the communications challenge s that could arise if  an inflation range were introduced at a time when inflation had been running below the central bank’s objective for a number of years.
"In this environment, the introduction of a symmetric range around the point objective  could be misinterpreted as a sign that the central bank  was not concerned about inflation remaining  below it s stated  goal, a situation that could lead to inflation expectations drifting down to the lower end of the range."
 Participants expressed a range of views on the potential benefits and costs of different types of inflation ranges.
  Most  participants expressed concern that introducing a symmetric inflation range around the 2 percent objective following an extended period of inflation mostly running somewhat below 2 percent could be misperceived  as a signal that the Commi ttee wa s comfortable with continued misses below its symmetric inflation objective.
  Many participants agreed that an uncertainty  range could be misinterpreted as an indifference range and hence as a lack of commitment by the Committee to its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective.
 Some  participants suggested that it was not clear that introducing a range would help much in achieving the Committee’s inflation  objective ; they noted that introducing a range  could make that objective less clear to the public .
" Instead of establishing  a range, the Committee could continue to communicate that its inflation objective was symmetric around 2 percent."
" W hile inflation is inherently variable, the Committee then could emphasize its intention for inflation to  be centered on the 2 percent objective."
" Nevertheless, in view of the inherent variability of inflation, several  participants judge d that there could be some benefit in communicating the inflation objective with a symmetric range around the point target."
" In addition, a few participants suggested that an inflation range could convey the uncertainty associated with the available  array of inflation measures  or that the Committee’s communications could more explicitly reference  other measures of inflation ."
" Several  participants also stated that  employing an asymmetric operational range for a time —with 2  percent being at or near the lower end of that range —while still maintaining the longer -run target of 2  percent could help communicate that the Committee intended inflation to average 2 percent over time , which in turn could help keep long errun inflation expectations at levels consistent with  its objective."
" Participants expected that, at upcoming meetings, they would continue their deliberations on the Committee’s review of monetary policy strategy, tools, and communication practices."
" For most of the period, risk asset prices rose as market participants focused on a perceived reduction in downside risks to the economic outlook, favorable data on foreign economic activity, and expectations of continued monetary policy accommodation in the U nited Stat es and other major economies."
"  Despite signs of reduced risks to the outlook and of some stabilization in economic activity abroad, financial market participants’ views on the likely course of U.S. monetary policy appeared to have changed little over the intermeeting period."
" In the second quarter, the manager expected reserve conditions to support slowing the pace of Treasury bill purchases, with the goal of eventually aligning growth of the Federal Reserve’s Treasury holdings with trend growth in its liabilities."
" With this adjustment, the Board would lift the interest rates on required and excess reserves by  5 basis points , and the FOMC would implement an equal -sized upward adjustment to the overnight reverse repurchase agreement offer rate."
" Consumer  price inflation, as measured by the 12 -month percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), remained below 2  percent in November."
 Survey -based measures of longer -run inflation expectations were little changed.
" Total nonfarm payroll employment rose in December, and the solid pace of job gains over the second half of 2019 was somewhat above that for the first half."
" However, the rate of increase in payrolls in 2019 was slower than in 2018, whether or not one accounted  for the anticipated effects of the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ benchmark revision to payroll employment, which was scheduled for early  February."
" The unemployment rate held steady at its 50 -year low of 3.5  percent in December, and the labor force participation  rate and the employment -topopulation ratio were unchanged as well."
" The unemployment rates for African Americans, Asians, Hispanics, and whites were below their levels at the end of the _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of January 28–29, 2020Page 11previous economic expansion."
 The four -week moving average of initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits through mid -January remained near historically low levels.
" Nominal wage growth was moderate, with average hourly earnings for all employees increasing 2.9 percent over the 12 months ending in December."
 Core PCE price inflation (which excludes changes in consumer food and energy prices) was 1.6 percent over that same 12 -month period.
" Consumer food price inflation was lower than core inflation, and consumer energy prices declined."
 The trimmed mean measure of 12 -month PCE price inflation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas remained at 2  percent in November.
" Recent readings on survey -based measures of longer -run inflation expectations were little changed, on balance, in recent months."
" However, key factor s that influence consumer spending —including the low unemployment rate, the upward trend in real disposable income, high levels of households’ net worth, and generally low interest rates —remained supportive of solid real PCE growth in the near term."
" Al though  some measures of business sentiment improved, analysts’ expectations of firms’ longer -term profit growth edged down further, concerns about trade developments continued to weigh on firms’ investment decisions, and reduc ed deliveries of the Boeing 737 M ax were likely restraining investment."
 Real net exports were estimated to have provide d a substantial boost to real GDP growth in the fourth quarter.
   Incoming data suggested that foreign economic growth slowed further in the fourth quarter to a very subdued pace.
" In the advanced foreign economies (AFEs), growth appeared to have remained weak as the manufacturing slump continued and a consumption tax hike in Japan led to a sharp contraction in household spending."
" In the emerging economies, social unrest weighed heavily on economic activity in Hong Kong and Chile, while the labor strike at General Motors  was a further drag on Mexico’s already weak economy."
" In contrast, early GDP releases showed a pickup in growth in China and some other Asian economies , though news of the coronavirus outbreak raised questions about the sustainability of that pickup ."
" Foreign inflation rose in the wake of temporary factors in India and China, while it remained soft in most AFEs , in part reflecting previous declines in energy prices and muted core inflation pressures."
" Staff Review of the Financial Situation  Investor sentiment improved, on balance, over the intermeeting period, mostly reflecting progress related to the phase -one trade deal between the United States and China and its subsequent signing, the perception that the probability of a disorderly Brexit had declined, signs of stabilization in the global economic outlook, and, reportedly, continued  confidence that monetary policy in the United States and other major economies would remain accommodative in the near term."
 Financing conditions for businesses and households eased a bit further and generally remained supportive of spending and economic activity.
" Measures of inflation compensation over the next 5 years and 5 to 10 years ahead based on Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities decreased, on net, but remained above their October 2019 lows."
" For most of the intermeeting period, foreign equity prices rose amid progress on U.S. –China trade negotiations , generally favorable data on global economic activity, and the re duced risk of a disorderly Brexit following the U.K. general election."
" Respondents to the January 2020 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Surve y on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS) reported that borrower demand weakened for C&I loans over the fourth quarter, and lending standards on such loans were little changed."
" The volume of agency and non -agency commercial mortgage-backed securities issuance grew notably in the fourth quarter, buoyed by lower inter est rates, and the growth of CRE loans on banks ’ books picked up over this period."
 Responses to the January 2020 SLOOS suggested that lending standards and demand for most CRE loan categories were unchanged in the fourth quarter.
"  Financing conditions in consumer credit markets remained supportive of growth in consumer spending, although the supply of credit remained relatively tight for nonprime borrowers."
" The growth of credit card balances slowed in the fourth quarter, and, according to the January SLOOS, commercial banks tightened their standards on credit card loans over this period."
 Auto loan growth maintained a solid pace in recent months amid declining interest rates through ye arend.
 Staff Economic Outlook  The projection for U.S. real GDP growth prepared by the staff for the January FOMC meeting was stronger than in the previous forecast.
" Data pertaining to the fourth quarter of 2019, particularly on imports, suggested output rose faster at the end of the year than was previously projected, and this faster pace seemed consistent with the solid employment gains in the fourth quarter."
" All told, real GDP growth was projected to be about the same in 2020 as in 2019 and then to slow modestly in th e coming years, partly because of a fading boost from fiscal policy."
 Output was forecast to expand at a rate a little above the staff’s estimate of its potential rate of growth in 2020 and 2021 and then to slow to a pace slightly below potential Page 14Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________output gr owth in 2022.
 The unemployment rate was projected to decline a little further this year and to remain at that lower level through 2022; the unemployment rate was anticipated to be below the staff’s estimate of its longer -run natural rate throughout the fo recast period.
The staff’s forecasts for both total and core PCE price inflation over the 2020–22 period were essentially unrevised.
 Core inflation was still projected to step up a little in 2020 but to run a bit below 2  percent both this year and over the next two years.
 Total PCE price inflation was projected to be a little lower than core inflation in 2020 because of  a projected decline in consumer energy prices and to be the same as core inflation in 2021 and 2022.
" The staff continued to view the uncertainty around its projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as generally similar to the average of the past 20 years."
" The staff viewed the downside risks to economic activity as having dimin ished  a bit further since the previous forecast but still judged that the risks to the forecast for real GDP growth were tilted to the downside, with a corresponding skew to the upside for the unemployment rate."
" In addition, softness in business inve stment and manufacturing production last year, as well as the recent weakness in imports, w as seen as pointing to the possibility of a more substantial slowing in economic growth than the staff projected."
" The risks to the inflation projection were also viewed as having a downward skew, in part because of the downside risks to the forecast for economic activity."
 Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook  Participants agreed that the labor market had remained strong over the intermeet ing period and that economic activity had risen at a moderate rate.
" Job gains had been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate had remained low."
" On a 12month basis, overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy were running below 2  percent."
 Market -based measures of inflation compensation remained low; survey -based measures of longer -term inflation expectations were little changed.
" Participants generally judged that the current stance of monetary policy was appropriate to support sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation returning to the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective."
" They expected economic growth to continue at a moderate pace, supported by accommodative monetary and financial conditions."
" In addition, some trade uncertainties had diminished recently, and there were some signs of stabili zation in global growth."
" In their discussion of the household sector, participants noted that spending growth had moderated in the fourth quarter."
" Looking ahead, participants were generally cautiously optimistic about the effects  on the business sector of the recent favorable trade developments and the signs of stabilization in  global growth."
" Many participants  expressed the view that these developments  might boost business confidence or raise export demand , which would help strengthen or at least stabilize business investment."
" Participants judged that conditions in the labor market remained strong, with the unemployment rate at a 50year low and continu ed solid job gains, on average."
" Although the upcoming annual benchmark revision was expected to reduce estimates of recent payroll growth , participants expected payroll employment to expand at a healthy pace this year."
" Business contacts in many Districts indicated continued strong labor demand, with several participants  mentioning that contacts reported difficulties in finding qualified workers  or that observed wage growth might currently understate the degree of tightness in the labor market."
" However, a number of participants indicated that aggregate measures of nominal wages continued to rise at a moderate pace broadly in line with productivity growth and the rate of inflation."
" Several  participants  commented on potential reasons for the absence of stronger broad -based wage pressures, including technological changes that could substitute for labor, increased willingness of employees to forgo wage gains for greater job stability, adjustments in nonwage portions of compensation packages, and the possibility that the labor market was not as tight as the historically low unemployment rate would suggest."
" In their discussion of inflation developments, participants noted that recent readings on overall and core PCE price inflation, measured on a 12 -month basis, had continued to run below 2 percent."
" Overall, participants described their inflation outlook as having changed little since December."
 Participants generally expected inflation to move closer to 2 percent in the coming months as the unusually low readings in early 2019 drop out of the 12 -month calculation.
" Participants also expected that, as the economic expansion continues and resource utilization remains high, inflation would return to the 2 percent objective on a sustainable bas is."
" A few p articipants  expressed less confidence in th is outlook for inflation and commented that inflation had averaged less than 2 percent over the past several years even as resource utilization had increased, or pointed to downward pressures from g lobal or technology -related factors that could continue  to suppress inflation ."
" A couple of participants, however, noted  that some alternative  inflation indicators, including trimmed  mean measures, suggested that there had been a modest step -up in underlying inflation during 2019  or that underlying inflation could already be at a level consistent with the Committee’s goal ."
"Participants generally saw the distribution of risks to the outlook for economic activity as somewhat more favorable than at the  previous meeting, although  a number of downside risks remained prominent."
 The easing of trade tensions resulting from the recent agreement with China and the passage of the USMCA as well as  tentative signs of stabilization in global economic growth helped reduce downside risks and appeared to buoy business sentiment.
" Still, participants generally expected trade -related uncertainty to remain somewhat elevated, and they were mindful of the possibility that the tentative signs of  stabilization in global growth could fade."
" The t hreat of the coronavirus, in addition to its human toll, had emerged as a new risk to the global growth outlook, which participa nts agreed warranted close watching."
" S ome participants expressed the concer n that financial imbalances —including overvaluation and excessive indebtedness —could amplify an adverse shock to the economy , that the current conditions of low interest rates and labor market tightness could increase risks to financial stability , or that cyber attacks could affect the U.S. financial system ."
 Several participants  noted  that planned increases in  dividend payouts by large banks and the associated decline in capital buffers might leave those banks with less capacity to weather adverse shocks —which could have negative implications for the economy —or that lower bank capital Page 16Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ratios could be associated with greater tail risks to GDP growth .
"In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, participants judged that it would be appropriate to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1½ to 1¾ percent to support sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market  conditions, and inflation returning to the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective."
" With regard to monetary policy beyond this meeting, participants viewed the current stance of policy as likely to remain appropriate for a time, provided that incoming information about the economy remained broadly consistent with this economic outlook."
" Of course,  if developments emerged that led to a material reassessment of the outlook, an adjustment to the stance of monetary policy would be appropriate, in order to foster achievement of the Committee’s dual -mandate objectives."
" In commenting on the monetary policy outlook, participants concurred that maintaining the current stance of policy would give the Committee time for a fuller assessment of the ongoing effects on economic activity of last year’s shift to a more accommodative policy stance and would also allow policymakers to accumulate fur ther information bearing on the economic outlook."
 Participants discussed how maintaining the current policy stance for a ti me could be helpful in supporting U.S. economic activity and employment in the face of global developments that have been weighing on spending decisions.
" With regard to the Committee’s  price -stability objective, participants  observed that the current degree of monetary policy accommodation would be useful in facilitating a return of inflation to 2 percent."
 Several  participants noted that inflation returning to 2 percent would help ensure that longer -term inflation expectations remained  consistent wit h the Committee’s longer -run inflation objective.
 A few  participants stressed that the Committee should be more explicit about the need to achieve its inflation goal on a sustained basis.
 Several  participants suggested that inflation modestly excee ding 2 percent for a period would be consistent with the achievement of the Committee’s longer -run inflation objective and that such mild overshooting might underscore the symmetry of that objective.
" With regard to the Committee’s maximum employment objec tive, a few  participants observed that the actual level of employment might still be below maximum employment and that maintaining the present monetary policy stance would allow the economy to achieve that maximum level."
" Participants discussed the open market operations that the Federal Reserve had undertaken  since September  to implement monetary policy, as well as forthcoming operational measures."
" Beyond that point, regular open market operations would be required over time in order to accommodate the trend growth in the Federal Reserve’s liabilities and maintain an ample level of reserves."
 They remarked that the details of the  Committee’s plans would be adjusted as appropriate to support effective implementation of monetary policy.
 Participants noted that it would be important to continue to communicate to the public that open market operations now and in the period ahead were technical operations aimed at achieving and maintaining ample reserves and that any adjustments to those operations were not intended to represent a change in the stance of monetary policy.
 A couple  of these participants cited the potential for such a facility to reduce the banking system’s demand for reserves over the longer term.
" _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of January 28–29, 2020Page 17Committee Policy Action  In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, members noted that information received since the FOMC met in December indicated that the labor market remained strong and that economic activity had been rising at a moderate rate."
" Job gains had be en solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate had remained low."
" On a 12 -month basis, overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy were running below 2 percent."
 Market -based measures of inflation compensation remained low; survey-based measures of longer -term inflation expectations were little changed.
" Members judged that the current stance of monetary policy was appropriate to support sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation returning to the Committee’s symme tric 2 percent objective."
" Members also agreed that, in determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee would assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employ ment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective."
" And they concurred that this assessment would take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
" With regard to the postmeeting statement, members agreed that incoming data warranted a change in the statement’s description of recent rises in household spending from “strong” to “moder ate.”  They also agreed to describe the current monetary policy stance as consistent with inflation “returning to,” rather than being “near,” their symmetric 2 percent longer -run objective."
" In commenting on this change in wording, a  few members noted that the new language would make the postmeeting statement more consistent with the Committee’s outlook or might usefully affirm the symmetry of the Committee’s inflation goal and indicate that policymakers were not satisfied with inflation outcomes that were persistently below 2 percent."
” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for  release at 2:00 p.m.:   “Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in December indicates that the labor market remains strong and that economic activity has been rising at a moderate rate.
" Job gains have been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low ."
" On a 12‑month basis, overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy are running below 2  percent ."
 Market -based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey -based measures of longer -term inflation expectations are little changed.
" Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability ."
" The Committee judges that the current stance of monetary policy is appropriate to support sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation returning to the Committee ’s symmetric 2  percent objective."
" The Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook, including global developments and muted inflation pressures, as it assesses the appropriate path of the target range for the federal funds rate."
" In determ ining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2  percent inflation objective."
" This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
" Consistent with the Committee ’s decision to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the Board of Governors voted unanimously to raise the interest rates on required and excess reserve balances to 1.60 percent ."
 Setting the interest rate paid on required and excess reserve balances 10  basis points above the bottom of the target range for the federal funds rate is intended to foster trading in the federal funds market at rates well within the FOMC’s target range.
