Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information reviewed at the March 19–20 meeting suggested that economic activity was expanding at a moderate rate in the first quarter of this year after the slowdown late last year.
" Privatesector employment increased at a fairly solid pa ce, on balance, and the unemployment rate, though still elevated, was slightly lower in February than in the fourth quarter of last year."
" Consumer price inflation, excluding some temporary fluctuations in energy prices, was subdued, while measures of longerrun inflation expectations remained stable."
"Private nonfarm employment increased at a modest rate in January but expanded more briskly in February, while government employment continued to decrease."
" The unemployment rate was 7.7 percent in February, slightly less than its fourth -quarter average; the labor force participation rate was also a bit below its fourthquarter average."
" The rate of longduration unemployment and the share of workers employed part time for economic reasons were little changed, on net, and both measures remained high."
 Initial claims for unemployment insurance trended do wn somewhat over the intermeeting period.
" The rate of privatesector hiring, along with indicators of job openings and firms’ hiring plans, were generally subdued and were consistent with continued moderate increases in employment in the coming months."
The U.S. international trade deficit narrowed in December but widened in January.
 Nearterm inflation expectations from the Michigan survey were unchanged in February and early March; longerterm inflation expectations in the survey were also little changed and remained within the narrow range that they have occupied for some time.
"Measures of labor compensation indicated that gains in nominal wages remained relatively slow, only slightly above the rate of price inflation."
" Compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector rose modestly over 2012, and, with small increases in productivity, unit labor costs also advanced only modestly."
 Gains in the employment cost index were even slower than for the measure of compensation per hour last year.
Economic growth weakened in a number of the advanced foreign economies in the fourth quarter of 2012.
" In emerging market economies (EMEs), an increase in exports contributed to a pickup in the pace of economic growth in the fourth quarter, including for China."
 Morerecent indicators suggest that economic activity in China has slowed some.
" Inflation remained generally contained in both advanced foreign economies and EMEs. Staff Review of the Financial Situation Generally favorable U.S. economic data releases, along with communications from Federal Reserve policymakers regarding the outlook for the economy and monetary policy, appeared to contribute to improved sentiment in domestic financial markets over the intermeeting period despite some renewed concerns about economic and financial conditions in Europe."
"  The expected path for the federal funds rate implied by market quotes moved down over the intermeeting period, likely reflecting policymakers’ communications that reinforced market expectations of continued monetary policy accommodation."
 Measures of inflation compensation derived from nominal and inflationprotected Treasury securities edged down over the period.
" Nonrevolving credit continued to increase at a solid pace because of growth in student and auto loans, while revolving credit was roughly flat."
"Driven largely by continued growth in C&I loans, total bank credit expanded in January and February at roughly its fourthquarter pace."
" In addition, marketbased measures of expected overnight interest rates also declined in those countries, and the dollar appreciated against the euro, sterling, and the Canadian dollar."
" Some EME Page 4Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________  central banks cut interest rates, citing concerns about economic growth."
"The staff also reported on potential risks to financial stability, including those associated with the current low interest rate environment."
" Low interest rates likely have supported gains in asset prices and encouraged the flow of credit to households and businesses, but these changes to date do not appear to have been accompanied by significant financial imbalances ."
"Staff Economic Outlook In the economic forecast prepared by the staff for the March FOMC meeting, real GDP growth was revised down somewhat in the near term, largely reflecting the federal spending sequestration that went into effect on March 1 and the resulting drag from reduced government purchases."
" The staff’s mediumterm forecast for real GDP growth was little changed, on balance, as the effects of somewhat more fiscal policy restraint and a higher assumed path for the foreign exchange value of the dollar were essentially offset by a brighter outlook for domestic energy production and a higher projection for household wealth, which reflected upward revisions to the projected paths for both equity prices and home prices."
" On balance, with fiscal policy expected to be tighter in 2013 than in 2012,  the staff expected that increases in real GDP this year would only modestly exceed the growth rate of potential output."
" Fiscal policy restraint on economic gr owth was assumed to ease over time, and real GDP was projected to accelerate gradually in 2014 and 2015, su pported by increases in consumer and business sentiment, further improvements in credit availability and financial conditions, and accommodative monetary policy."
" The expansion in economic activity was anticipated to slowly reduce the slack in labor and product markets over the projection period, and progress in reducing the unemployment rate was expected to be gradual."
The staff’s forecast for inflation was little changed from the projection prepared for the January FOMC meeting.
" With crude oil prices anticipated to trend down slowly from their current levels, longrun inflation expectations assumed to rema in stable, and significant resource slack persisting over the forecast period, the staff continued to project that inflation would be subdued through 2015."
The staff viewed the uncertainty around its forecast for economic activity as similar to the average level over the past 20 years.
" The staff saw the uncertainty around its projection for inflation as about average, and it viewed the risks to the infl ation outlook as roughly balanced."
"Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and Economic Outlook In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, meeting participants—the 7 members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks, all of whom participate in the deliberations of the FOMC—submitted their assessments of real output growth, the unemployment rate, inflation, and the target federal funds rate for each year from 2013 through 2015 and over the longer run, under each participant’s judgment of appropriate monetary policy."
" The longerrun projections represent ea ch participant’s assessment of the rate to which each va riable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy."
" Participants judged that the economy had returned to moderate growth following a pause late last year, and a few noted that th e downside risks may have diminished."
" Conditions in labor markets had shown signs of improvement, although the unemployment rate remained elevated."
 Accommodative monetary policy was likely providing important support to these developments.
 Participants generally anticipated that growth would proceed at a moderate pace and that the unemployment rate would decline gradually toward levels consistent with the Committee’s mandate.
" Inflation had been running below the Committee’s 2 percent objective for some time, and nearly all of the participants anticipated that it would run at or be low 2 percent over the medium term."
" Several participants stated that the moderate acceleration in spending might in part reflect pentup demand following years of deleveraging and was importantly supported by the stance of monetary policy, which has reduced the cost of financing purchases and improved credit availability to some degree."
" A couple of other participants thought that overall consumer spending was likely still held back, at least in part, by ongoing concerns about future income and employment prospects."
" One participant pointed to ongoing changes in a range of factors—including demographics, credit conditions, business models, and consumer preferences—that were likely shifting both supply and demand in the housing sector and concluded that the outlook for the sector was quite uncertain and potentially subject to rapid changes."
" Firms reported increased planning for capital expenditures, supported by low interest rates and substantial cash holdings."
" Investment spending on productivityenhancing technology was strong, as was pipeline construction in the energy sector."
Most participants remarked on the federal spending sequester and its potential ef fects on the economy; they judged that recent tax and spending changes were already restraining aggregate demand or would do so over the course of the year.
Recent readings on private employment and the unemployment rate indicated some improvement in labor market conditions.
" Nonetheless, participants generally saw the unemployment rate as still elevated and were not yet confident that the recent progress toward the Committee’s employment objective would be sustained."
" One participant cited research indicating that longterm unemployment, which is currently especially high, could lead to persistently lower income and wealth for those affected, even after they found jobs."
" This caution appeared to have resulted in jobs remaining vacant for substantially longer th an would normally be the case, given the unemployment rate."
  Recent price developments were consistent with subdued inflation pressures and inflation remaining at or below the Committee’s 2 percent objective over the medium run.
" Participants saw little nearterm inflationary pressure, with a few noting that the appreciation of the dollar was holding down import costs or that the Page 6Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________  recent increases in gasoline prices did not appear to have passed through more broadly to prices of other goods."
" Pointing to inflation that had been running below their objective for some time, some participants saw downside risks to inflation, especially if economic activity did not pick up as projected."
" But a few participants noted that the risk remained that inflationary pressures could rise as the expansion continued, especially if monetary policy re mained highly accommodative for too long."
" Participants discussed their assessments of risks to financial stability, particularly  in light of the Committee’s highly accommodative stance of monetary policy."
" Many participants noted that in the current lowinterest rate environment, investors in some financial markets were taking on additional risk—either credit risk or interest rate risk—in an effort to boost returns."
" Meeting participants generally agreed that there was an ongoing need to evaluate the possible interactions between monetary policy decisions and financial stability, with some noting that adverse shocks to financial stability can affect progress toward the Committee’s dual mandate."
" Pointing to academic and Federal Reserve staff research, most participants sa w asset purchases as having a meaningful effect in easing financial conditions and so supporting economic growth."
" Other participants, however, saw little evidence that the efficacy of asset purchases had declined over time, and a couple of these suggested that the effectiveness of purchases might even have increased more recently, as the easing of credit constraints allowed more borrowers to take advantage of lower interest rates."
 One participant emphasized the role of recent asset purchases in keeping inflation from declining fu rther below the Committee’s longerrun goal.
" It was noted that, in addition to the standard channels through which monetary policy affects the economy, asset purchases could help signal the Committee’s commitment to accommodative monetary policy, thereby making the forward guidance about the federal funds rate more effective."
" Moreover, to the extent that asset purchases push down longerterm interest rates, they potentially expose financial markets to a rapid rise in those rates in the future, which could impose significant losses on some investors and intermediaries."
" Several participants suggested that enhanced superv ision could serve to limit, at least to some extent, the increased risktaking associated with a lengthy period of low longterm interest rates, and that effective policy communication or balance sheet management by the Committee could reduce the probability of excessively rapid increases in longerterm rates."
 Several participants stated that such risks should not inhibit the Committee from pursuing its mandated objectives for inflation and employment.
 A few participants raised the possibility of an undesirable rise in inflation.
" However, others expressed confidence in the Committee’s exit  tools and its resolve to keep inflation near its longerrun goal."
Committee Policy Action  Committee members saw the information received over the intermeeting period as suggesting that moderate economic growth had resumed following a pause late last year.
" Labor market conditions had shown signs of improvement, but the unemployment rate remained elevated."
" The Committee expected that, with appropriate monetary policy accommodation, Page 8Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________  economic growth would proceed at a moderate pace and result in a gradual decline in the unemployment rate toward levels that the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate."
" Members generally continued to anticipate that, with longerterm inflation expectations stable and slack in resource utilization remaining, inflation over the medium term would likely run at or below the Committee’s 2 percent objective."
"In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members saw the economic outlook as little changed since the previous meeting, and, consequently, all but one member judged that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy was warranted in order to foster a stronger economic recovery in a context of price stability."
" The Committee also retained its forward guidance about the federal funds rate, including the thresholds on the unemployment and inflation rates."
" One member dissented from the Committee’s policy decision, expressing concern that the continued high level of monetary accommodation increased the risks of future economic and financial imbalances and, over time, could cause an increase in inflation expectations."
 Members stressed that any changes to the purchase program should be conditional on continuing assessments both of labor market and inflation developments and of the efficacy and costs of asset purchases.
"   At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct  the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: “Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster maximum employment and price stability."
 The System Open Market Account Manager and the Secretary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the System’s balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the Committee’s objectives of maximum employment and price stability.” The vote encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p.m.: “Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in January suggests a return to moderate economic growth following a pause late last year.
 Labor market conditions have shown signs of improvement in recent months but the unemployment rate remains elevated.
" Inflation has been running somewhat below the Committee’s longerrun objective, apart from temporary variations that largely reflect fluctuations in energy prices."
 Longerterm inflation expectations have remained stable.
"Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
" The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic growth will proceed at a moderate pace and the unemployment rate will grad ually decline toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate."
 The Committee also anticipates that inflation over the medium term likely will run at or below its 2 percent objective.
"To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate, the Committee decided to continue purchasing additional agency mortgagebacked securities at a pace of $40 billion per month and longerterm Treasury securities at a pace of $45 billion per month."
" Taken together, these actions should maintain downward pressure on longerterm interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative."
"To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee expects that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens."
" In particular, the Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and currently anticipates that this exceptionally low ra nge for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6½ percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee’s 2 percent longerrun goal, and longerterm inflation expectations continue to be well anchored."
" In determining how long to maintain a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy, the Committee will also consider other information, including additional measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments."
" When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longerrun goals of maximum employment and inflation of  2 percent.” Voting for this action:   Ben Bernanke, William C."
Ms. George dissented because she continued to view monetary policy as too accommodative and therefore as posing risks to the achievement of the Committee’s economic objectives in the long run.
" In particular, the current stance of policy could lead to financial imbalances, a mispricing of risk, and, over time, higher longterm inflation expectations."
"English Secretary  Minutes of the Meeting of March 19–20, 2013Page 11_____________________________________________________________________________________________ Summary of Economic ProjectionsIn conjunction with the March 19–20, 2013, Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, meeting participants—the 7 members of the Board of Governors and the 12 presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks, all of whom participate in the deliberations of the FOMC—submitted their assessments of real output growth, the unemployment rate, inflation, and the target federal funds rate for each year from 2013 through 2015 and over the l onger run."
 Each participant’s assessment was based on information available at the time of the meeting plus his or her judgment of appropriate monetary policy and assumptions about the factors likely to affect economic outcomes.
" The    longerrun projections represent each participant’s judgment of the value to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy."
 “Appropriate monetary policy” is defined as the future path of policy that each participant deems most likely to foster outcomes for economic activity and inflation that best satisfy his or her individual interpretation of the Federal Reserve’s objectives of maximum employment and stable prices.
"Overall, the assessments su bmitted in March indicated that FOMC participants projected that, under appropriate monetary policy, the pace of economic recovery would gradually pick up over the 2013–15 period and inflation would remain subdue d (table 1 and figure 1)."
 Participants anticipated that the growth rate of real gross domestic product (G DP) would increase somewhat over the forecast period to a pace that generally exceeded their estimates of the longerrun sustainable rate of growth.
 Participants expected the unemployment rate to decline gradually  through 2015.
" Nearly all participants projected that inflation, as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), would remain somewhat below the longerrun goal in 2013 and then rise toward    2 percent over the forecast period."
"As shown in figure 2, most participants judged that highly accommodative monetary policy was likely to be warranted over the next few years to support stable prices and continued progress toward maximum employment."
  Many participants continued to judge the uncertainty associated with the outlook for real activity and the unemployment rate to be unusually high compared with the norm of the past 20 years.
2.3 to 3.0 3.0 to 3.5 3.0 to 3.7 2.3 to 2.5 2.0 to 3.2 2.8 to 4.0 2.5 to 4.2 2.2 to 3.0 Unemployment rate .

" PCE infl ation and core PCE inflation are the percentage rates of change in, respectively, the price index for personal consumption expenditur es (PCE) and the price index for PCE excluding food and energy."
 Projections for the unemployment rate are for the average civilian unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of the yea r indicated.
 Each participant’ s projections are based on his or  her assessment of appropriate monetary policy.
 Longerrun projections represent each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to  the economy.
 Longerrun projections for core PCE inflation are not collected.

" A majority of participants indicated that the uncertainty surrounding their projections for PCE inflation was broadly similar to historical norms, and nearly all considered the risks to inflation to be either broadly balanced or weighted to the downside."
"The Outlook for Economic Activity Participants projected that, conditional on their individual assumptions about appropriate monetary policy, the economy would grow at a somewhat faster pace in 2013 than it had in 2012."
" Th ey also generally judged that growth would strengthen further in 2014 and 2015, in most cases to a rate above what participants saw as the longerrun rate of output growth."
" Most participants noted that the high degree of monetary policy accommodation assumed in their projections would help promote the economic recovery over the forecast period and expected that continued improvement in the housing sector would add more broadly to private demand; however, they also judged that increased fiscal restraint in the United Stat es would hold back the pace of economic expansion, especially in 2013, and pointed to the situation in Europe as an ongoing downside risk."
" When participants compared their own March forecast with the one they made in December, many mentioned that   strongerthan-anticipated incoming data on private economic activity had nearly offset the effects of  greaterthan-expected fiscal restraint likely to be put in place this year."
"  Participants anticipated a gradual decline in the unemployment rate over the forecast period; even so, they generally thought that the unemployment rate at the end of 2015 would remain we ll above their individual estimates of its longerrun normal level."
 The central tendencies of participants’ forecasts for the unemployment rate were 7.3 to 7.5 percent at the end of 2013 and 6.7 to 7.0 percent at the end of 2014.
" These projections are slightly lower than in December, with a few participants attributing their revisions to the more favorable data from the labor market or small changes in their estimated rate of potential output growth."
" The central tendency of participants’ estimates of the longerrun normal rate of unemployment that would prevail under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy was 5.2 to 6.0 percent, the same as in December."
" Most participants projected that the unemployment rate would converge to their estimates of its longerrun normal rate in five or six years, while some judged that less time would be needed."
"As shown in figures 3.A and 3.B, participants’ views regarding the likely outcomes for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate over the next three years and over the longer run remained  diverse, reflecting their individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy and its economic effects, the likely rate of improvement in the housing sector and do mestic spending more generally, the domestic implications of foreign economic developments, the extent of structural dislocations to the labor market and the economy’s productive potential, and a number of other factors."
" The dispersion of participants’ projections of real GDP growth was little changed relative to Decemb er, with a small reduction in the upper end of the distribution in all three years of the forecast period and a slight overall downward shift in 2014."
" The dispersion of estimates for the longerrun rate of output growth stayed fairly narrow, with all but four within the central tendency of 2.3 to 2.5 percent; two participants, however, dropped their estimates to below 2.2 percent."
" The range of participants’ estimates of the longerrun rate of unemployment, at 5.0 to 6.0 percent, was unchanged relative to December."
"The Outlook for Inflation Participants’ broad outlook for inflation under appropriate monetary policy suggested that both headline and core inflation would rema in subdued over the 2013–15 period, with nearly all participants judging that inflation would be equal to or below the FOMC’s longerrun objective of 2 percent in each year."
" Specifically, the central tendency of participants’ projections for overall inflation in 2013, as measur ed by the growth in the PCE price index, narrowed to  1.3 to 1.7 percent, while the central tendencies for 2014 and 2015 were unchanged at 1.5 to 2.0 percen t and 1.7 to 2.0 percent, respectively."
" The central tendency of the forecasts for core inflation in 2013 also na rrowed, to 1.5 to 1.6 percent, but, unlike overall inflation, edged up slightly in 2014 and 2015; nevertheless, the central tendencies remained near or below 2 percent in both years."

 Figures 3.C and 3.D provide information on the diversity of participants’ views about the outlook for inflation.
 The ranges of participants’ projections for overall inflation in 2013 and 2014 we re almost unchanged compared with the corresponding distributions for December.
" The ranges for core inflation were also little changed, but, in 2013, many of the projections shifted toward the lower end of the range."
" The distributions for core and overall inflation in 2015 remained concentrated near the Committee’s longerrun objective, and all participants continued to project that overall inflation would converge to the 2 percent goal over the longer run."
"Appropriate Monetary Policy As indicated in figure 2, mo st participants judged that exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate would remain appropriate for a couple more years."
All of the participants who judged that raising the federal funds rate target would first be appropriate in 2015 also projected that the unemployment rate would first decline below 6½ percent during that year and that inflation would remain near or below 2 percent.
" In addition, those participants, as well as the participant who saw liftoff in 2016 as appropriate, also projected that a sizable gap between the unemployment rate and the longerrun normal level of the unemployment rate would persist until 2015 or late r."
 The majority of the five participants who judged that policy firming should begin in 2013 or 2014 indicated that the Committee would need to act relatively soon in order to keep inflation near the FOMC’s longerrun objective of 2 percent and to prevent a rise in inflation expectations.
" Estimates of the longerrun target federal funds rate ranged from 3¼ to 4½ percent, reflecting the Committee’s inflation objective of 2 percent and participants’ individual judgments about the longerrun level of the real federal funds rate."
" Key factors informing participants’ views of the economic outlook and the appropriate setting for monetary policy included their judgments regarding labor market conditions that would be consistent with maximum employment, the extent to which employment Summary of Economic Projections of the Meeting of March 19–20, 2013                                                                                                                                                                               Page 7Figure 3.C.

" It was also noted that, because the appropriate stance of monetary policy is conditional on the path of real activity and inflation over time, assessments of the appropriate future path of the federal funds rate and the balance sheet could change if economic conditions were to evolve in an unexpected manner."
"Uncertainty and Risks A majority of the participants continued to judge that the levels of uncertainty about their projections for real GDP growth and unemployment remained higher than was the norm during the previous 20 years; however, the number of participants with this view was noticeably smaller than in December (figure 4).1  T h e  m a i n  factor cited as contributing  to the elevated uncertainty about economic outcomes was the challenge associated with forecasting the path of the U.S. economic recovery following a financial crisis and recession that differed markedly from recent historical experience."
" A majority of participants, somewhat more than in December, reported that they saw the risks to their forecasts of real GDP growth an d unemployment as broad1 Table 2 provides estimates of the forecast uncertainty for the change in real GDP, the unemployment rate, and total consumer price inflation over  the period from 1993 through 2012."
"ly balanced, with the remain der generally indicating that they saw the risks to their forecasts for real GDP growth as weighted to the downside and for unemployment as weighted to the upside."
Participants reported little change in their assessments of the level of uncertainty and the balance of risks around their forecasts for overall PCE inflation and core inflation.
" Thirteen part icipants judged the levels of uncertainty associated with their forecasts for those inflation measures to be broadly similar to, or lower than, historical norms; the same number assessed the risks to those projections to be broadly balanced."
 Several participants highlighted the likely role played by the Committee’s adoption of a 2 percent inflation goal or its commitment to maintaining accommodative monetary policy as contributing to the recent stability of longerterm inflation expectations.
" Four participants saw the risks to their inflation forecast as tilted to the downside, reflecting, for example, risks of disinflation that could arise from adverse shocks to the economy that policy would have limite d scope to offset in the current environment."
" Conversely, a couple of the participants saw the risks to inflation as weighted to the upside in light of the current highly accommodative stance of monetary policy and their concerns about the Committee’s ability to shift to a less accommodative policy stance when it beco mes appropriate to do so.Table 2."

" Thus, in setting the stance of monetary policy, participants consider no t only what appears to be the most likely economic outcome as embodied in their projections, but also the range of alternative possibilities, the likelihood of their occurring, and the potential costs to the economy should they occur."
"Table 2 summarizes the average historical accuracy of a range of forecasts, including those reported in past Monetary Policy Report s and those prepared by the Federal Reserve Board’s staff in advance of meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee."
" The corresponding 70 percent confidence intervals for overall inflation would be 1.1 to 2.9 percent in the current year, 1.0 to 3.0 percent in the second year, and 0.9 to      3.1 percent in the third year."
"As with real activity and inflation, the outlook for the future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable uncertainty."
 This uncertainty arises primarily because each participant’s assessment of the appropriate stance of monetary policy depends importantly on the evolution of real activity and inflation over time.
