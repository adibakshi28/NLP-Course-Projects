" Alongside the rise in commodities prices, measures of nearterm inflation compensation increased sharply across advanced economies."
" Overnight interest rates were steady throughout the period, but there were some signs of pressures in term funding markets."

" Market participants expected the interest on reserve balances rate and overnight reverse repurchase agreement ( ON RRP ) offering rate to be increased by 25 basis points at the current meeting, in line with their expected increase in the target  range, and anticipated that the chang es would fully pass through to market overnight interest rates."
"In their discussion, all participants agreed that elevated inflation and tight labor market conditions warranted commencement of balance sheet runoff  at a coming meeting , with a faster pace of decline in securities holdings than over the 2017 –19 period."
" In addition, participants generally noted that maintaining large holdings of Treasury bills is not necessary under the Federal Reserve’s amplereserves operating framework; in the previous scarcereserves regime, Treasury bill holdings were useful as a tool that could be used to drain reserves from the banking system w hen necessary to control shortterm interest rates."
"  With respect to the Federal Reserve’s agency MBS redemptions, participants generally noted that MBS principal prepayments would likely run under the proposed monthly cap in a range of plausible interest rate scenarios but that the cap could guard against o utsized reductions in the Federal Reserve’s agency MBS holdings in scenarios with especially high prepayments."
 Consumer price inflation through January —as measured by the 12 -month percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) —remained elevated.
Total nonfarm payroll employment grew strongly in January and February.
" The unemployment rate edged down, on net, from 3.9  percent in December to 3.8  percent in February."
" The unemployment rate for African Americans and for Hispanics declined over this period; however, both rates remained noticeably higher than the national average."
" The labor force participation rate increased  in February, as did the employment -topopula-tion ratio."
" Total PCE price inflation was 6.1  percent over the 12  months ending in January, and core PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in consumer energy prices and many consumer food prices,  was 5.2 percent over the same period."
" The trimmed mean measure of 12 -month PCE inflation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas was 3.5 percent in January, 1.8  percentage points higher than its year -earlier rate of increase."
" In February, the 12month change in the consumer price index (CPI) was 7.9 percent, while core CPI inflation was 6.4  percent over the same period."
" The staff’s common inflation expectations index, which combines information from many indicators of inflation expectations and inflation compensation, had largely leveled off over the fall and was close to its 2014 average."
" Housing demand remained strong, though activity in the residential housing sector continued to be restrained by shortages of construction materials, buildable lots, and other inputs."
 Available indicators suggested that growth in business fixed investment was picking up in the first quarter as growth in nonresidential structures investment turned positive.
 The U.S. international trade deficit widened at the end of last year to a record high and  surpassed that high at the beginning of this year.
" Inflation abroad continued to rise, driven by recovering global demand, rising retail energy and food prices, and ongoing  strains on global supply chains; the effects of the Russian invasion contributed to some of these inflationary pressures."
" Nominal Treasury yields and the expected path of policy rose during the intermeeting period, driven by economic data releases and FOMC communications that were viewed as implying a more rapid removal of monetary policy accommodation than previously expected."
 Investors interpreted incoming economic data and Federal Reserve communications as implying a more rapid removal of monetary policy accommodation than they had previously expected.
" Near -term inflation compensation implied by Treasury InflationProtected Securities rose sharply, reflecting the higher -thananticipated CPI releases and surging energy prices following the Russian invasion of Ukraine."
" Foreign asset prices were highly volatile over the intermeeting period in response to geopolitical developments, central bank communications, and rising inflation concerns."
" Despite downward pressure from the geopolitical events, AFE sovereign yields increased notably, on net, on higher -thanex-pected inflation readings and central bank communications that were perceived as less accommodative than expected."
" Even so, financial conditions among EMEs —including fund flows and the relative strength of local currencies outside of Europe —were resilient compared with past episodes Page 6Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ of global turbulence, reflecting in part higher commodity prices and monetary policy tightening by EME central banks."
" Nonfinancial gross corporate bond issuance slowed noticeably in January and February, reflecting  lower demand for credit due to rising borrowing costs and elevated issuance over the past two years."
" Spreads in the corporate bond, municipal bond, and CMBS markets generally rose to somewhat above their prepandemic levels, reflecting heightened geopolitical risks,  uncertainty about the outlook for monetary policy, and elevated financial market volatility."
" Interest rates on Minutes of the Meeting of March 15–16, 2022Page 7_____________________________________________________________________________________________ new credit cards rose to roughly their pre -pandemic levels, while rates on auto loans also rose slightly but remained significantly below prepandemic levels."
" Staff Economic Outlook  The near -term projection for U.S. economic activity prepared by the staff for the March FOMC meeting was weaker than in January, reflecting the anticipated economic effects of the conflict in Ukraine and financial conditions that were expected to be less supportive than previously assumed."
" For 2022 as a whole,  real GDP growth was projected to step down markedly from its rapid 2021 pace before picking up slightly in 2023 as the continued resolution of supply constraints provided a small boost to growth."
 Real GDP growth was expected to slow further in 2024 to a pace that was in line with potential growth.
 The staff’s near -term projection for PCE pr ice inflation was revised up considerably relative to January.
" The upward revision reflected the staff’s reaction to the persistently high and broad -based levels of domestic inflation, import price inflation, and wage growth that had been observed, as well as the staff’s expectation that the upward pressure on inflation from supply and demand imbalances would last longer than previously assumed."
" In addition, total PCE price inflation was further revised up to reflect higher expected paths for consumer energy and food prices."
" All told, total PCE price inflation was projected to be 4  percent in 2022."
" PCE price inflation was then expected to slow to 2.3  percent in 2023 and to 2.1 percent in 2024 as food, energy, and import price inflation moved lower and as  supply and demand imbalances were resolved."
 The staff continued to judge that the risks to the baseline projection for real activity were skewed to the downside and that the risks to the inflation projection were skewed to the upside.
" The COVID -19 pandem ic remained a source of downside risk to activity, while the possibility of more severe and more persistent supply issues was viewed as posing an additional downside risk to activity and an upside risk to inflation."
" The Russian invasion of Ukraine was perceived as adding to the uncertainty around the outlook for economic activity and inflation, as the conflict carried the risk of further exacerbating supply chain disruptions and of putting additional upward pressure on inflation by boosting the prices for energy, food, and other key commodities."
" Finally, the possibility that continued high inflation would cause longer -term inflation expectations to become unanchored was seen as another upside risk to the inflation projection."
" Participants’ Views on Current  Conditions and the Economic Outlook  In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2022 through 2024 and over the longer run based on their individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy, including the path of the federal funds rate."
" The longer -run projections represented each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy."
" In their discussion of current economic conditions,  participants noted that indicators of economic activity and employment had continued to strengthen."
" Job gains had been strong in recent months, and the unemployment rate had declined substantially."
" Inflation remained elevated, reflecting continued suppl y and demand imbalances, higher energy prices, and broader price pressures."
" With appropriate firming in the stance of monetary policy, participants expected inflation to return to the Committee’s 2 percent objective over time and the labor market to remain strong."
" They judged that the implications of the war for the U.S. economy were highly uncertain, but in the near  term, the invasion and related events were likely to create significant additional upward pressure on inflation and could weigh on economic activity."
"   With regard to  the economic outlook, participants noted that real GDP growth had slowed from its rapid pace in the fourth quarter of 2021, largely reflecting weaker inventory investment, but consumption and business investment continued to rise solidly ."
" Relative to their December forecasts, p articipants had revised down their projections for real GDP growth this year, reflecting  factors such as a slowdown in inventory investment from its strong pace late last year, reduced fiscal and monetary policy accommodation, and the Russian inv asion of Ukraine, which had led  to higher  prices of energy and other commodities , increased uncert ainty,  and weighed  on broader financial Page 8Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ conditions and consumer sentiment."
"  Even so, participants  judged  that economic fundamentals remained solid and that they expected abovetrend  growth to continue, sustaining a strong labor market."
  Participants commented that demand for labor continued to substantially exceed available supply across many parts of the economy and that their business contacts continued to report difficulties in hiring and retaining workers.
 Employment growth remained strong  through the Omicron wave.
 A couple of participants highlighted that the annual  benchmark revision to the establishment survey employment data revealed stronger employment growth in the second half of 2021 than was initially reported.
" The unemployment rate had fallen to a postpandemic low, and quits and job openings were at all -time highs."
" Although payroll employment remained below its prepandemic level, the shortfall was concentrated in a few sectors and reflected a shortage of workers rather  than insufficient demand for labor."
"  Participants remarked that recent inflation readings continued to significantly exceed the Committee’s longer -run goal and noted that developments associated with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine , including the related surge in energy prices , will  add to near -term inflation pressures."
" Some participants noted that elevated  inflation had continued to broaden from goods in to services, especial ly rents, and into sectors that had not yet experienced large price increases, such as education, apparel, and health care."
" A few participants  also noted that the number of spending categories  experiencing inflation rates above 4 percent had continued to rise, or that the trimmed mean inflation measure from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas had risen to its high est level since the early 1980s."
 Many participants indicated that their business contacts continued to report substantial increases in wages and input prices that were being passed through into higher prices to their customers without any significant decrease in demand.
" Participants commented on a few factors that might lead the high inflation readings to persist, including strong aggregate demand, significant increases in energy and commodity prices, and supply chain disruptions that were likely to require a lengthy period to resolve."
" In addition, some participants noted that recent higher inflation could affect future inflation dynamics."
" For example, a few  participants commented that persistently high inflation readings might lead businesses, when setting prices, to be more attentive to aggregate inflation or more willing to raise prices."
" In addition, a couple of other participants noted that some household survey data suggested that nearterm consumer inflation expectations have become more sensitive to actual inflation readings since the beginning of the pandemic."
 A few participants commented that both surveyand marketbased measures of shortterm inflation expectations were at historically high levels.
" Several other participants noted that longer -term meas ures of inflation expectations from households, professional forecasters, and market participants still appeared to remain well anchored, which —together with appropriate monetary policy  and an eventual easing of supply constraints —would support a return of  inflation over time to levels consistent with the Committee’s longer -run goal."
"  Participants  agreed that developments surrounding the Russian invasion of Ukraine, including the resulting sanctions , were adding to inflation pressures and  posing upside risks to the inflation outlook."
" Participants commented that, by leading to higher energy and food prices, weighing  on consumer sentiment, and contributing to tighter financial conditions, the invasion also negatively affected  the growth outlook ."
" A few participants highlighted additional downside risks to growth associated with the war, such as the risk that a  more protracted conflict than the public currently expects could lead to much tighter global financial conditions or other disruptions ."
" A couple of participants commented that the increased uncertainty might lead businesses and consumers to reduce spendi ng, though their business contacts currently were not seeing signs of such shifts or expect ing a significant pullback in demand ."
" Minutes of the Meeting of March 15–16, 2022Page 9_____________________________________________________________________________________________ Several participants judged that the upside risk to inflation associated with the war appeared more significant than the downs ide risk to growth, as inflation was already high, the United States had a relatively low level of financial and trade exposure to Russia , and the U.S. economy was well positioned to absorb additional adverse demand shocks."
"  In their discussion of risks to the outlook, participants agreed that uncertainty regarding the path of inflation was elevated and that risks to inflation were weighted to the upside."
" Participants cited several such risks, including ongoing supply bottlen ecks and rising energy and commodity prices, both of which w ere exacerbated by the Russian inv asion; recent COVIDrelated lockdowns in China that had the potential to further disrupt supply chains ; and the possibility that longer -run inflation expectations  might become unanchored."
" In their consideration of the appropriate stance of monetary policy, all participants concurred that the U.S. economy was very strong, with an extremely tight labor market, and that inflation was high and well above the Committee’s 2 percent inflation objective."
" Participants also agreed that reducing the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet would play an important role in firmin g the stance of monetary policy and that they expected it would be appropriate to begin  this process at a coming meeting, possibly as soon as in May."
" Participants judged that the firming of monetary policy, alongside an eventual waning of supply– demand imbalances, would help to keep longer -term inflation expectations anchored and bring inflation down over time to levels consistent with the Committee’s 2 percent longer -run goal while sustaining a strong labor market."
"  Many participants noted that—with inflation well above the Committee’s objective, inflationary risks to the upside, and the federal funds rate well below participants’ estimates of  its longer -run level—they would  have preferred a 50  basis  point increase in the target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting."
" Many participants noted that one or more 50 basis point increases in the target range could be appropriate at future meeting s, particularly if inflation pressures remained elevated or intensified."
"  A number of  participants noted that the Committee’s previous communications had already contributed to a tightening of financial conditions , as evident in the notable increase in longer -term interest rates over recent months."
 Participants judged that it would be appropriate to move the stance of monetary policy toward a neutral posture expeditiously .
" A few participants judged  that, at the current juncture, a significant risk facing the Committee was that elevated inflation and inflation expectations could become entrenched if the public began to question the Committee’s resolve  to adjust the stance of policy as  appropriate to achieve the Committee’s 2 percent long errun objective for inflation."
  These participants suggested that expediting the removal of policy accommodation would reduce this  risk while also leaving the Committee well positioned to adjust the stance of policy if geopolitical and other developments led to a more rapid dissipation of demand pressures than expected.
" As always, the Committee would need to be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy in response to the evolving economic outlook and the risks to the outlook."
" Against this backdrop, all participants judged that risk management would  be important in deciding upon the appropriate stance of monetary policy, and that  policy also would need to be nimble in responding to incoming data and the evolving outlook."
" In particular, all participants underscored the need to remain attentive Page 10Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ to the risks of further upward pressure on inflation and longer -run inflation expectations."
" Committe e Policy Action  In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that indicators of economic activity and employment had continued to strengthen."

" The implications for the U.S. economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and relat ed events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity."
 The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2  percent over the longer run.
" With appropriate firming in the stance of monetary policy, the Committee expects inflation to return to its 2  percent objective and the labor market to remain strong."

 President Bullard preferred at this meeting to raise the target range for the federal funds rate by 0.5  percentage point to ½ to ¾  percent in light of elevated inflation pressures.
" To support the Commi ttee’s decision to raise the target range for the federal funds rate, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to raise the interest rate paid on reserve balances to 0.40 percent, effective March  17, 2022."
" (Secretary’s note:  Subsequently, the Federal Reserve Banks of New York and Dallas were informed of  the Secretary of the Board’s approval of their establishment of a primary credit rate of 0.50  percent, effective March  17, 2022.)  The second vote of the Board also encompassed approval of the establishment of the interest rates for secondary and seasonal credit under the existing formulas for computing such rates."
