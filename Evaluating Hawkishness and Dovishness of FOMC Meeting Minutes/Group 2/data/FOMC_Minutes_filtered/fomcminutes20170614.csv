" Meanwhile, inflation compensation edged lower."
 ○ The Committee also anti cipates that the caps will remain in place once they reach their respective maximums so that the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings will continue to decline in a gradual and predictable manner until the Committee judges that the Federal Reserve is holding no more securities than necessary to implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively.
" The Committee currently anticipates reducing the quantity of reserve balances, over time, to a level appreciably below that seen in recent years but larger than before the financial crisis; the level will reflect the banking system’s demand for reserve balances and the Committee’s decisions about how to implement monetary policy most efficiently and effectively in the future."
 The Committee expects to learn more about the underlying demand for reserves during the process of balance sheet normalization.
 • The Committee affirms that changing the targ et range for the federal funds rate is its primary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy.
" Moreover, the Committee would be prepared to use its full range of tools, including altering the size and composition of its balance sheet, if future economic conditions were to warrant a more accommodative monetary policy than can be achieved solely by reducing the federal funds rate."
" The 12month change in overall consumer prices, as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), slowed a bit further in April; total consumer price inflation and core inflation, which excludes consumer food and energy prices, were both running somewhat below 2 percent."
 Survey -based measures of longer -run inflation expectations were little changed on balance.
" Total nonfarm payroll employment expanded  further  in April and May, and the average pace of job gains over the first five months of the year was solid."
 The unemployment rate moved down to 4.3 percent in May; the unemployment rates for Afric an Americans and for Hispanics stepped down but remained above the unemployment rates for Asians and for whites.
 The four -week moving average of initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits remained at a very low level through early June.
" In addition, recent readings on key factors that influence consumer spending pointed to further solid growth in total real PCE in the near term, including continued gains in employment, real disposable personal income, and households’ net worth."
" The first -quarter strength may have reflected housing activity shifting earlier in response  to unseasonably warm weather last quarter, to an anticipation of higher future interest rates, or  to both."
" The nominal U.S. international trade deficit widened slightly in Ma rch, with a small decline in exports and a small increase in imports."
" In April, the nominal trade deficit widened , as imports picked up while exports declined slightly."
 Net exports were estimated to have made a small posi tive contribution to real GDP growth in the first quarter.
" However, the April trade data suggested that net exports might be a slight drag on real GDP growth in the second quarter."
 Core PCE price inflation was 1½ percent over those same 12 months.
" Over the 12 months ending in May, the consumer price index (CPI) rose a little less than 2 percent, while core CPI inflation was 1¾ percent."
" The median of inflation expectations over the next 5 to 10 years from the Michigan survey was unchanged in May, and the median expectation for PCE price inflation over the next 10 years from the Survey of Professional Forecasters also held stea dy in the second quarter."
" Likewise, the medians of longer -run inflation expectations from the Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants were essentially unchanged in June."
" In contrast, economic growth in the United Kingdom slowed sharply."
 Recent indicators suggested that real GDP growth in most foreign economies remai ned solid in the second quarter.
" Headline inflation across the advanced foreign economies (AFEs) generally appeared to moderate from the pace registered over the first quarter, as the effects of earlier increases in energy prices started to fade; core inf lation continued to be subdued in many AFEs.  Among the EMEs, inflation in China rose while inflation in Latin America fell."
" In Mexico, the effects of fuel price hikes in January and the pass -through from earlier currency depreciation to prices started to  wane, but inflation remained above the central bank’s target."
" However, investors also reportedly viewed the Committee’s planning as mitigating the risk that the process of reducing the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet would lead to outsized movements in interest rates or have adverse effects on market functioning."
" Immediately following the May FOMC meeting, nomina l Treasury yields rose at short  and intermedia te maturities , reportedly reflecting the response of investors to a passage in the postmeeting statement indicating the Committee’s view  that the slowing in real GDP growth during the first quarter was likely to be transitory."
" Later in the intermeeting period, yields declined in reaction to the release of weaker -thanexpected April CPI data and the somewhat disappointing May employment report."
" Both 5 -year and  5to-10year-forward TIPS -based inflation compensation declined, in part reflecting the below -expectations inflation data."
" Commercial and industrial loans outstanding increased in April and May after being weak in the first quarter, al though the growth of these loans remained well below the pace seen a year ago."
" However, recent CRE loan  growth was a bit slower than that during the first quarter, in part reflecting a slowdown in lending for both construction and multifamily units."
" Despite the higher level of mortgage rates, growth in mortgage lending for home purchases remained near the upper end  of its recent range during the first quarter."
 Delinquency rates on residential mortgage loans continued to edge down amid robust house price growth and still -tight lending standards for households with low credit scores and hard -todocument incomes.
 Growth in auto loans remained solid through the first quarter.
" Staff Economic Outlook  In the U.S. economic projection prepared by the staff for the June FOMC meeting, real GDP growth was forecast to step up to a solid pace in the second quarter following its weak reading in the first quarter, primarily reflecting faster real PCE growth."
" On  balance, the incoming data on aggregate spending were a little stronger than the staff had expected, and the forecast of real GDP growth for the current year was a bit higher than in the previous projection."
" Beyond this year, the projection for real GDP growth was essentially unchanged."
 The unemployment rate was projected to decline gradually over the next couple of years and to continue running below the staff’s estimate of its longer -run natural rate over this period.
" The staff’s forecast for consu mer price inflation, as measured by the change in the PCE price index, was revised down slightly for 2017 because of the weaker -thanexpected incoming data for inflation."
" Inflation was still expected to be somewhat higher this year than last year, largely reflecting an upturn in the prices for food and nonenergy imports."
" The staff projected that inflation would increase further in the nex t couple of years, and that it would be close to the Committee’s longer -run objective in 2018 and at 2 percent in 2019."
" The staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as similar to the  average of the past 20 years."
 The staff saw the risks to the forecasts for real GDP and the unemployment rate as balanced; the staff’s assessment was that the downside risks associated with monetary policy not being well  positioned to respond to adverse shocks had diminished since its previous forecast.
 The risks to the projection for inflation also were seen as roughly balanced.
 The downside risks from the possibility that longer -term inflation expectations may have ed ged down or that the dollar could appreciate substantially were seen as essentially counterbalanced by the upside risk that inflation could increase more than expected in an economy that was projected to continue operating above its longer -run potential.
" The office of the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond was idents submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real output growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2017 through 2019 and over the longer run, based on their individual assessments of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate.4  The longer -run projections represented each participant’s ass essment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy.5  These projections and policy assessments are described in the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), which is an addendum to these minutes."
" In their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants agreed that the information received over the intermeeting period indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising moderately, on average, so far this year."
" Job gains had moderated since the beginning of the year but had remained solid, on average, and the unemployment rate had declined."
" Inflation measured on a 12 -month basis had declined recently and, like the measure excluding food and energy prices, had been running somewhat below 2 percent."
 Marketbased measures of inflation compensation remained low; survey -based measures of longer -term inflation expectations were little changed on balance.
" Participants generally saw the incoming information on spending and labor market indicators as consistent, overall, with their expectations and indicated that their views of the outlook for economic growth and the labor market had changed only slightly since the May FOMC meeting."
" As anticipated, growth in consumer spending seemed to have bounced back from a weak first quarter, and participants continued to expect that, with further gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity would expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions would strengthen somewhat further."
" In light of surprisingly low recent readings on inflation, participants expected that inflation on a  12month basis would remain somewhat below 2 percent in the near term."
"  5 One participant did not submit longer -run projections for real output growth, the unemployment rate, or the federal funds rate."
" Minutes of the Meeting of June 13–14, 2017Page 7_____________________________________________________________________________________________   inflation would stabilize around the Committee’s 2 percent objective over the medium term."
 Growth in consumer spending appeared to be rebounding after slowing in the first quarter of this year.
" Participants generally continued to expect that ongoing job gains, rising household income and wealth, and improved household balance sheets would support moderate growth in household spending over the medium term."
 The unemployment rate fell from 4.5  percent in March to 4.3 percent in May and was below levels that participants judged likely to be normal over the longer run.
 A few  participants interpreted this slowing in payroll growth as an expected development that reflected a tight labor market.
" Other labor market indicators, such as the number of job openings and broader measures of unemployment, were also seen as consistent with labor market conditions having strengthened  in recent months."
 A couple of participants saw the restrained increases in labor compensation as consistent with the low productivity growth and moderate inflation experience d in recent years.
" In light of the recent behavior of labor compensation and consumer prices as well as demographic trends, a number of participants lowered their estimate of the longer -run normal level of the unemployment rate."
 Recent readings on headline and core PCE price inflation had come in lower than participants had expected.
" On a 12 -month basis, headline PCE price inflation was running somewhat below the Committee’s 2  percent objective in April, partly because of factors  that appeared to be transitory."
" Core PCE price inflation—which historically has been a more useful predictor of future inflation , although it, too, can be  affected by transitory factors—moved down from 1.8  percent in March to 1.5 percent in April."
" In addition, CPI inflation in May came in lower than expected."
" Most participants viewed the recent softness in these  price data as largely reflecting idiosyncratic factors, including sharp declines in prices of wireless telephone services and prescription drug s, and expected these developments to have little bearing on inflation over the medium run."
" Participants continued to expect that, as the effects of transitory factors waned and labor market conditions strengthened further, inflation would stabilize aroun d the Committee’s 2 percent objective over the medium term."
" However, several  participants expressed concern that progress toward the Committee’s 2 percent longer -run inflation objective might have slowed and that the recent softness in inflation might persist."
" However, a couple of other participants raised the concern that a tighter relationship between inflation Page 8Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________   and reso urce utilization could reemerge if the unemployment rate ran significantly below its longer -run normal level, which  could result in inflation running persistently above the Committee’s 2 percent objective."
" A number of participants, pointing to improved prospects for foreign economic growth, viewed the downside risks to the U.S. economic outlook stemming from international developments as having receded further over the intermeeting period."
" With regard to the outlook for inflation, some participants emphasized downside risks, particularly in light of the recent low readings on inflation along with measures of inflation compensation and some survey measures of inflation expectations that were still low."
" However, a couple of participants expressed concern that a substantial undershooting of the longer -run normal  rate of unemployment could pose an appreciable upside risk to inflation or give rise to macroeconomic or financial imbalances that eventually could lead to a significant economic downturn."
 Participants agreed that the Committee should continue to monitor inflation developments closely.
" In their discussion of recent developments in financial markets, partic ipants observed that, over the intermeeting period,  equity prices rose, longer -term interest rates declined, and volatility in financial markets was generally low."
" They also noted that, according to some measures, financial conditions had eased even as the Committee reduced policy accommodation and market participants continued to expect further steps to tighten monetary policy."
" Corporate earnings growth had been robust; nevertheless, in the assessment of a few participants, equity prices were high when judged against standard valuation measures."
" Participants  offered various explanations for low bond yields , including the prospect of sluggish longer -term economic growth as well as the elevated level of the Federal Reserve’s longer -term asset holdings."
" In their discussion of monetary policy, p articipants generally saw the outlook for economic activity and the  medium -term outlook for inflation as little changed and viewed a continued gradual removal of monetary policy accommodation as being appropriate."
" These participants agreed that, even after an increase in the target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting, the stance of monetary policy would remain accommodative, supporting additional strengthening in labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation."
 One participant did not believe it was appropriate to raise the federal funds rate target  range at this meeting; this participant suggested that the Committee should maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at ¾ to 1 percent until the inflation rate was actually moving toward the Committee’s 2 percent longer -run objective.
" However , some  others emphasized that deferring the decision until  later in the year would permit additional time to assess the outlook for economic activity and inflation."
" Several participants expressed confidence  that a series of further increases in the federal funds rate in coming years, along the lines implied by the medians of the  projection s for the federal funds rate in the June SEP, would contribute to a stabilization, over the medium term, of the inflation  rate around  the Committee’s 2 percent  objective, especially as this tightening of monetary policy would affect the economy only with a lag and would start from a point at which policy was still accommodative."
" These participants expressed concern that such a path of increases in the policy rate, while gradual, might prove inconsistent with a sustained return of inflation to 2 percent."
"Several participants endorsed a policy approach, such as that embedded in many participants’ projec tions, in which the unemployment rate would undershoot their current estimates of the longer -term normal rate for a sustained period."
 They noted that the longer -run normal rate of unemployment is difficult to measure and that recent evidence suggested resource pressures generated only modest responses of nominal wage growth and inflation.
" Against this backdrop, possible benefits cited by policymakers of a period of tight labor markets included a further rise in nominal wage growth that would bolster inflation expectations and help push the inflation r ate closer to the Committee’s 2  percent  longer -run goal, as well as a stimulus to labor market participation and business fixed investment."
" It was also suggested that the symmetry of the Committee’s inflation goal might be underscored if inflation modestly exceeded 2 percent for a time, as such an outcome would follow a long period in which inflation had undershot the 2 percent longer -term objective."
" Several participants expressed concern that a substantial and sustained unemployment undershooting might make the economy more likely to experien ce financial instability or could lead to a sharp rise in inflation that would require a rapid policy tightening that, in turn, could raise the risk of an economic downturn."
" However, other participants noted that if a sharp rise in inflation or inflation expectations did occur, the Committee could readily respond using conventional monetary policy tools."
" With regard to financial stability, one participant  emphasized the importance of remaining vigilant about financial developments but observed that previous episodes of elevated financial imbalances and low unemployment had limited relevance for the present situation, as the current system of financial regulation was likely more robust than that prevailing before  the financial crisis."
"Committee Policy Actio n In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in May indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising moderately so far this year."
" Job gains had moderated but had been solid, on average, since the beginning of the year, and the unemployment rate had declined."
 Inflation on a 12 -month basis had declined recently and was running somewhat below 2 percent.
 The measure of inflation excluding food and energy prices was likewise running somewhat below 2 percent.
 Market -based measures of inflatio n compensation remained low;  survey -based measures of longer -term inflation expectations had changed little on balance.
" With respect to the economic outlook and its implications for monetary policy, members continued to expect that, with gradual adjus tments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity would expand at a moderate pace, and labor market conditions would strengthen somewhat further."
" Inflation on a 12 -month basis was expected to remain somewhat below 2 percent in the near term, but almost all members expected it to stabilize around 2 percent over the medium term, al though they Page 10Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________   were monitoring inflation developments closely."
" After assessing current conditions and the out look for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, all but one member agreed to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 1 to 1¼ percent."
" They noted that the stance of monetary policy remained accommodative, thereby supporting some further strengthening in labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation."
" Members agreed that, in determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee would assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation."
" This assessment would take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pr essures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
 Members also agreed that they would carefully monitor actual and expected developments in inflation in relation to the Committee’s symmetric inflation goal.
” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00  p.m.: “Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in May indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising moderately so far this year.
" Job gains have moderated but have been solid, on average, since the beginning of the year, and the unemployment rate has declined."
" On a  12month basis, inflation has declined recently and, like the measure excluding food and energy prices, is running somewhat below 2  percent ."
" Market -based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey -based measures of longer -term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance."
" Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment Minutes of the Meeting of June 13–14, 2017Page 11_____________________________________________________________________________________________   and price stability."
" The Committee continues to expect that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, and labor market cond itions will strengthen somewhat further."
 Inflation on a 12 -month basis is expected to remain somewhat below 2  percent  in the near term but to stabilize around the Committee ’s 2 percent  objective over the medium term.
" Near -term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced, but the Committee is monitoring inflation developments closely."
" In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 1 to 1¼  percen t."
" The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting some further strengthening in labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2  percent  inflation."
" In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2  percent inflation."
" This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
 The Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to its symmetric i nflation goal.
" In his view, recent data, while suggesting that the labor market had improved further, had increased doubts about achievement of the Committee’s 2 percent longer -run inflation objective and thus had not provided a compelling basis on which to firm monetary pol icy at this meeting."
 He preferred to await additional evidence that the recent decline in inflation was temporary and that inflation was moving toward the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent inflation objective.
 He was concerned that raising the federal fund s rate target range too soon increased the likelihood that inflation expectations would decline and that inflation would continue to run below 2 percent.
" To support the Committee ’s decision to raise the tar get range for the federal funds rate, the Board of  Governors voted unanimously to raise the interest rates on required and excess reserve balances ¼  percent age point, to 1¼ percent , effective June 15 , 2017."
"Madigan  Secretary                                                   Board’s approval of their establishment of a primary credit rate of 1¾  percent, effective June 15, 2017.)  The second vote of the Board also encompassed approval of the establishment of the interest rates for secondary and seasonal credit under the existing formulas for computing such rates."
" Minutes of the Meeting of June 13–14, 2017Page 13_____________________________________________________________________________________________   Summary of Economic Projections In conjunction with the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting held on June  13–14 , 2017, meeting participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real output growth, the  unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2017 to 2019 and over the longer run.1  Each participant’s projection was based on information available at the time of the meeting, together with his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy, including a path for the federal funds rate and its longer -run value, and assumptions about other factors likely to affect economic outcomes.2  The longer -run projections represent each participant’s assessment of the value to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy.3  “Appropriate monetary policy” is defined as the future path of policy that each participant deems most likely to foster outcomes for eco nomic activity and inflation that best satisfy his or her individual interpretation of the Federal Reserve’s objectives of maximum employment and stable prices."
" All participants who submitted longer -run projections expected that, under appropriate mone tary policy, growth in real gross domestic product (GDP) this year would run somewhat above their individual estimates of its longer -run rate ."
" Over half of these participants expected that economic growth would slow a bit in 2018, and almost all  of them  expected that  in 2019  economic growth would run at or near  its longer -run level."
 All participant s who submitted longer -run projections expected that the unemployment rate would run below their estimates of its longer -run normal level in 2017 and remain below that level through 2019.
 The majority of participants also lowered their estimates of the longer -run normal rate of unemployment  by 0.1 to 0 .2 percentage point.
" All participants projected that inflation, as measured by the four -quarter percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), would run below 2 percent in 2017  and then step up in  the next two years; over half  of them  projected that inflation would be at the Committee’s 2  percent objective                                                  1 Four members of the Board of Governors, one fewer than in March 2017, were in office at the time of the June 2017 meeting and submitted economic projections."
"  in 2019, and all judged  that inflation would be within a couple of tenths of a percentage point of the objective in that year."
" As shown in figure 2, participants generally  expected that evolving economic conditions would likely warrant further gradual increases in the federal funds rate to achieve and sustain maximum employment and 2 percent inflation."
" However, the economic outlook is uncertain, and participants noted that their ec onomic projections and assessments of appropriate monetary policy could change in response to incoming information."
" In general,  participants viewed the uncertainty attached to their projections as broadly similar to the average of the past 20 years, al though a couple  of participants saw the uncertainty associated with their real GDP growth forecasts as higher than average ."
" Most p articipants judged the risks around their projections for economic growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as broadly balanced."
" Figures 4.A through 4.C for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation, respectively, present “fan charts” a s well as charts of participants’ current assessments of the uncertainty and risks surrounding the economic projections."

Longerrun projections represent each participant’s assessment of the rate to which eachvariable would be expected to converge under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy.

"One participant did notsubmit longerrun projections for the federal funds rate.Page 4Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________   Reflecting, in part, the uncertainty about the future evolution of GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation, participants’ assessments of appropriate monetary policy are also subject to considerable uncertainty."
" To illustrate the uncertainty regarding the appropriate path for monetary policy, figure 5 shows a comparable fan chart around the median projecti ons for the federal funds rate.4  As with the macroeconomic variables, forecast uncertainty for the federal funds rate is substantial and increases at longer horizons."
" The Outlook for Economic Activity  The median of participants’ projections for the growth rate of real GDP, conditional on their individual assumptions about appr opriate monetary policy, was 2.2 percent in 2017, 2.1 percent in 2018, and 1.9  percent in 2019; the median of projections for the longer -run normal rate of r eal GDP growth was 1 .8 percent."
" Compared with the March  Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), the medians of the forecasts for real GDP growth over the period from 2017 to 2019, as well as the median assessment of the longer -run growth rate, were mostly unchanged ."
"All participants revised down their projectio ns for the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of 2017 and of  2018, and almost all also revised down their projections for the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of 2019."
 Many who did so cited recent lower -thanexpected readings on unemployment.
" The median of the projection s for the unemployment rate was 4.3  percent in 2017 and 4.2 percent in each of 2018 and 2019, 0.2 percentage point and 0.3  percentage point lower  than in the  March  projections , respectively ."
" The majority o f participants also revised down their estimates of the longer -run normal rate of unemployment by 0.1 or 0.2  percentage point, and the median longerrun level was 4.6 percent, down 0.1  percentage point from March."
  Figures 3.A and 3.B show the distributions of participants’ projections for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate from 2017 to 2019 and in the longer run.
" The distribution of individual projections for real GDP growth for this year shifted up , with some participants now expecting real GDP growth between 2.4 and                                                  4 The fan chart for the federal funds rate depicts the uncertainty about the future path of appropriate monetary policy and is closely connected with the uncertainty about the future value of economic variables."
" The distributions of projected real GDP growth in 2018, 2019 , and in the longer run were  broadly similar to the distribution s of the March projections."
 The distributions of individual projections for the unemployment rate shifted down  noticeably for 2017  and 2018.
" Most participants projected  an unemployment rate of 4.2 or 4.3 percent at the end of this year, and the majority  anticipated an unempl oyment rate between 4.0 and 4.3  percent at the end of 2018."
 Participants’ projections also shifted down in 2019 but were more dispersed than the distributions of their projected unemployment rates in the two earlier years.
 The distribution  of projections for the longer -run normal unemployment rate shifted  down  modestly .
"The Outlook for Inflation  The median of projections for headline  PCE price  inflation this year  was 1.6 percent , down 0.3  percentage point from March ."
" As in March, median  projected inflation was 2.0 percent in 2018 and 2019 ."
" About half of the participants anticipated that inflation w ould continue to run a bit below 2  percent in 2018, while only one participant expected  inflation above 2 percent in that year—and, in that case, just modestly so ."
 More than half projected that inflation would be equal to the Committee’s objective in 2019 .
" A few  participants projected that inflation w ould run slightly below 2 percent in that year , while several projected th at it would run a little above 2 percent ."
" The median of projection s for core PCE price inflation  was 1.7 percent  in 2017, a decline of 0.2 percentage point from March ; the median projection for 2018 and 2019  was 2.0 percent , as in the March projections."
 Figures 3.C and 3.D provide information on the distributions of participants’ views about the outlook for inflation.
" The distributions of projections for headline PCE price inflation and for core PCE price inflation in 2017 shifted down noticeably from March , while the distributions for both measures of inflation in 2018 shifted down slightly."
 Many participants cited  recent surprisingly low readings on inflation  as a factor contributing to the revisions in their inflation forecasts .
Appropriate Monetary Policy  Figure 3.E provides the distribution of participants’ judgments regarding the appropriate target or midpoint  of the target range for the federal funds rate at the end  in figure  2 displays the dispersion of views across individual participants about the appropriate level of the federal funds rate.

" That anticipated pace reflected a few factors, such as a neutral real interest rate that was currently low and was e xpected to move up only                                                  5 One participant’s projections for the federal funds rate, real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation were informed by the view that there are multiple possible medium -term regimes for the U.S. economy, that these regimes are persistent, and th at the economy  shifts between regimes in a way   slowly as well as a gradual return of  inflation to the Committee’s 2  percent objective."
" Several participants judged that a slightly more accommodative path of monetary policy than in their previous projections would likely be appropriate, citing an apparently  slower rate of progress toward  the Committee’s 2 percent inflation objective."
" In their discussions of appropriate monetary policy, half of the participants commented on the Committee’s reinvestment policy; all of those who did so expected a change in reinvestment policy before the end of this year."
" In assessing the path of monetary policy that, in their view, is likely to be most appropriate, FOMC participants take account of the range of possible outcomes, the likelihood of those outcomes , and the potential benefits and costs to the economy should they occur."
" Table 2 provides one measure of forecast uncertainty for the change in real GDP, the unemployment rate, and total consumer price inflation—the root mean squared error (RMSE) for forecasts made over the past 20 years."
" Under this view, the economy currently is in a regime characterized by expansion of economic activity with low productivity growth and a low short -term real interest rate, but longer -term outcomes for variables other than inflation cannot be usefully projected."

"Fordeﬁnitions of uncertainty and risks in economic projections, see the box“Forecast Uncertainty.”Page 14Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________   uncertainty attached to their economic projections as broadly similar to the average of the past 20 years, with three fewer participants than in March seeing uncertainty about GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as higher than its historical average.6  In their discussion of the uncertainty attached to their current projections, most  participants again expressed the view  that, at this point, uncertainty surrounding prospective changes in fiscal and other government policies is very large or that there is not yet enough information to make reasonable assumptions about the timing, nature, and magnitude of the changes."
" Participants’ assessments of the balance of risks to their economic projections are shown in the bottom -right panels of figures 4.A, 4.B, and 4.C.  As in March, most participants judged the risks to their projections of real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, headline inflation, and core inflation as broad ly balanced —in other words,  as broadly consistent with a symmetric fan chart."
"  Three participants judged the risks to the unemployment rate as weighted to the downside, and o ne participant judged the risks as weighted to the upside ( as shown in the lower -right panel of figure 4.B)."
" In addition, the balance of risks to participants’ inflation projections shifted down slightly from  March (shown in the lower -right panels of figure 4.C), as two fewer participants judged the risks to inflation to be weighted t o the upside and two more viewed the risks as weighted to the downside."
" Participants’ assessments of the future path of the federal funds rate consistent with appropriate policy are also subject to considerable uncertainty, reflecting in part uncertainty about the evolution of GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation over  time."
 The final line in table  2 shows the RMSEs for forecasts of short -term interest rates.
" These RMSEs are not strictly consistent with the SEP projections for the federal  funds rate, in part because the SEP projections are not forecasts of the likeliest outcomes but rather reflect each participant’s individual assessment of appropriate monetary policy."
" However, the associated confidence intervals provide a sense of the likely uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables and  additional adjustments to monetary policy that may be appropriate to offset the effects of shocks to the economy."
 This approach to the construction of the federal funds rate fan chart would be merely a convention and would not have any implication for possible future policy decisions regarding the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so were appropriate.
"The conﬁdence interval is not strictly consistent with theprojections for the federal funds rate, primarily because these projections are not forecasts of the likeliest outcomes forthe federal funds rate, but rather projections of participants’ individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy.Still, historical forecast errors provide a broad sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rategenerated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policythat may be appropriate to oﬀset the eﬀects of shocks to the economy.The conﬁdence interval is assumed to be symmetric except when it is truncated at zero—the bottom of the lowesttarget range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted in the past by the Committee."
This truncation wouldnot be intended to indicate the likelihood of the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary policyaccommodation if doing so was judged appropriate.
"Because currentconditions may diﬀer from those that prevailed, on average, over the previous 20 years, the width and shape of theconﬁdence interval estimated on the basis of the historical forecast errors may not reﬂect FOMC participants’ currentassessments of the uncertainty and risks around their projections.* The conﬁdence interval is derived from forecasts of the average level of shortterm interest rates in the fourthquarter of the year indicated; more information about these data is available in table 2."
The shaded area encompassesless than a 70 percent conﬁdence interval if the conﬁdence interval has been truncated at zero.Page 16Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________        Forecast Uncertainty The economic projections provided by the members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks inform discussions of monetary policy among policymakers and can aid public understanding of the basis for policy actions.
" Thus, in setting the stance of monetary policy, participants consider not only what appears to be the most likely economic outcome a s embodied in their projections, but also the range of alternative possibilities, the likelihood of their occurring, and the potential costs to the economy should they occur."
" Table 2 summarizes the average historical accuracy of a range of forecasts, including those reported in past Monetary Policy Report s and those prepared by the Federal Reserve Board’s staff in advance of meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)."
" The corresponding 70  percent confidence intervals for overall inflation would be 1.2 to 2.8  percent in the current year, and 1.0 to 3.0  percent in the second and third years ."
" Figures 4.A through 4.C illustrate these confidence bounds in “fan charts” that are symmetric and centered on the medians of FOMC participants’ projections for GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation."
" In particular, the unemployment rate cannot be negative; furthermore, the risks around a particular projection might be tilted to either the upside or the downside, in which case the corresponding fan chart would be asymmetrically positioned around the median projection."
" These judgments are summarized in the lower -right panels of figures 4.A through 4.C.  As with real activity and inflation, the outlook for the future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable uncertainty."
 This uncertainty arises primarily because each participant ’s assessment of the appropriate stance of monetary policy depends importantly on the evolution of real  activity and inflation over time.
 The final line in table  2 shows the error ranges for forecasts of short -term interest rates.
" It should be noted, however, that these confidence intervals are not strictly consistent with the projections for the federal funds rate, as these projections are not forecasts of the most likely quarterly outcomes but rather are projections of participants’ individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy and are on an end -ofyear basis."
" Ho wever, the forecast errors should provide a sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy that would be appropri ate to offset the effects of shocks to the economy."
 This approach to the construction of the federal funds rate fan chart would be merely a convention; it would not have any implications for possible future policy decisions regarding the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so were appropriate.
