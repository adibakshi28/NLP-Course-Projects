"States and abroad, the potential for increased regulatory oversight of U.S. technology companies, and incoming data suggesting some moderation in global economic growth."
" The rise in nominal U.S. Treasury yields was associated with an increase in inflation compensation that, in turn, seemed to reflect a firming in inflation data as well as a notable rise in crude oil prices."
" In large part, this development seemed to reflect a firming in rates on repurchase agreements (repos) that, in turn, had resulted from an increase in Treasury bill issuance and the associated higher demands for repo financing by dealers and others."
"In their discussion of this issue, participants generally agreed that it could become appropriate to make a small technical adjustment in the Federal Reserve’s approach to implementing monetary policy by setting the IOER rate modestly below the top of the target range for the federal funds rate."
" A number of participants also suggested that, before too long, the Committee might want to further discuss how it can implement monetary policy most effectively and efficiently when the quantity of reserve balances reaches a level appreciably below that seen in recent years."
" Consumer price inflation, as measured by the 12 ‐month percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), was 2 percent in March."
" Survey ‐based measures of longerrun inflation expectations were, on balance, little changed."
"Total nonfarm payroll employment rose less in March than in the previous two months, but the increase for the first quarter as a whole was solid."
 The national unemployment rate remained at 4.1 percent for a sixth consecutive month.
" Similarly, the unemployment rates for African Americans, Asians, and Hisp anics were roughly flat, on balance, in recent months."
" The rate of privatesector job openings stayed at an elevated level in February, the rate of quits remained high, and initial clai ms for unemployment insurance benefits continued to be low through midApril."
" The employment cost index for private workers rose 2.8 percent over the 12 months ending in March, and average hourly earnings for all employees increased 2.7 percent over that period."
" Light motor vehicle sales stepped down in the first quarter after a strong fourthquarter pace that was partly boosted by replacement sales following the fall hurricanes; sales declined in April, but indicators of vehicle demand remained upbeat."
" More broadly, key factors that influence consumer spending—including gains in employment and real disposable personal income, along with households’ elevated net worth—should continue to support solid real PCE growth in the near term."
"The nominal U.S. international trade deficit widened in February as imports rose briskly, outpacing the increase in exports."
" Preliminary data on trade in goods suggested that the trade deficit narrowed sharply in March, with exports continuing to grow robustly but imports retracing earlier gains."
 The Bureau of Economic Analysis estimated that the change in real net exports added slightly to growth of real GDP in the first quarter.
" Core PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in consumer food and energy prices, was 1.9 percent over that same period."
" The consumer price index (CPI) rose 2.4 percent over the 12 months ending in March, while core CPI inflation was 2.1 percent."
" Recent readings on surveybased measures of longerrun inflation expectations—including those from the Michigan survey, the Survey of Professional Forecasters, and the Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants—were little changed on balance."
Incoming data suggested that foreign economic activity continued to expand at a solid pace.
" Real GDP growth picked up in the first quarter in several emerging market economies (EMEs), including Mexico, China, and some other parts of emerging Asia."
" However, incoming data in a number of advanced foreign economies (AFEs)—in particular, real GDP in the United Kingdom—showed somewhat slower growth than market participants were expecting, partly because of transitory factors such as severe weather."
" Over all, inflation in most AFEs and EMEs continued to be su bdued, increasing in the AFEs in the first quarter on higher energy prices but Page 4                                                                                                                                                                              _Federal Open Market Committeestepping down some in the EMEs, partly reflecting lower food prices in some Asian economies."
" Equity prices declined, nominal Treasury yields increased modestly, and marketbased measures of inflation compensation ticked up on net."
FOMC communications over the intermeeting period were generally viewed by market participants as reflecting an upbeat outlook for economic growth and as consistent with a continued gradual removal of monetary policy accommodation.
" Measures of inflation compensation derived from Treasury InflationProtected Securities increased 4 basis points and 7 basis points at the 5and 5to-10year horizons, respectively, against a backdrop of rising oil prices."
 Optionimplied measures of volatility of longerterm interest rates continued to decline over the intermeeting period after their marked increase earlier this year.
Growth in banks’ commercial and industrial (C&I) loans strengthened in March and th e first half of April following relatively weak growth in January and February.
 CRE loan growth at banks strengthened in March but edged down in the first half of April.
" Meanwhile, respondents indicated weaker demand for loans across these three CRE loan categories."
" Banks responding to the April SLOOS reported weaker loan demand across most residential real estate (RRE) loan categories, while standards were reportedly about unchanged for most RRE loan types in the first quarter."
Consumer credit growth moderated in March and the first half of April.
" Respondents to the April SLOOS reported that standards and terms on auto and credit card loans tightened, and that demand for these loans weakened in the first quarter."
Staff Economic Outlook The staff projection for U.S. economic activity prepared for the May FOMC meeting continued to suggest that the economy was expanding at an abovetrend pace.
" Real GDP growth, which slowed in the first quarter, was expected to pick up in the second quarter and to outpace potential output growth through 2020."
 The unemployment rate was projected to decline further over the next few years and to continue to run below the staff’s estimate of its longerrun natural rate over this period.
" Relative to the forecast prepared for the March meeting, the projection for real GDP growth in 2018 was revised down a little, primarily in response to incoming consumer spending data that were somewhat softer than the staff had expected."
" Beyond 2018, the projection for GDP growth was essentially un revised."
" With real GDP rising a little less, on balance, over the forecast period, the projected decline in the unemployment rate over the next few years was also a touch smaller than in the previous forecast."
The nearterm projection for consumer price inflation was revised up slightly in response to incoming data on prices.
" Beyond the near term, the forecast for inflation was a bit lower than in the previous projection, reflecting the slightly higher unemployment rate in the new forecast."
 The rates of both total and core PCE price inflation were projected to be faster in 2018 than in 2017.
 The staff projected that total PCE inflation would be near the Committee’s 2 percent objective over the next several years.
 Total PCE inflation was expected to run slightly below core inflati on in 2019 and 2020 because of a projected decline in energy prices.
"The staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as similar to the average of the past 20 years."
 The staff saw the risks to the fo recasts for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate as balanced.
" On the upside, recent fiscal policy changes could lead to a greater expansion in economic activity over the next few years than the staff projected."
 Risks to the inflation projection also were seen as balanced.
 An upside risk was that inflation could increase more than expected in an economy that was projected to move further above its potential.
 Do wnside risks included the possibilities that longerter m inflation expectations may be lower than was assumed or that the run of low core inflation readings last year could prove to be more persistent than the staff expected.
"Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants agreed that information received since the FOMC met in March indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising at a moderate rate."
" Job gains had been strong, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate had stayed low."
" Recent data suggested that growth of household spending had moderated from its strong fourthquarter pace, while business fixed investment had continued to grow strongly."
" On a 12month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy had moved close to 2 percent."
" Marketbased measures of inflation compensation remained low; survey -based measures of longerterm inflation expectations were little changed, on balance."
"Participants viewed recent readings on spending, employment, and inflation as suggesting little change, on balance, in their assessments of the economic outlook."
" Real GDP growth slowed somewhat less in the first quarter than anticipated at the time of the March meeting, and participants expected that the moderation in the growth of consumer spending early in the year would prove temporary."
" They noted a number of economic fundamentals were currently supporting continued abovetrend economic growth; these included a strong labor market, federal tax and spending policies, high levels of household and business confidence, favorable financial conditions, and strong economic growth abroad."
" Participants generally expected that further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would be consistent with solid expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective over the medium term."
" Activity in  the energy sector remained strong, and crude oil produc tion was expected to continue to expand in response to rising global demand."
" Nonfarm payroll employment posted strong gains, averaging 200,000 per month."
" The unemployment rate was unchanged, but at a level below most estimates of its longerrun normal rate."
 Both the overall labor force participation rate and the employmentto-population ratio moved up.
" The firstquarter data from the employment cost index indicated th at the strength in the labor market was showing through to a gradual pickup in wage increases, although the signal from other wage measures was less clear."
" With economic growth anticipated to remain above trend, participants generally expected the unemployment rate to remain below, or to decline further below, their estimates of its longerrun normal rate."
" Most participants viewed the recent firming in inflation as providing some  reassurance that inflation Minutes of the Meeting of May 1–2, 2018_                                                                                                                                                                              Page 7was on a trajectory to achieve the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective on a sustained basis."
 Some participants noted that  inflation was likely to modestly overshoot 2 percent for a time.
" However, several participants suggested that the underlying trend in inflation had changed little, noting that some of the recent increase in inflation may have represented transitory price changes in some categories of health care and financial services, or that various measures of underlying inflation, such as the 12month trimmed mean PCE inflation rate from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, remained relatively stable at leve ls below 2 percent."
" In discussing the outlook for inflation, many participants emphasized that, after an extended period of low inflation, the Committee’s longerrun policy objective was to return inflation to its symmetric 2 percent goal on a sustained basis."
" Many saw tight resource utilization, the pickup in wage increases and nonlabor input costs, and stable inflation expectations as supporting their projections that inflation would remain near 2 percent over the medium term."
" But a few cautioned that, although marketbased measures of inflation compensation had moved up over recent months, in their view these measures, as well as some surveybased measures, remained at levels somewhat below those that would be consistent with an expectation of sustained 2 percent inflation as measured by the PCE price index."
"Participants commented on a number of risks and uncertainties associated with their expectations for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation over the medium term."
" Alternatively, some participants thought that a strengthening labor market could bring a further increase in labor supply, allowing the unemployment rate to decline further with less upward pressure on wages and prices."
" With regard to trade policies, a number of participants viewed the range of possible outcomes for economic activity and inflation to be particularly wide, depending on what actions were taken by the United States and how U.S trading partners responded."
" In their discussion of the outlook for inflation, a few participants also noted the risk that, if global oil prices remained high or moved higher, U.S. inflation would be boosted by the direct effects and passthroug h of higher energy costs."
"In their consideration of monetary policy over the near term, participants discussed the implications of recent economic and financial developments for the outlook for economic growth, labor market conditions, and inflation and, in turn, for the appropriate path of the federal funds rate."
" Participants commented that abovetrend growth Page 8                                                                                                                                                                              _Federal Open Market Committeein real GDP in recent quarters, together with somewhat higher recent inflation read ings, had increased their confidence that inflation on a 12month basis would continue to run near the Committee’s longerrun 2 percent symmetric objective."
" That said, it was noted that it was premature to conclude that inflation would remain at levels around 2 percent, especially after several years in which inflation had persistently run below the Committee’s 2 percent objective."
" In light of subdued inflation over recent years, a few participants observed that adjustments in the stance of po licy should take account of the possibility that longerterm inflation expectations have drifted a bit below levels consistent with the Committee’s 2 percent inflation objective."
" Overall, participants agreed that the current stance of monetary policy remained accommodative, supporting strong labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation on a sustained basis."
"With regard to the mediumterm outlook for monetary policy, all participants reaffi rmed that adjustments to the path for the policy rate would depend on their assessments of the evolution of the economic outlook and risks to the outlook relative to the Committee’s statutory objectives."
 These participants commented that this gradual approach was most likely to be conducive to ma intaining strong labor market conditions and achieving the symmetric 2 percent inflation objective on a sustained basis without resulting in conditions that would eventually require an abrupt policy tightening.
" A few participants commented that recent news on inflation, against a background of continued prospects for a solid pace of economic growth, supported the view that inflation on a 12month basis would likely move slightly above the Committee’s 2 percent objective for a time."
 It was also noted that a temporary period of inflation modestly above 2 percent would be consistent with the Committee’s symmetric inflation objective and could be helpful in anchoring longerrun inflation expectations at a level consistent with that objective.
  Meeting participants also discussed the recent flatter profile of the term structure of interest rates.
"Participants pointed to a number of factors contributing to the flattening of the yield curve, including the expected gradual rise of the federal funds rate, the downward pressure on term premiums from the Federal Reserve’s stilllarge balance sheet as well as asset purchase programs by other central banks, and a reduction in investors’ estimates of the longerrun neutral real interest rate."
 A few participants noted that such factors could make the slope of the yield curve a less reliable signal of future economic activity.
" In light of this, some participants noted it might soon be appropriate to revise the forwardguidance language in the statement indicating that the “federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run” or to modify the language stating that “the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative.”  Participants expressed a range of views on the amount of further policy firming that would likely be required over the medium term to achieve the Committee’s goals."
" Participants indicated that the Committee, in making policy decisions over the next few years, should conduct policy with the aim of keepin g inflation near its longerrun symmetric objective while sustaining the economic expansion and a strong labor market."
"Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that information received since the Committee met in March indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising at a moderate rate."
" Job gains had been strong, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate had stayed low."
" Recent data suggested that growth of household sp ending had moderated from its strong fourthquarter pace, while business fixed investment continued to grow strongly."

" Marketbased measures of inflation compensation remained low, and surveybased measures of longerterm inflation expectations were little changed, on balance."
" Consequently, members expected that, with  further gradual adjustments to the stance of monetary policy, economic activity would expand at a moderate pace in the medium term and labor market conditions would remain strong."
 Members agreed that inflation on a 12month basis is expected to run near the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective over the medium term.
"After assessing current conditions and the outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, members agreed to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1½ to 1¾ percent."
" They noted that the stance of monetary policy remained accommodative, thereby supporting some further strengthening in labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation."
Members agreed that the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate would depend on their assessments of realized and expected economic conditions relative to the Committee’s objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.
" They reiterated that this assessment would take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and internationa l developments."
 Members also agreed that they would carefully monitor actual and expected developments in inflation in relation to the Committee’s symmetric inflation goal.
The Committee also directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve’s agency mortgagebacked securities transactions.” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p.m.: “Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in March indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising at a moderate rate.

"Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
" The Committee expects that, with further gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace in the medium term and labor market conditions will remain strong."
 Inflation on a 12month basis is expected to run near the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective over the medium term.
"In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1½ to 1¾ percent."

 The Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to its symmetric inflation goal.
"Consistent with the Committee’s decision to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the Board of Governors voted unanimously to leave the interest rates on required and excess reserve balances unchanged at 1¾ percent and voted unanimously to approve establishment of the primary credit rate (discount rate) at the existing level of 2¼ percent.5 It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday–Wednesday, June 12–13, 2018."
Clouse Secretary                                                   5 The second vote of the Board also encompassed approval of the establishment of the interest rates for secondary and seasonal credit under the existing  formulas for computing such rates.
