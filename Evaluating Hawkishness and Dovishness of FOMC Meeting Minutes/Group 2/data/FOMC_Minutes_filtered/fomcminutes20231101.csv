" Financial conditions continued to tighten, driven by higher Page 2Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ yields on Treasury securities as well as by lower equity prices and a stronger dollar, which themselves partly reflected higher interest rates."
" Because earnings expectations had held up well in recent months, the effect of higher interest rates on equity prices likely took place largely through valuations."
" There were small increases in inflation compensation, but the levels of spot and forward rates were within historical ranges."
" The manager also noted that survey measures pointed to generally stable inflation expectations, especially at longer horizons, and that inflation expectations remained well anchored."
 The manager turned next to expectations for monetary policy.
" Labor market conditions remained tight, with continued strong job gains and a low unemployment rate."
 Consumer price inflation remained elevated.
 Labor demand and supply were slowly moving into better alignment.
" Easing labor market imbalances were apparent in the wage data, with the 12 -month changes in average hourly earnings and the employment cost index each below their year -earlier levels."
" Although total nonfarm payroll employment rose at a faster pace in September than in previous months, the unemployment rate was unchanged at 3.8  percent; the labor force participation rate and the employmentto-population ratio were also unchanged in September."
" The unemployment rate for African Americans rose , while the jobless rate for Hispanics declined; both rates were higher than the national average."
 Consumer price inflation remained elevated but continued to show signs of slowing.
" The price index for total personal consumption expenditures (PCE) increased 3.4 percent  over the 12  months ending in September , while core PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in energy prices and many consumer food prices, was 3.7 percent  over the same period; both total and core _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of October 31–November 1, 2023Page 3 PCE price inflation were well below their year -earlier levels."
" The trimmed mean measure of 12 -month PCE price inflation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas was 3.8 percent  in September, also down from the level posted a year ago."
 Survey measures of consumers’ short -run inflation expectations remained above their prepandemic levels.
" In contrast, survey measures of mediumto longer -term inflation expectations remained in the range seen in th e decade before the pandemic."
" Net exports made a slightly negative contribution to U.S. GDP growth in the third quarter, while the nominal trade deficit narrowed somewhat."
 Foreign economic growth remained subdued in the third quarter.
" Monetary policy restraint weighed on activity abroad, especially in Europe, where euroarea GDP growth registered a small decline and the latest European Central Bank lending survey pointed to a contraction in credit from a year ago."
" Although  GDP growth in China improved in the third quarter, supported by an increase in industrial production, Chinese retail sales continued to be held back by low consumer confidence and weakness in the residential property sector."
 Inflation abroad remained elevated.
" While core inflation continued to ease amid slowing aggregate demand, energy price inflation increased in many foreign economies."
" With inflation still high, most major foreign central banks, while keeping their policy rates unchanged, indicated their intentions to hold these rates at sufficiently restrictive levels to bring inflation back to target rates."
" Shortterm inflation compensation fluctuated notably over the intermeeting period, largely following the changes in energy prices, but ended the period modestly lower ."
" Equity prices in interest rate– sensitive sectors, such as real estate and utilities, underperformed the broader market."
 Stronger -thanexpected U.S. data on economic activity and widening interest rate differentials between the U.S. and the rest of the world contributed to an increase in the staff’s broad dollar index.
" Interest rates on commercial and industrial (C&I) loans and small business loans increased, as did rates on loans to households, including for 30 -year conforming residential mortgages, new auto loans, and credit cards."
" Banks also reported that demand for C&I loans weakened in the third quarter, with the most frequently cited reasons being decreased investment in plant or equipment and decreased inventory financing needs."
" Similarly, banks indicated that commercial real estate (CRE) loan standards continued to tighten and demand weakened further in the third quarter."
" However, in the October SLOOS, banks reported tighter standards and weaker demand for almost all categories of residential real estate loans in the third quarter."
" However, the fair value of banks’ long erterm fixed -rate assets, including loans, decreased in the third quarter as long erterm interest rates rose."
 The staff expected fourth -quarter GDP growth to slow markedly from its third -quarter rate.
" All told, however, average GDP growth over the second half of the year was projected to be a little faster than the first half’s pace."
" With the lagged effects of monetary policy actions expected to restrain activity, real GDP was projected to rise more slowly than the staff’s estimate of potential over the next two years before rising in line with potential in 2026."
 The unemployment rate was expected to be roughly flat through 2026 as the effects of below -potential output growth were offset by the effects of further improvements in labor market functioning.
" Total PCE price inflation was expected to be close to 3.0 percent  by the end of this year, and core PCE inflation was expected to be around 3.5  percent."
" Inflation was projected to move lower in coming years as demand and supply in product and labor markets moved into better alignment; in 2026, total and core PCE price inflation rates were expected to be close to 2  percent ."
" Risks around the inflation forecast were seen as skewed to the upside, given the possibility that inflation might prove to be more persistent than expected or that add itional adverse shocks to supply conditions might occur."
" Moreover, the additional monetary policy tightening that would be necessitated by higher or more persistent inf lation, and the potential for a greater  tightening of financial conditions, represented a downside risk to the projection for real activity."
" Nevertheless, participants judged that aggregate demand and aggregate supply continued to come into better balance, as a result of the current restrictive stance of monetary policy and the continued normalization of aggregate supply conditions."
 Participants judged that the current stance of monetary policy was restrictive and was putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation.
 Participants noted that inflation had moderated over the past year but stressed that current inflation remained unacceptably high and well above the Committee’s longer -run goal of 2  percent .
 They also stressed that further evidence would be required for t hem to be confident that inflation was clearly on a path to the Committee ’s 2 percent objective.
 Participants continued to view a period of below -potential growth in real GDP and some further softening in labor market conditions as likely to be needed to reduce inflation pressures sufficiently to return inflation to 2  percent  over time.
 Some participants comm ented that their District contacts reported a somewhat weaker picture of consumer demand than indicated by the incoming aggregate data.
 Several participants noted that an increasing number of District businesses were reporting that higher interest rates were affecting their businesses or that firms were increasingly cutting or delaying their investment plans because of higher borrowing costs and tighter bank lending conditions.
" A few participants observed that higher interest rates were also affecting the agricultural sector, with their contacts noting that high financing costs were likely weighing on purchases of heavy  agricultural equipment."
" Payroll growth was unexpectedly strong in September , and the unemployment rate remained low."
" Nevertheless, participants assessed that labor supply and labor demand were continuing to come into better balance."
 A few participants expressed concern that the recent pace of increases in labor supply  might not be sustainable in light of challenges regarding the availability of childcare and the uncertainty regarding the extent to which immigration would continue to boost the growth of labor supply.
"Regarding labor demand, various measures appeared to indicate some easing, including a downward trend in job openings, a lower quits rate, and reduced wage premiums offered to job switchers."
" A few participants noted, however, that nominal wages were still rising at rates above levels generally assessed to be consistent with the sustained achievement of the Committee’s 2 percent inflation objective, given current estimates of trend productivity growth."
 Participants observed that inflation had continued to moderate since the middle of last year.
" Both the 6 - and 12month change measures of core PCE price inflation had come down somewhat in recent months, despite a less favorable monthly reading in September."
" Participants pointed to the softening of core goods prices  in recent months , as well as the  continued  gradual decline in housing services inflation."
" However, participants also noted that there had been only limited progress in bringing down inflation in core services excluding housing."
 Participants noted that longer -term inflation expectations remained  well anchored.
" Participants observed that, notwithstanding the moderation of inflation so far, inflation remained well above the Committee’s 2  percent  longer -run objective and that elevated inflation was continuing to harm businesses and households , particularly lowincome households."
 Participants stressed that they would need to see more data indicating that inflation pressures were abating to be more confident that inflation was on course to return to 2  percent  over time.
" However, they also noted that, whatever the source of the rise in longer -term yields, persistent changes in financial conditions could have implications for the path of monetary policy and that it would therefore be important to continue to monitor market developments closely."
" As upside risks to economic activity, participants noted that the factors behind the resilience in spending  could persist longer than expected ."
" As upside risks to inflation, participants cited the possibility that progress on disinflation stalls or inflation reaccelerates because of continued momentum in economic activity."
 A potential for a broadening of the armed conflict in the Middle East was seen as presenting upside risk to inflation through its potential effect  on oil prices as well as downside risk to economic activity.
" However, many participants commented that unrealized losses on assets resulting from the rise in long erterm interest rates, significant reliance by some banks on uninsured deposits, and increased funding costs at banks warranted monitoring."
" In their consideration of appropriate monetary policy actions at this meeting, participants noted that economic activity expanded at a strong pace in the third quarter and had been resilient."
"  While the labor market remained tight, job gains had moderated, on balance, since earlier in the year, and there were continuing signs that supply and demand in the labor market were coming into better balance."
" While inflation had moderated since the mid dle of last year, it remained well above the Committee’s longer -run goal of 2  percent , and participants remained resolute in their commitment to bring inflation down to the Committee’s 2 percent objective."
" Participants also noted that tighter financial and credit conditions facing households and businesses would likely weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation, although the extent of these effects remained uncertain."
" In discussing the policy outlook, participants continued to judge that it was critical that the stance of monetary policy be kept sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to the Committee’s 2 percent objective over time."
 Participants noted that further tightening of monetary policy would be appropriate if incoming information indicated that progress toward the Committee’s inflation objective was insuffici ent.
" Participants expected that the data arriving in coming months would help clarify the extent to which the disinflation process was continuing, aggregate demand was moderating in the face of tighter financial and credit conditions, and labor markets were reaching a better balance between demand and supply."
 Participants noted the importance of continuing to communicate clearly about the Committee’s datadependent approach and its firm commitment to bring inflation down to 2 percent.
    All participants judged that it would be appropriate for policy to remain at a restrictive stance for some time until inflation is clearly moving down sustainably toward the Committee’s  objective.
" Participants generally judged that, with the stance of monetary policy in restrictive territory, risks to the achievement of the Committee’s goals had become more two sided."
" But with inflation still well above the Committee’s longer -run goal and the labor market remaining tight, most participants continued to see upside risks to inflation."
" These risks included the possibility that the imbalance of aggregate demand and supply could persist longer than expected  and slow the progress on inflation, geopolitical tensions and risks emanating from global oil markets, the effects of a tight housing market on shelter inflation, and the potential for more limited declines in goods prices."
" Many participants commented that even though economic activity had been resilient and the labor market had continued to be strong, downside risks to economic activity remained."
" Such risks included potential ly largerthan-expected  effects  of the tightening in financial and credit conditions on aggregate demand and on bank, business, and household balance sheets; continued weakness in the CRE sector; and potential disruptions to global oil markets."
