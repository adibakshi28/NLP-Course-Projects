" Early in the period, firmerthan- expected data and policy communications pushed interest rates higher and equity prices lower."
"  Regarding the outlook for inflation in the United States, marketbased measures of inflation compensation over shorter horizons rose over the period, al though compensation retraced a good portion of  its increase later in the period as markets reacted to the developments in the banking sector ."
 Forward inflation compensation measures continued to indicate that longer -term inflation expectations remained well anchored.
 Measures of inflation expectations from the Open Market Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants moved higher at shorter horizons and were little changed at longer horizons.
"   Regarding the outlook for monetary policy, marketbased measures of policy expectations suggested that the federal funds rate would reach a peak in May 2023 and that the target range would then move lower."
 Federal funds volumes fell sharply for a few days late in the period as Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs) sought to maintain liquidity in order to meet increase d demand for advances by member banks.
"Staff Review of the Economic Situation  The information available at the time of the March 21–22 meeting indicated that labor market conditions remained tight in January and February, with robust job gains and the unemployment rate near a historical low."
 Consumer price inflation —as measured by the  12month percent change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) —was still elevated in  January.
" Minutes of the Meeting of March 21–22, 2023Page 3_____________________________________________________________________________________________ Total nonfarm payroll employment increased at a faster monthly pace in January and February than in the fourth quarter of last year."
 The unemployment rate was little changed and stood at 3.6 percent in February.
" Over the past two months, the unemployment rate for African Americans was unchanged, on net, and the unemployment rate for Hispanics moved up; the unemployment rates for both groups remained above the aggregate measure."
 The aggregate measures of both the labor force participation rate and the employmentto- population ratio increased slightly.
  Recent indicators of nominal wage growth had slowed but continued to be elevated.
" Over the four quarters of 2022, total labor compensation per hour in the business sector —as measured by the Productivity and Costs data—increased 4.5 percent, below its pace in the previous  year."
 Consumer price inflation remained elevated early in the year.
" Total PCE price inflation was 5.4 percent over the 12 months ending in January, and core PCE price inflation—which excludes changes in consumer energy prices and many consumer food prices —was 4.7  percent."
 The trimmed mean measure of 12 -month PCE price inflation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas was 4.6 percent in January.
" In February, the 12month change in the consumer price index (CPI) was 6.0 percent, and core CPI inflation was 5.5 percent."
" The CPI, along with data from the producer price index, pointed to some slowing in PCE price inflation in February."
" The latest surveybased measures of longer -term inflation expectations from the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers, the Survey of Professional Forecasters, and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Survey of Consumer Expectations remained within the range of their values reported in recent months, while nearterm measures of inflation expectations from thes e surveys moved down."
 Real GDP growth seemed to be expanding at a modest pace in the first quarter.
" Gains in consumer spending had picked up in recent months, but growth in business fixed investment was slowing and residential investment was continuing to decline."
 The nominal U.S. international trade deficit registered a record high in  2022.
 The trade deficit had been narrowing since March of last year but resumed widening in December and January.
 Indicators suggested that foreign economic growth rebounded in the first quarter of 2023 as China reopened rapidly from its COVID19-related shutdowns and Europe’s economy proved to be resilient to the energy price shock stemming from Russia’s war against Ukraine and benefited from a mild winter that reduced energy demand.
" Retail energy inflation continued to slow, contributing to an easing of headline consumer price inflation in many advanced foreign economies  (AFEs) ."
" In contrast, core inflation has shown little sign of easing in most foreign economies amid tight labor markets."
" In response, many foreign central banks continued their monetary policy tightening, although some have either paused or indicated that a pause soon was possible, citing the importance of as sessing the cumulative effects of past policy rate increases."
" Staff Review of the Financial Situation  Over the first several weeks of the intermeeting period, incoming economic data and FOMC communications appeared to refocus market participants on upside risks to inflation and policy rates, with the marketimplied policy rate path steepening, nominal Treasury yields rising, near -term inflation compensation measures increasing, and broad stock market price indexes declining."
" Inflation compensation declined, especially at short maturities, likely reflecting , in part, a relatively larger decline in risk premiums on nominal Treasury securities rela tive to Treasury InflationProtected Securities due to strong safehaven demand s."
" Broad equity prices rose somewhat after the closure s of Silicon Valley Bank  and Signature Bank , reportedly driven by investors’ reassessment of the outlook for interest rates, and after the announcement that UBS had agreed to buy Credit Suisse."
" Swaptionimplied volatilities of short -term interest rates increased notably during this period, reflecting increased uncertainty about the interest rate outlook."
"   Over the intermeeting period, foreign financial markets were volatile as investors’ focus shifted from resilience in economic activity and stubbornly high core inflation across advanced economies earlier in the period to stresses in the global banking sector more recently."
" Earlier in the period, yields and marketbased measures of inflation expectations in the AFEs increased notably, driven by spillovers from U.S. Treasury yields as well as upside surprises in economic and inflation data for AFEs.  Later in the period, developments in the banking sector  led to large declines in advanc edeconomy yields, and, on net, AFE yields declined slightly."
" Amid the se developments , federal funds volumes initially declined sharply as the FHLBs reduced their activity in the federal funds market in order to meet increased demand for advances by member banks; market volume subsequently rebounded  partially."
"  Staff Economic Outlook  For some time, the forecast for the U.S. economy prepared by the staff had featured subdued real GDP growth for this year and some softening  in the labor market."
" Real GDP growth in 2024 was projected to remain below the staff’s estimate of potential output growth, and then GDP growth in 2025 was expected to be above that of potential."
" On a four -quarter change basis, total PCE price inflation was forecast to be 2.8 percent this year, with core inflation at 3.5 percent."
" Core goods inflation was  projected to move down further this year and then remain subdued ; housing services inflation was expected to peak later this year and then move down, while core nonhousing services inflation was forecast to slow gradually as nominal wage growth eased further."
" Reflecting the effects of less projected tightness in product and labor markets, core inflation was forecast to slow sharply next year."
" With steep declines in consumer energy prices and a substantial moderation in food price inflation expected for this year, total inflation was projected to step down markedly this year and then to track core inflation over the following two years."
" In 2024 and 2025, both total and core PCE price inflation were expected to be near 2 percent."
" If the effects of the recent developments in the banking  sector  on macroeconomic conditions were to abate quickly, then the risks around the baseline would be tilted to the upside for both economic activity and inflation."
" If banking and financial conditions and their effects on macroeconomic conditions were to deteriorate more than assumed in the baseline, then the risks around the baseline would be skewed to the downside for both economic activity and inflati on, particularly because historical recessions related to financial market problems tend to be more severe and persistent than average recessions."
"  Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook  In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2023 through 2025 and over the longer run."
" The projections were based on their individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy, including the path of the federal funds rate."
" The longer -run projections represented each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy."
" In their discussion of current economic conditions, participants noted that recent indicators pointed to modest growth in spending and production."
" At the same time, though, participants noted that  job gains had picked up in recent months and were running at a robust pace; the unemployment rate had remained low."
 Inflation remained elevated.
" They commented that recent developments in the banking sector were likely to result in tighter credit conditions for households and businesses and  to weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation."
" Against this Page 6Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ background, participants continued to be highly attentive to inflation risks."
"In assessing the economic outlook, participants noted that since they met in February, data on inflation, employment, and economic activity generally came in stronger than expected."
" With inflation remaining unacceptably high, participants expected that a period of below -trend growth in real GDP would be needed to bring aggregate demand into better balance with aggregate supply and thereby reduce inflationary pressures."
" Participants noted that it was too early to assess with confidence the magnitude of the effect o f a credit tightening on economic activity and inflation, and that it was important to continue to closely monitor developments and update assessments of the actual and expected effects of credit tightening."
" A few participants observed that credit card delinquencies, particularly for lower -income households, had risen in the face of elevated inflation and higher  nominal interest rates."
"  Regarding the business sector, participants observed that growth in business fixed investment was being restrained by tighter financial conditions that reflected cumulative policy firming to date."
" Job gains had picked up to a robust pace in January and February, and the unemployment rate remained low."
" Participants noted some signs of improvement in the imbalances between demand and supply in the labor market, including further declines in the quits rate as well as an increase in the overall labor force participation rate and the return of the primeage participation rate to prepandemic l evels."
" Furthermore, participants observed that wage growth appeared to be slowing  gradually amid this apparent easing in labor demand and increase in labor supply."
" However, participants assessed that labor demand continued to substantially exceed labor supply, and several participants pointed out that wage growth Minutes of the Meeting of March 21–22, 2023Page 7_____________________________________________________________________________________________ was still well above the rates that would be consistent over the longer run  with the 2 percent inflation objective, given current estimates of trend productivity growth."
" Participants expected that, under  appropriate monetary policy, supply and demand conditions in the labor market will come into better balance over time, easing upward pressures on wages and prices."
" With inflation still well above the Committee ’s longer -run goal of 2 percent, participants agreed that inflation was unacceptably high."
 Participants commented that recent inflation data indicated slower -thanexpected progress on disinflation.
" In particular, they noted that revisions to the price data had indicated less disinflation at the end of last year than had been previously reported  and that inflation was still quite elevated."
" Participants noted that, on a 12 -month basis, core goods price inflation declined as supply chains continued to improve, but the pace of the decline had slowed, highlighting the still uncertain nature of the disinflationary process."
" Participants expected that housing services inflation would likely begin to slow in coming mon ths, reflecting continued smaller increases, or potentially declines, in rents on new leases."
" Regarding prices for core services excluding housing, participants agreed that there was little evidence pointing to disinflation in this component."
 Participant s generally judged that some more easing in labor market tightness and slowing in nominal wage growth would be necessary for sustained disinflation.
" Additionally, p articipants observed that indicators of shortterm inflation expectations from surveys of households and businesses had come down further, while longer -term inflation expectations remained well anchored."
 Participants also discussed the potential  effect on inflation of the developments in the banking sector.
" They noted that a tightening of cred it conditions was likely  to weigh on aggregate demand, which in turn c ould help reduce inflationary pressures ."
" Participants generally observed that the recent developments in the banking sector had further increased the already -high level of uncertainty associated with their outlooks for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation."
 Participants saw risks to economic activity as weighted to the downside.
"  As a source of downside risk to activity, they noted the possibility that bank s would reduc e the supply of credit  by more than expected, which could restrain economic activity significantly ."
" Participants generally saw risks to inflation as weighted to the upside, though they also recognized some downside risks to inflation."
" As a source of upside risk to inflation, participants cited the possibility of morepersistent -thananticipated price pressures, due to, for example, surprisingly resilient labor demand."
"  As a source of downside risk to inflation, participants noted  that if bank s reduce the supply of credit by more than expected, the likely restraint on economic activity and hiring  could put additional downward pressure on inflation."
"In their consideration of appropriate monetary policy actions at this meeting, participants concurred that inflation remained well above the Committee’s longer -run goal of 2 percent and that the recent data on inflation provided few signs that inflation pressures were abating at a pace  sufficient to return inflation to 2 percent over time."
" Participants also noted that recent developments in the banking sector  would likely result in tighter credit conditions for households and businesses and weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation, though the extent of these effects was highly uncertain."
 They noted that doing so would allow more time to assess the financial and economic effects of recent banking -sector developments  and of the cumulative tightening of monetary policy.
" However, these participants also observed that the actions taken by the Federal Reserve in coordination with other government agencies helped calm conditions in the banking s ector  and lessen the near -term risks to economic activity and inflation."
" Consequently , these participants judged it appropriate to increase the target range 25 basis points because of elevated inflation, the strength of the recent economic data, and their commitment to bring inflation down to the Committee’s 2 percent longer -run goal."
"  Some participants noted that given persistently high inflation and the strength of the recent economic data, they would have considered a 50  basis point increase in the target range to have been  appropriate at this meeting  in the absen ce of the recent developments in the banking sector ."
" However, due to the potential for banking -sector  developments to tighten financial conditions and to Page 8Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ weigh on economic activity and inflation, they judged it prudent to increase the target range by a smaller increment at this meeting."
 These participants noted that doing so would also allow the Committee time to better  assess the effects of banking -sector developments on credit conditions and the economy as the Committee moved toward a sufficiently restrictive stance of monetary policy.
 Participants agreed that recent banking developments would factor into the Committee’s monetary policy decisions to the extent that these developments affect the outlook for employment and inflation and the risks surrounding the outlook.
 Participants reaffirmed their strong commitment to returning inflation to the Committee’s 2 percent objective.
"  In discussing the policy outlook, participants observed that inflation remained much too high a nd that the labor market remained tight; as a result, they anticipated that some additional policy firming may be appropriate to attain a sufficiently restrictive policy stance to return inflation to 2  percent over time ."
 Many participants noted that the likely effects of recent banking -sector developments  on economic activity and inflation had led them to lower their assessments of the federal funds rate target range that would be sufficiently restrictive compared with assessm ents based solely on the recent economic data.
" In determining the extent of future increases in the target range, participants judged that it would be appropriate to take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments."
"  In light of the highly uncertain economic outlook, participants underscored the importance of closely monitoring incoming information and assessing the implications for future monetary policy decisions."
" Participants noted that it would be particularly important to review incoming information regarding changes in credit conditions and credit flows as well as broader changes in financial conditions and to assess th e implications for economic activity, labor markets, and inflation."
 Several participants emphasized the need to retain flexibility and optionality in determining the appropriate stance of monetary policy given the highly uncertain economic outlook .
    Participants emphasized a number of risk -management considerations related to the conduct of monetary policy.
 Some participants observed that downside risks to growth and upside risks to unemployment had increased because of  the risk that banking -sector dev elopments could lead to further  tightening of  credit conditions and weigh on economic activity.
" Some participants also noted that, with inflation still well above the Committee’s longer -run goal and the recent economic data remaining strong, upside risks to the inflation outlook remained a key factor shaping the policy outlook, and that maintaining a restrictive policy stance until inflation is clearly on a downward path toward 2  percent would be appropriate from a risk -management perspective."
" Several participants noted the importance of longer -term inflation expectations remaining anchored and remarked that the longer inflation remained elevated, the greater the risk of inflation expectations becoming unanchored."
" Committee Policy Actions  In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that recent indicators pointed to modest growth in spending and production."
