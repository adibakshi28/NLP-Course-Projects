 Market participants seemed to interpret communications associated with the June FOMC meeting as signaling a less accommodative path of monetary policy than had been anticipated.
" Implied rates on interest rate futures initially rose following the meeting but subsequently retraced, and expectations regarding the path of the target fed eral funds rate over the next few years ended the period only modestly changed."
"Discussion of Asset Purchases  Participants discussed aspects of  the Federal Reserve’s asset purchases, including progress made toward the Committee’s maximum -employment and price -stability goals since the adoption of the asset purchase guidance in December 2020."
" In that framework, larger Federal Reserve holdings of these assets reduced privatesector holdings, exerting downward pressure on term premiums and, consequently, keeping longer -term interest rates and overall financial conditions more accommodative than they otherwise would be."
"   In their discussion of considerations related to asset purchases, various participants noted that these purchases were an important part of the monetary policy toolkit and a critical aspect of the Federal Reserve’s response to the economic effects of the pandemic, supporting smooth financial market functioning and accommodative financial conditions, which aided the flow of credit to households and businesses and supported  the recovery."
 Participants  discussed a broad range of labor market and inflation indi cators .
 All participants assessed  that the economy had made progress toward the Committee’s maximum -employment and pricestability goal s since the adoption of the guidance on asset purchases in December .
 Most participants judged that the Committee’s standard of “substantial further progress” toward the maximum -employment goal had not yet been met.
" A few  participants  noted, however, that the transitory nature of this year’s rise in inflation, as well as the recent declines in longerterm yields and in market-based measures of inflation compensation, cast doubt on the degree of progress that had been made toward the pr icestability goal since December."
" Looking ahead, most participants noted that, provided that the economy were to evolve broadly as they anticipated, they judged that it could be appropriate  to start reducing the pace of asset purchases this year  because they saw the Committee’s “substantial further progress” criterion as satisfied with respect to the pricestability goal and as  close to being satisfied with respect to the maximum -employment goal ."
" These participants observed that such an approach would be consistent with the Committee’s understanding that purchases of Treasury securities and agency MBS had similar effects on broader financial conditions and played similar roles in the transmission of monetary policy, or that these purchases were not intended as credit allocation."
 A few participants suggested that the Committee would need to be mindful of the risk that a tapering ann ouncement that was perceived to be premature could bring into question the Committee’s commitment to its new monetary policy framework.
" Indicators of labor market conditions were mixed in June, though labor demand remained strong."
" Consumer price inflation through May —as measured by the 12 -month percentage change in the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index —had picked up notably, largely reflecting transitory factors."
" Total  nonfarm payroll employment rose sharply in June, with job gains widespread across industries and especially strong job growth in the leisure and hospitality sector."
" As of June, total payroll employment had retraced _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of July 27–28, 2021Page 5 more than twothirds of the losses seen  at the onset of the pandemic."
" The unemployment rate edged higher and stood at 5.9  percent  in June, and the unemployment rates for African Americans and Hispanics remained well above the national average."
 The labor force participation rate and employmentto-population ratio were unchanged in June.
" Initial claims for regular state unemployment insurance were little changed, on net, since mid -June."
 Weekly estimates of private -sector payrolls constructed by Federal Reserve Board staff using data provided by the payroll processor ADP that were available through the first part of July suggested that the pace of private employment gains had remained strong.
 Recent monthly increases in average hourly earnings appeared to reflect a combination of strong labor demand and increased di fficulties in hiring that had more than offset the downward pressure on average earnings from disproportionately large employment gains in lower -wage industries.
" Information from compensation measures that were judged to be less affected by shifts in the composition of the workforce was mixed:  A staff measure of the 12 -month change in the median wage derived from the ADP data had stepped up noticeably in June relative to  earlier in the year ; by contrast, the Wage Growth Tracker measure constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta had not shown a similar pickup."
" Recent 12 -month change measures of inflation, using either PCE prices or the consumer price index (CPI), had been boosted by base effects as the extremely low inflation readings from the spring of 2020 rolled out of the calculation."
" In addition, a surge in demand as  the economy reopened further, combined with production bottlenecks and supply constraints, had pushed up recent monthly price increases."
" Total PCE price inflation was 3.9 percent  over the 12 months ending in May, and core PCE price inflation, which excludes  changes in consumer energy prices and many consumer food prices, was 3.4 percent over the 12 months ending in May."
" In contrast, the trimmed mean measure of  12month PC E inflation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas was 1.9 percent  in May."
" In the second quarter of 2021, the staff’s common inflation expectations index, which combines information from many indicators of inflation expectations  and inflation compensation, had more than reversed the moderate decline recorded in the middle of last year and had returned to the level that prevailed in 2014, when actual inflation was relatively modest."
" Even so, consumer spending appeared to have been held back some as producers struggled to meet demand."
" Similarly, despite very strong demand for housing, incoming data suggested that residential investment spending had declined in the second quarter as materials shortages and limited stocks of homes for sale temporarily restrained activity in that sector."
" Available in dicators suggested that growth in business fixed investment had slowed sharply in the second quarter, reflecting disruptions to motor vehicle production and aircraft deliveries and a faster rate of decline in nonresidential structures investment."
 Growth in manufacturing output had picked up modestly in the second quarter.
 The nominal U.S. international trade deficit remained high in May.
"Page 6Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ Incoming data suggested that, after a weak start to the year, foreign economic activity accelerated in the second quarter."
" Inflation rose further in most foreign economies, reflecting a reversal of price declines seen in the spring of 2020, higher energy and commodity prices, and supply bottlenecks."
"  Staff Review of the Financial Situation  Over the intermeeting period, fluctuations in financial markets appeared to be driven by less -accommodative -thanexpected June FOMC communications, a reduction in investor perceptions of the risk of persistently high inflation, increased concerns about the rapid spread of the Delta variant, and stronger -thananticipated inflation data."
" Longer -dated Treasury yields fell, largely reflecting declines in real yields, while longer -horizon forward measures of inflation compensation also declined."
" The decline in longer -term Treasury yields was associated with a drop in real yields implied by Treasury Inflation -Protecte d Securities ( TIPS) , with the 10 -year real yield down about 25 basis points."
" Meanwhile, shorter -horizon measures of inflation compensation ended the period modestly higher, but longer -term forward measures fell notably."
" Following the actions at the June FOMC meeting to increase both the interest rate on excess reserves and the ON RRP rate by 5 basis points, the effective federal funds rate rose 4 basis points , reaching 10 basis points, while the Secured Overnight Financing Rate rose 4 basis points , reaching 5 basis points."
" In  emerging markets, the central banks of Brazil and Mexico raised rates in order to reduce inflationary pressures."
" In contrast, the People’s Bank of China cut the broad reserve requirement ratio for banks to support  economic growth."
" The European Central Bank completed its strategy review, adopting a 2  percent  symmetric inflation target, and revised forward guidance on its policy rate."
" Banks surveyed in the July SLOOS reported that demand for C&I loans had improved over the second quarter; however, market commentary suggested that demand was still generally weak."
" Financing conditions facing small businesses remained relatively tight, and their loan demand was generally weak."
 CRE loan growth at banks remained weak in the second quarter in comparison with prepandemic levels.
" Consumer credit jumped in May and remained strong in June, reflecting a rebound in credit card balances and continued robust growth in auto loans."
 Banks in the July SLOOS reported stronger demand and easier standards for both credit cards and auto loans over the second quarter.
" That said, the  staff did not see signs of loose mortgage underwriting standards or excessive credit growth that could potentially amplify a shock arising from falling house prices."
"Staff Economic Outlook  The projection for U.S. economic activity prepared by the staff for the July FOMC meeting was little changed , on balance,  from the June  forecast."
" In the second half of 2021, an easing of the surge in demand seen over the first part of the year was expected to be largely offset by a reduction in the effects of supply constraints on production, thereby allowing real GDP growth to continue at a rapid pace."
" For the year as a whole, therefore, real GDP was projected to post a substantial increase, with a correspondingly large decline in the unemployment rate."
" With the boost to spending growth from continued reductions in social distancing assumed to fade after 2021 and with a further unwinding of the effects of fiscal stimulus, GDP growth was expected to step down in 2022 and 2023."
" However, with monetary policy assumed to remain highly accommodative, the staff continued to anticipate that real GDP growth would outpace growth in potential output over most of this period, leading to a decline in the unemployment rate to historically low levels."
"The staff’s near -term outlook for inflation was revised up further in response to incoming data, but the staff continued to expect that this year’s rise in inflation would prove to be transitory."
" The 12month change in total and core PCE prices was well above 2  percent in May, and available data suggested that PCE price inflation would remain high in June."
 The staff continued to judge that the surge in demand that had resulted as the economy reopened further had combined  with production bottlenecks and supply constraints to boost recent monthly inflation rates.
" The staff expected the 12month change in PCE prices to move down gradually over the second part of 2021, reflecting an anticipated moderation in monthly inflation rates and the waning of base effects ; even so, PCE price inflation was projected to be running well above 2  percent  at the end of the year."
" Over the following year, the boost to consumer prices caused by supply issues was expected to partly reverse, and import prices were expected to decelerate sharply; as a result, PCE price inflation was expected to step down to a little below 2  percent  in 2022 before additional increases in resource utilization raised it to 2  percent in 2023."
 The staff continued to judge that the risks to the baseline projection for economic activity were skewed to the downside and that the uncertai nty around the forecast was elevated.
" However, the staff judged that the risks around the inflation projection were now tilted to the upside, as recent data pointed to a greater risk that the upward pressure on inflation that had resulted from supplyrelated issues would unwind more slowly than the staff’s baseline projection assumed ."
"Participants’ Views on Current Economic Conditions and the Economic Outlook  In their discussion of current conditions, participants noted that, with progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment had continued to strengthen."
" Inflation had risen, largely reflecting transitory factors."
 Participants observed that economic activity continued to expand at a rapid pace through the middl e of the year even though capacity constraints were restraining the increase in output in some sectors.
" Economic growth was expected to remain strong over the second half of the year, supported by the further reopening of the economy, accommodative financial conditions, and easing of supply constraints."
" In their discussion of the household sector, participants remarked th at consumer spending had continued to increase at a very rapid pace, supported by the ongoing reopening of the economy along with the accommodation provided by fiscal policy and monetary policy."
 Participants generally expected housing demand to remain strong but noted that construction had  been restrained by shortages of materials and other inputs and that home sales had been held back by limited supplies of available homes.
" Participants noted that growth in manufacturing activity continued to be solid  but was restrained by production bottlenecks and supply constraints, particularly in the motor vehicle sector."
" Citing reports received from contacts in a broad range of industries, participants indicated that shortages of materials and labor as well as s upply chain challenges remained widespread and continued to limit the ability of firms to keep up with strong demand."
" Even though their outlook for demand had improved further, many business contacts had expressed uncertainty and pessimism over prospects regarding the easing of supply constraints over the near term."
 Participants commented on the continued improvement in labor market conditions in recent months driven by strong demand for workers.
" T he monthly pace of job gains had picked up, with employment expanding 850,000 in June and with notable increases in the l eisure and hospitality sector."
" Nevertheless, t he household survey showed that the unemployment rate remained elevated at 5.9  percent  in June, and the labor force participation rate and employment -topopulation ratio w ere little changed  in recent months."
 Participants indicated that the economy had not yet achieved the Committee’s broad -based and inclusive maximum -employment goal.
" Participants generally noted that supplyside factors related to the pandemic—such as caregiving needs, ongoing fears of the virus, increased retirements , and expanded unemployment insurance payments —continued to weigh on labor force partici pation and employment growth."
" Page 10Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ In their discussion  of inflation, participants observed that the inflation rate had increased notably and expected that it would likely remain elevated in coming months before moderating."
 Participants remarked that inflation had increased generally more than expected this year and  attributed this increase to supply constraints in product and labor markets and a surge in consumer demand as the economy reopened.
 Many participants pointed out that the largest contributors to recent increases in measures of inflation were a handful of sectors most affected by temporary supply bottlenecks or sectors in which price levels were rebounding from depressed levels as the economy continued to reopen.
" Looking ahead, while participants generally expected inflation pressures to ease as the effect of these transitory factors dissipated, several participants remarked that larger -thananticipated supply  chain disruptions  and increases in input costs could sustain upward pressure on prices into 2022."
" In their comments on  inflation expectations, some participants noted that measures of longer -term inflation expectations had remain ed in ranges that were viewed as broadly consistent with the Committee’s longer -run inflation goal."
 S everal  participants indicated that the recent increases in surveybased measures  signaled  a risk that longer -term inflation expectations might be moving up above levels consistent with the Committee’s goals .
 Other participants pointed to the substantial decline in TIPS -based longer -term inflation compensation since June as suggesting that investors perceived reduced risks that inflation could run persistently above the Committee’s 2 percent  goal.
 A couple of participants noted that recent readings on forward inflation compensation could be read as suggesting investor concern that inflation ove r the longer term could run persistently below the Committee’s 2  percent  inflation goal.
 Some participants noted that there were upside risks to inflation associat ed with concerns that supply disruptions and labor shortages might linger for longer than currently anticipated and might have larger or more persistent effects on prices and wages than they currently assumed.
" A few participants highlighted scenarios  in which a prolonged period of low interest rates and broadly elevated asset valuations could generate imbalances, which could  increase financial stability risks."
 Some participants commented on the housing market and noted that ongoing rapid house price increases reflected both demand and supply factors.
" In their consideration of the stance of monetary policy, participants reaffirmed the Federal Reserve’s commitment to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy during this challenging time, thereby promoting the Committee’s statutory goals of maximum employment and price stability."
 Participants judged that the current stance of monetary policy remained appropriate to promote maximum employment as well as to achieve inflation that averages 2  percent over time and longer -term inflation expectations that are well anchored at 2 percent .
 Participants also reiterated that the existing outcome -based guidance implied that the paths of the federal funds rate and the balance sheet would depend on actual progress toward reaching the Committee’s maximumemployment and inflation goals.
" They gener ally judged that the Committee’s standard of “substantial further progress” toward the maximum -employment and inflation goals had not yet been met, particularly with respect to labor market conditions, and that risks to _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of July 27–28, 2021Page 11 the economic outlook remained."
" With regard to the labor market, participants noted that the demand for workers had been strong in recent months, while the level of employment had been constrained by labor supply shortages and hiring difficulties."
" Several participants emphasized that employment remained well below its prepandemic level and that a robust labor market, supported by a continuation of accommodative monetary policy, would allow further progress toward the Committee’s broad and inclusive maximumemployment goal and a return over time to labor market conditions as strong as those prevailing before the pan demic ."
 A few other participants judged that monetary policy had limited ability to address the labor supply shortages and hiring difficulties currently constraining the level  of employment.
 Several participants also commented that the pandemic might have caused longer -lasting changes in the labor market and that the prepandemic labor market conditions may not be the right benchmark against which the Committee should assess the progress toward its maximumemployment objective.
"  With regard to inflation, participants commented that recent inflation readings had been boosted by the effects of supply bottlenecks and labor shortages and were likely to be transitory."
" A few participants noted that, while the specific results depended on the period  used in the calculation, some  measures of average inflation were already moving above, or would soon move above, the Committee’s 2  percent  goal, supported by strong demand, a tight labor market, and firming inflation expectations."
 Some other participants emphasized that recent high inflation readings had largely been driven by price increases in a handful of categories.
 These participants pointed out that there was no evidence of broad -based price pressures or of inappropriately high longer -term inflation expectations.
" Several participants also commented that price increases concentrated in a small number of categories were unlikely to change underlying inflation dynamics sufficiently to overcome the possibility  of a persistent downward bias in inflation, as might be associated with the effective lower bound on the policy rate."
" Some participants suggested  that it would be prudent for the Committee to prepare for starting to reduce its pace of asset purchases relatively soon , in light  of the risk that the recent high inflation readings could prove to be more persistent than they had anticipated and because an earlier start to reducing asset purchases would most likely enable additions to securities holdings  to be concluded before the Commit tee judged it appropriate to raise the federal funds rate."
" Several participants also remained concerned about the medium -term outlook for inflation and the possibility of the reemergence of significant downward pressure on inflation, especially in light of the recent decline in longer -term inflation compensation."
" In addition, several participants emphasized that there was considerable uncertainty about the likely resolution of the  labor market shortages and supply bottlenecks and about the i nfluence of pandemicrelated developments on longer -run labor market and inflation dynamics."
   Some participants emphasized that a decision to reduce the Committee’s pace of asset purchases once the “substantial further progress” benchmark had been achieved would be fully consistent with the Committee’s new monetary policy framework and would help foster the achievement of the Committee’s longer -run objectives over time.
 A couple of participants also noted that a tapering of asset purchases did not amount to a tightening of the stance of monetary policy and instead only implied that additional monetary accommodation would be provided at a slower rate.
"  Committee Policy Action  In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that with progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment had continued to strengthen."
" Inflation had risen, largely reflecting transitory factors."
" Members agreed that the Federal Reserve was committed to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximumemployment and pricestability goals."
" All members reaffirmed that, in accordance with the Committee’s goals to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2  percent over the longer run and with inflation having run persistently below this longerrun goal, they would aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2  percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer -term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2  percent ."
 Members expected to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until those outcomes were achieved.
" All members agreed to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼  percent , and they expected that it would be appropriate to maintain this target range until lab or market conditions had reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessments of maximum employment and inflation had risen to 2  percent  and was on track to moderately exceed 2  percent  for some time."
" Last December, the Committee indicated that it would continue to increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and agency mortgagebacked securities by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress had been made toward its maximumemployment and pricestability goals."
" Members agreed that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and that they would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate in the event that risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals."
" Members also concurred that, in assessing the ap propriate stance of monetary policy, they would take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments."
" • Engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve ’s agency MBS transactions.”  The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2:00  p.m.: “The Federal Reserve is committed to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum employment and price stability goals."
" With progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have continued to strengthen."
" Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors."
 The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2  percent  over the longer run.
" With inflation having run persistently below this longer -run goal, the Committee will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2  percent  for some time so that inflation averages 2  percent  over time and longer -term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2  percent ."
 The Committee expects to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomes are achieved.
 The Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0  to ¼ percent  and expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent wi th the Committee’s assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2  percent  and is on track to moderately exceed 2  percent for some time.
" Last December, the Committee indicated that it would continue to increase its holdings of Treasury secu rities by at least $80  billion per month and of agency mortgagebacked securities by at least $40  billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward its maximum employment and price stability goals."
" In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor Page 14Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook."
  The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals.
" The Committee’s assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments."
" Consistent with the Committee’s decision to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the Board  voted unanimously to establish the interest rate paid on res erve balances at 0.15 percent, effective July 29, 2021.5  The Board also voted unanimously to approve establishment of the primary credit rate at the existing level of 0.25 percent , effective Ju ly 29, 2021."
