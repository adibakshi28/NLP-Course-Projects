 The Desk’s overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) operations continued to provide a soft floor for money market interest rates.
  The staff next summarized some of the recent steps the System had taken to prepare further for the process of normalization of monetary policy.
" The staff also proposed that future changes in the FOMC’s target federal funds rate range as well as associated changes in related administered interest rates —including the interest rates on excess and required reserves, the ON RRP rate, and the primary credit rate —all be effective on the day after the Committee’ s policy decision."
" Participants generally favored continuing reinvestments during the early stages of normalization, initially using only increases in the target range for the federal funds rate to reduce monetary policy accommodation."
 This approach was viewed as consistent with the Committee’s plans to rely on changes in the target range for the federal funds rate as the primary indicator of the stance of monetary policy.
"  Participants unanimously supported the addition of medians for all variables —economic growth, the unemployment rate, total and core inflation, and individual assessments of the projected appropriate federal funds rate —to the September SEP and the removal of the histogram of preferred liftoff years following the commencement of normalization."
" Consumer price inflation continued to run below the FOMC’s longer -run objective of 2 percent, restrained by earlier declines in energy prices and further decreases in nonenergy import prices."
" Survey measures of longerterm inflation expectations remained stable, while marketbased measures of inflation compensation were still low."
"Minutes of the Meeting of July 28–29, 2015Page 3_____________________________________________________________________________________________Total nonfarm payroll employment continued to expand at a solid pace in June."
" The unemployment rate declined to 5.3 percent, its lowest reading so far this year, and the share of workers employed part time edged lower; however, the labor force participation rate and the employment- topopulation ratio both moved down."
"After narrowing in April, the U.S. international trade deficit widened in May, as exports decreased more than imports."
" While real net exports made a large negative contribution to the change in real GDP in the first quarter of 2015, the available trade data indicated that the drag on GDP growth exerted by net exports in the second quarter was considerably smaller."
" Core PCE inflation, which excludes food and energy prices, was 1¼ percent over the same period, restrained in part by declines in the prices of nonenergy imports."
"  Measures of expected longerrun inflation from a variety of surveys, including the Michigan survey Page 4Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________and the Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers, remained stable."
" However, marketbased measures of inflation compensation were still low, although they were somewhat higher than early in the year."
Foreign economic growth appeared to remain subdued in the second quarter.
 Economic activity also weakened in some Latin American countries.
" By contrast, secondquarter economic growth was strong in China and in the United Kingdom, and euroarea indicators were consistent with continued moderate economic expansion."
" Headline foreign inflation remained low, importantly reflecting past oil price declines."
" Federal Reserve communications and economic data releases, including the June employment report and retail sales data, put some downward pressure on the path of expected future shortterm interest rates."
" On net, 5year and 10year Treasury yields were somewhat lower, measures of inflation compensation over the next 5 years based on Treasury InflationProtected Securities declined, equity prices were little changed, and the foreign exchange value of the dollar rose modestly."
"    Marketbased measures of inflation compensation over the next 5 years moved lower amid a decline in oil prices, whereas inflation compensation 5 to 10 years ahead was relatively stable."
" CRE loans on banks’ books expanded in the second quarter, consistent with stronger loan demand reported in the July Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS)."
" Interest rates on 30year fixedrate mortgages were little changed, in line with MBS yields and other longerterm interest rates."
"Sovereign bond yields and monetary policy expectations in the United Kingdom changed little, on net, over the intermeeting period."
" By contrast, yields in Canada, New Zealand, Norway, and Sweden decreased following weakerthan-expected macroeconomic data releases and additional monetary policy accommodation."
" Real GDP was again expected to increase faster in the second half of this year than in the first half and to expand more rapidly than potential output in 2016 and 2017, even as the normalization of the stance of monetary policy was assumed to proceed."
" However, real GDP growth over the medium term was revised down a small amount, in part because of a slightly stronger forecast for the exchange value of the dollar."
" First, the projected rates of productivity gains and potential output growth over the medium term were trimmed."
" With actual and potential GDP growth both a bit weaker, the projected narrowing of the output gap over the medium term was little revised."
" Second, the staff lowered slightly its estimate of the longerrun natural rate of unemployment."
 The unemployment rate was expected to decline gradually to this revised estimate.
"The staff’s forecast for inflation was revised down, particularly in the near term, as the decline in crude oil prices over the intermeeting period was expected to result in lower consumer energy prices."
" Although energy prices and nonoil import prices were expected to begin rising steadily next year, the staff continued to project that inflation would be below the Committee’s longer -run objective of 2 percent over 2016 and 2017."
" Inflation was anticipated to move up gradually to 2 percent thereafter, with inflation expectations in the longer run assumed to be consistent with the Committee’s objective and slack in labor and product markets projected to have waned."
"The staff viewed the uncertainty around its July projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as similar to the average of the past 20 years."
" The risks to the forecast for real GDP and inflation were seen as tilted to the downside, reflecting the staff’s assessment that neither monetary nor fiscal policy was well positioned to help the economy withstand substantial adverse shocks."
" At the same time, the staff viewed the risks around its outlook for the unemployment rate as roughly balanced."
"Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook  In their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants viewed the information received over the intermeeting period as suggesting that economic activity had been expanding moderately in recent months."
" The pace of job gains had been solid and the unemployment rate had declined, with a range of labor market indicators suggesting that underutilization of labor resources had continued to diminish."
" Participants generally viewed the incoming data as confirming their earlier assessment that the weak report on real GDP in Page 6Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________the first quarter reflected transitory factors and expected that real economic activity would continue to expand at a moderate pace over the balance of the year , leading to further improvement in labor market conditions."
" However, a few participants observed that although GDP growth appeared to have picked up in recent months relative to the firstquarter pace, the level of GDP remained lower than had been projected earlier in the year."
" Inflation continued to run below the Committee’s  2 percent longerrun objective, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and further decreases in prices of nonenergy imports."
" Marketbased measures of inflation compensation remained low, while surveybased measures of longerterm inflation expectations remained stable."
 Participants generally anticipated that inflation would rise gradually toward 2 percent as the labor market improved further and the transitory effects of earlier declines in energy and import prices dissipated.
" Although many continued to see some downside risks arising from economic and financial developments abroad , participants generally viewed the risks to the outlook for domestic economic activity and the labor market as nearly balanced."
" Continued gains in employment and income, high household net worth, and low gasoline prices were viewed as factors that should support consumer spending in coming months."
" Consumer credit conditions were also seen as favorable, with business contacts pointing to steady loan growth, especially for auto loans and credit cards."
" However, a couple of participants noted that they did not expect this sector to be a major contributor to economic growth over the remainder of the year."
" In addition, government spending was expected to add very little to growth in aggregate spending this year."
" Participants also expected net exports to continue to subtract from GDP growth over the second half of the year, reflecting in part the damping influence of the dollar’s  earlier appreciation."
" Those firms connected to the auto, aerospace, and construction industries, for example, reported strong demand."
" Overall, most contacts viewed the recent slowdown in manufacturing as likely to prove temporary and remained optimistic about future demand, even though the recent decreases in oil prices and the possibility of adverse spillovers from slower economic growth in China raised some concerns."
" While the recent Chinese stock market decline seemed to have had limited implications to date for the growth outlook in China , several participants noted that a material slowdown in Chinese economic activity could pose risks to the U.S. economic outlook."
" S ome participants also discussed the risk that a possible divergence in interest rates in the United States and abroad might lead to further Minutes of the Meeting of July 28–29, 2015Page 7_____________________________________________________________________________________________appreciation of the dollar, extending the downward pressure on commodity prices and the weakness in net exports."
"Participants agreed that labor market conditions had improved further , citing increases in payroll employment and job openings, the decrease in the unemployment rate, and some further reduction in broader measures of labor market underutilization."
The ongoing rise in labor demand still appeared not to have led to a broadbased firming of wage increases.
" The most recent employment cost index, released in April, had suggested an increase in wage gains."
" In addition, it was noted that considerable uncertainty remained about when wages might begin to accelerat e and whether that development might translate into increased price inflation."
Participants discussed how recent developments influenced their expectations for reaching the FOMC’s  2 percent inflation objective over the medium term.
 Total PCE inflation conti nued to run below the Committee’ s longerrun objective.
" Core PCE price inflation, as measured on a 12month change basis, also remained low, but other measures, such as the trimmed mean PCE and median CPI, continued to run at higher levels than core PCE inflation."
" Moreover, core CPI inflation had picked up over recent months."
"  Some participants cited downside risks to inflation , pointing to the absence of any noticeable response of inflation to the reduction in resource slack over the past several years, risks of further declines in oil and commodity prices, and the possibility of further appreciation in the dollar."
" Although most readings on longerterm inflation expectations were little changed recently, participants discussed how to interpret downward movements in some survey and marketbased measures of inflation expectations over the past few years."
 Most participants still expected that the downward pressure on inflation from the previous declines in energy prices and the effects of past dollar appreciation would prove to be temporary.
" Participants generally continued to anticipate that, with appropriate monetary policy, inflation would move up to the Committee’s  objective over the medium term, reflecting the anticipated tightening of product and labor markets and stable longerterm inflation expectations."
 Participants also noted the challenges associated with identifying newly emerging risks as well as the implications for monetary policy of a hypothetical future situation in which financial imbalances were increasing.
"During their discussion of economic conditions and monetary policy, participants mentioned a number of considerations associated with the timing and pace of policy normalization."
"  Many participants indicated that their outlook for sustained economic growth and further improvement in labor markets was key in supporting their expectation that inflation would move up to the Committee’s  2 percent objective, and that they would be looking for evidence that the economic outlook was evolving as they anticipated."
" However, some Page 8Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________participants expressed the view that the incoming information had not yet provided grounds for reasonable confidence that inflation would move back to 2 percent over the medium term and that the inflation outlook thus might not soon meet one of the conditions established by the Committee for initiating a firming of policy."
 Several of these participants cited evidence that the response of inflation to the elimination of resource slack might be attenuated and expressed concern about risks of further downward pressure on inflation from international developments.
 Another concern related to the risk of premature policy tightening was the limited ability of monetary policy to offset downside shocks to inflation and economic activity when the federal funds rate was near its effective lower bound.
" A few of these participants judged that the stance of monetary policy, including the extraordinarily low level of the federal funds rate and the current size of the Federal Reserve balance sheet, was very accommodative."
 A couple of others thought that an appreciable delay in beginning the process of normalization might result in an undesirable increase in inflation or have adverse consequences for financial stability.
"  While monetary policy adjustments ultimately would be data dependent, some participants expressed the view that, in light of their current outlook, it likely would be appropriate to adjust the federal funds rate gradually after the first increase to help ensure that the economy would be able to absorb higher interest rates and that inflation was moving toward the Committee’s objective."
" Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead , members judged that information received since the FOMC met in June indicated that economic activity had been expanding moderately in recent months."
" The labor market had also continued to improve, with solid job gains and declining unemployment."
" Members generally viewed these developments, together with appropriate monetary policy accommodation, as supporting their expectations for moderate economic growth in the medium term and for further improvement in labor market conditions."
 They also continued to see the risks to the outlook for economic activity and the labor market as nearly balanced.
" Inflation had continued to run below the Committee’s  longerrun objective, but members expected it to rise gradually toward 2 percent over the medium term as the labor market improved further and the transitory effects of earlier declines in energy and import prices dissipated."
"In assessing whether economic conditions had improved sufficiently to initiate a firming in the stance of monetary policy, the Committee noted that, on balance, a range of labor market indicators suggested that underutilization of labor resources had diminished further."
" Most members saw room for some additional progress in reducing labor market slack, although several viewed current labor market conditions as at or very close to those consistent with maximum employment."
 Many members thought that labor market underutilization would be largely eliminated in the near term if economic activity evolved as they expected.
" However, several were concerned that labor market conditions consistent with maximum employment could take longer to achieve , noting, for example, the lack of convincing signs of accelerating wages, which might be signaling that the natural rate of unemployment could currently be lower than they previously thought."
"In considering the Committee’s  criteria with respect to inflation for beginning policy normalization, most members viewed the incoming data as reinforcing their earlier assessment that, although inflation continued to run below the Committee’s objective,  the downward pressure on inflation from the previous decreases in energy prices and the effects of past dollar appreciation would abate."
" Minutes of the Meeting of July 28–29, 2015Page 9_____________________________________________________________________________________________However, core inflation on a yearover- year basis also was still below 2 percent."
" Moreover, some members continued to see downside risks to inflation from the possibility of further dollar appreciation and declines in commodity prices."
" In addition, several members noted that higher rates of resource utilization appeared to have had only very limited effects to date on wages and prices , and underscored the uncertainty surrounding the inflation process as well as the role and dynamics of inflation expectations."
" The Committee agreed to continue to monitor inflation developments closely, with almost all members indicating that they would need to see more evidence that economic growth was sufficiently strong and labor markets conditions had firmed enough for them to feel reasonably confident that inflation would return to the Committee’s  longerrun objective over the medium term."
" The Committee updated the statement to indicate that economic activity had been expanding moderately in recent months and that it had seen further improvement in labor market conditions over the intermeeting period, pointing specifically to solid job gai ns and declining unemployment."
 The Committee also modified the discussion of inflation developments slightly to recognize the more recent declines in energy prices while restating the expectation that inflation would rise gradually toward 2 percent over the medium term as the labor market improved further and the transitory effects of earlier declines in energy and import prices dissipated.
The Committee agreed to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and to reaffirm in the statement that the Committee’s  decision about how long to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate would depend on its assessment of actual and expected progress toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.
" Members also agreed that their evaluation of progress on their objectives would take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developmen ts."
" Specifically, members agreed to indicate the Committee’s anticipation that it would be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate when it has seen some further improvement in the labor market and is reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term."
" The Committee reiterated  its expectation that, even after employment and inflation are near mandateconsistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run."
"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: “Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster maximum employment and price stability."
 The System Open Market Account manager and the secretary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the System’s balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the Committee’s objectives of maximum employment and price stability.”  The vote encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p.m.: “Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in June indicates that economic activity has been expanding moderately in recent months.
" Growth in household spending has been moderate and the housing sector has shown additional improvement; however, business fixed investment and net exports stayed soft."
" The labor market continued to improve, with solid job gains and declining unemployment."
" Inflation continued to run below the Commit tee’s longer -run objective, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and decreasing prices of nonen-ergy imports."
 Marketbased measures of inflation compensation remain low; surveybased measures of longerterm inflation expectations have remained stable.
"Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
" The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, with labor market indicators continuing to move toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate."
 The Committee continues to see the risks to the outlook for economic activity and the labor market as nearly balanced.
" Inflation is anticipated to remain near its recent low level in the near term, but the Committee expects inflation to rise gradually toward 2 percent over the medium term as the labor market improves further and the transitory effects of earlier declines in energy and import prices dissipate."
 The Committee continues to monitor inflation developments closely.
"To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee today reaffirmed its view that the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate remains appropriate."
" In determining how long to maintain this target range, the Committee will assess progress —both realized and expected —toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation."
" This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
 The Committee anticipates that it will be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate when it has seen some further improvement in the labor market and is reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term.
"When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longerrun goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent."
" The Committee currently anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near mandateconsistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run.”   Minutes of the Meeting of July 28–29, 2015Page 11_____________________________________________________________________________________________Voting for this action:   Janet L."
"LongRun Monetary Policy Implementation Framework At the conclusion of the meeting, the Chair noted that the staff would soon begin an extended effort to evaluate potential longrun monetary policy implementation frameworks."
" In view of the likely time frames for normalization of the stance of monetary policy and the System’s balance sheet, the Committee probably would not need to reach any final decisions regarding such a framework for several years."
" However, in light of experience over recent years, policymakers agreed that a number of related issues warranted attention, including topics such as the effectiveness of alternative implementation frameworks in scenarios that could require a return to the zero lower bound , regulatory and other structural developments that could affect financial institutions and markets in ways that would affect monetary policy implementation, and the longrun structure of the Federal Reserve’s assets and liabilities that best supports the System’s macroeconomic objectives and financial stability."
" In discussing the range of issues contemplated for study under this project, it was noted that the Policy Normalization Principles and Plans reflect the Committee’s intention that, in the longer run, the Federal Reserve will hold no more securities than necessary to implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively and that the Federal Reserve will hold primarily Treasury securities."
"Policymakers agreed that it would be important to draw on the perspectives of staff across the Federal Reserve System and to consult widely with other central banks, academics, and other experts on markets, financial institutions, and monetary policy."
