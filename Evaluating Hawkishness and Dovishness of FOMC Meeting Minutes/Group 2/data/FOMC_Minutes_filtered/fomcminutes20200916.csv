 That ability made a real difference in the conduct and communication of monetary policy.
" From his work on r* , to the balance sheet, to leading the steering committee for our monetary policy review, Thomas Laubach’s intellectual fingerprints are all over the Committee’s decisions that will define this era of the Federal Reserve."
" Ironically, given subsequent events, the question of the time was whether the productivity boom had driven r* higher."
" His book on inflation targeting with Ben Bernanke, Rick Mishkin, and Adam Posen is a classic reference on the subject, as is his work with President Williams on r*."
" Thomas of course never lost that spark and joy for the practice of monetary policy, and we are all fortunate that he did not."
" I understand that in Thomas’s last days, he was able to watch the Chair’s speech  at Jackson Hole rolling out the new framework, and that he was so proud to have been part of what the Wall Street Journal  called a landmark change in U.S. monetary policy."
" Yields on Treasury inflationprotected  securities fell, while  longer -dated nominal Treasury yields increased modestly."
"  Against this backdrop, most respondents to the Open Market Desk ’s Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants perceiv ed downside risks to U.S. gross domestic product ( GDP) growth this year as having declined notably since the July survey, and their forecasts for overall growth for 2020 were revised up significantly ."
" In addition, most forecasters were assuming that an additional pand emicrelated fiscal package would be approved this year, and noted that, absent a new package, growth could decelerate at a faster -thanexpected pace in the fourth quarter."
 The release of the revised Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy (consensus statement) elicited r elatively modest immediate reaction across markets.
" However, market participants generally viewed the completion of the review as an important milestone; many indicated that growing expectations for the Committee to adopt a flexible averageinflation- targeting regime had influenced asset prices over recent months."
" In particular, th ese expectations were  viewed as contributing to the recent rise in far -forward measures of inflation compensation, though market participants noted that these measures were still somewhat low by historical standards."
 Most respondents to the Desk’s surveys continued to indicate that they expected the FOMC  to adopt outcome -based forward guidance linked to inflation; some noted that employment measures could be part of the forward guidance as well.
" Survey respondents’ expectations for the economic conditions that would prevail when the FOMC first lifted the target range had shifted notably since the previous survey, with many respondents projecting somewhat higher inflation and lower unemployment than in July."
 Staff Review of the Economic Situation  The COVID19 pandemic and the measures undertaken to contain its spread continued to affect economic activity in the United States and abroad.
" Labor market conditions continued to improve markedly in July and August, but employment was still below its level at the beginning of the year."
 Consumer price inflation— as measured by the 12month percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) through July—Page 4Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________   remained well below the rates that prevailed early in the year.
"Total nonfarm payroll employment expanded strongly in July and August, although  payrolls had retraced only about half of the jobs lost at the onset of the pandemic."
 The unemployment rate moved down further to 8.4  percent in August.
" The unemployment rates for African Americans, Asians, and Hispanics declined over the past two months but remained well above the national average."
" The labor force participation rate rose, on net, and the employmentto-population ratio increased further in July and August."
" Initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits continued to move down, on net, through early September, but the pace of declines had slowed."
" In addition, weekly estimates of privatesector payrolls constructed by the Board’s staff using data provided by th e payroll processor ADP suggested that employment gains likely were still solid from midAugust to early September."
"Total PCE price inflation was 1.0 percent over the 12 months ending in July, reflecting both weak aggregate demand and a considerable drop i n consumer energy prices early this year."
" Core PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in consumer food and energy prices, was 1.3 percent over the same 12 -month period."
" By comparison, the trimmed mean measure of 12 -month PCE price inflation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas was 1.8 percent in July."
" The consumer price index (CPI) increased 1.3  percent over the 12 months ending in August, while core CPI inflation was 1.7 percent over the same period."
" On a monthly basis, recent inflation readings were bolstered by increases in durable goods prices, largely reflecting the strong demand for consumer goods as household purchases shifted away from many consumer services."
 The latest readings on surveybased measures of longer -run inflation expectations moved up a bit but remained within their ranges in recent years.
 Real PCE expanded strongly in July and continued to be bolstered by supportive fiscal and monetary policy actions.
" Housing -sector activity continued to expand, likely supported by the effects of low interest rates."
" Federal defense spending continued to rise through August, and federal employment was boosted markedly by temporary census -related hiring."
" On net, over these two months, the nominal U.S. international trade deficit widened , as imports rose more than exports."
 Foreign economic activity plunged in the second quarter as a result of the COVID -19 pandemic and the associated restrictive measures to contain it.
" Recent readings of headline and core inflation abroad remained quite low, particularly in the advanced foreign economies (AFEs) , amid subdued demand pressures and lower energy prices from earlier this year."
" Inflation compensation increased  further, reaching prepandemic levels."
" Measures of inflation compensation based on TIPS maturing over the next few years continued to increase, likely reflecting the general improvement in investor sentiment accompanying the improvement in the economic outlook, some further improvements in TIPS market liquidity, and the higher -thanexpected July CPI data release."
 The 5 -year and 5 -to10-year measures of inflation compensation were close to their prepandemic levels but were still in the lower e nd of their historical ranges.
Communications about monetary policy over the intermeeting period generally had little effect on Treasury yields or the expected path of the federal funds rate.
" However, market participants suggested that building expectations that the Committee would move to a form of flexible average inflation targeting under the revised consensus statement had been a factor boosting TIPS inflation compensation over recen t months."
" In contrast, CRE loan growth at banks was weak in July and August, likely partly driven by the recovery of CMBS markets."
" However , offered interest rates rose and credit limits edged down for credit cards to nonprime borrowers."
" Staff Economic Outlook  In the U.S. economic projection prepared by the staff for the September FOMC meeting, the rate of real GDP growth and the pace of declines in the unemployment rate were faster over the second half of this year than in the July forecast, primarily reflecting recent better -thanexpected data."
" In addition, the inflation forecast for the rest of the year was revised up slightly, as some  recent consumer goods prices were stronger than expected."
" Nevertheless, inflation was still projected to be subdued this year, reflecting substantial slack in resource utilization and the sizable declines in consumer energy prices earlier this year."
" Fis cal policy measures, along with the support from monetary policy and the Federal Reserve’s liquidity and lending facilities , were expected to continue supporting  the second -half recovery, although the recovery was forecast to be far from complete by year -end."
"  Altogether , the rate of real GDP growth was projected to exceed potential output growth, the unemployment rate was expected to decline considerably further, and inflation was forecast to pick back up in 2021 through 2023."
"  With the moreaccommodative monetary policy assumed in the current forecast, which reflected the recent consensus statement,  inflation was projected to moderately overshoot 2 percent for some time in the years beyond 2023 ."
" Given the apparent resilience of the U.S. economy to the acceleration in the spread of the pandemic during the summer, the staff judged that a significantly more pessimistic economic outcome, which the staff had previously viewed as no less plausible than the baseline forecast and had featured a renewed downturn in economic activity, was  now less likely than the baseli ne forecast."
"  Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outloo k In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2020 through 2023 and over the longer run, based on their individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy —including the path for the federal funds rate."
" The longer -run projections represented each participant’s assessment of the rate to w hich each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy."
 Economic activity and employment had picked up in recent months but remained well below their levels at the beginning of the year.
 Weaker demand and significantly Page 8Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________   lower oil prices were holding down consumer price inflation.
" Participants agreed that the path of the economy would depend on the course of the virus and that the ongoing public health crisis would continue to weigh on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term and posed considerable r isks to the economy’s mediumterm outlook."
" Participants observed that the incoming data indicated that economic activity was recovering faster than expected from its depressed second -quarter level, when much of the economy was shut down to stem the spread of the virus."
" Prior fiscal policy actions were seen as having supported the ability and willingness of households to spend, although most participants expressed concern about the expiration of the enhanced unemployment insurance benefits from the CARES Act (Coronavirus Aid, Relief,  and Economic Security Act) and judged that additional fiscal relief  would help sustain the recovery in household spending ."
 Particip ants also viewed accommodative monetary policy as contributing to gains in residential investment as well as consu mer purchases of motor vehicles and other durable goods.
 A number of participants judged that low interest rates were supporting business investment.
 The gains in employment over July and August  were generally seen as larger than anticipated.
 Some participants noted that the majority of gains in employment so far reflected workers on temporary layoffs returning to work.
"In their comments about inflation, participants noted that consumer prices had increased more quickly than expected in recent months and that market -based measures of inflation compensation had increased moderately over the intermeeting period , although they remained low."
 The upturn in consumer prices was primarily attributed to price increases in sectors such as consumer durables in which demand had risen after experiencing a large decline earlier this spring .
" Nevertheless, inflation remained subdued, and participants still generally judged that the overall effect of the pandemic on prices was disinflationary."
" While the outlook for inflation was viewed as highly uncertain, a number of participants projected  that inflation would run below the Committee’s 2 percent longer -run objective for a significant period  before moving moderately above 2 percent for some time —consistent with the Committee’s revised consensus statement."
" While these actions as well as prompt and forceful monetary policy measures in response to the pandemic were viewed as contributing to accommodative financial conditions, participants noted important differences in credit quality and credit availability across borrowers."
" Several participants raised concerns regarding the longer -run effects of the pandemic, including how it could lead to a restructuring in some sectors of the economy that could slow employment growth or could accelerate technological disruption that was likely limiting the pricing power of firms ."
"  In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, participants reaffirmed that they were committed to using the Federal Reserve’s full range of tools in order to support the U.S. economy during this challenging time, thereby promoting the Committee’s statutory goals of maximum employment and price stability."
" They also noted that the path of the economy would depend significantly on the course of the virus and that the ongoing public health crisis would continue to weigh on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term and posed considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term."
 Page 10Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________   All participants agreed that the completion of the framework review and the publication of  the revised consensus statement provided a strong foundation for monetary policy decisions and communications going forward.
" In particular, participants reiterated their commitment to achieve maximum employment and an inflation rate of 2 percent over the longer run."
" With inflation running  persistently below its longerrun goal, participants judged that it would be appropriate to aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation would average 2 percent over time and longer -term inflation expectations would remain well anchored at 2  percent."
 Most participants supported providing more explicit  outcome -based forward guidance for the federal funds rate that included establishing criteria for lifting the federal funds rate above the ELB in terms of the paths for employment or  inflation  or both.
" Among the participants who favored providing more explicit forward guidance at this meeting, all but a couple supported a formulation in which the forward guidance included language indicating that it would likely be appropriate to maintain the current target range until labor market conditions were judged to be consistent with the Committee’s assessments of maximum employment and inflation had risen to 2 percent and was on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time."
  Information pointing to a weaker outlook for the economy and inflation would tend to lead to public expectations for a longer period at the current setting of the target range while information suggesting a stronger outlook for the economy and inflation would tend to lead to expectations for a shorter period at the current setting .
" In particular, these participants preferred forward guidance in which the target range for the federal funds rate remained at the ELB until inflation had moved above 2 percent for some time."
" Especially in light of the lengthy period in which inflation has run below the Committee’s longer -run 2 percent objective, these participants judged that it was critical to demonstrate the Committee’s commitment to achieve outcomes in which inflation averages 2 percent over time."
" However, with long erterm interest rates already very low, there did not appear to be a need for  enhanced forward guidance at this juncture or much scope for forward guidance to put additional  downward pressure on yields ."
" Moreover,  these  participants  were concerned that forward guidance that involved the target range for the federal funds rate remaining at the ELB until employment and inflation criteria were achieved could limit the Committee’ s flexibility for years ."
" Furthermore, by influencing expectations  for the path of short -term interest rates , such guidance could  contribute to a buildup of financial imbalances that would make it more difficult for the Committee to achieve its objectives in the future."
 Some participa nts also noted that in future meetings it would be appropriate to further assess and communicate how the Committee’s asset purchase program could best support the achieve ment of the Committee’s  maximumemployment and price -stability goals.
" Committee Pol icy Action  In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that the COVID -19 pandemic was causing tremendous human and economic hardship across the United States and around the world."
" They noted that economic activity and employment had picked up in recent months but remained well below their levels at the beginning of the year, and that weaker demand and significantly lower oil prices were holding down consumer price inflation."
" Members agreed that the Federal Reserve was committed to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challeng ing time, thereby promoting its maximum -employment and price -stability goals."
" In addition, members agreed that the ongoing public health crisis would continue to weigh on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term and was posing considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term."
 All members agreed to incorporate into the postmeeting statement key elements of the Committee’s revised Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy.
" Accordingly, members agreed that the FOMC statement should note that the Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run and that, with inflation running persistently below this longer -run goal, the Committee will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer -term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent."
" To this end, almost all  members agreed on a specification for outcome- based forward guidance that indicated that the Committee expect s that it will be appropriate to maintain the current setting of the target range for the federal funds rate until labor market conditions had reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessments of maximum employment and inflation had risen to 2 percent and was on track to run moderately in excess of 2 percent for some time."
  One of these dissenting members preferred that the Committee retain greater policy rate flexibility by retaining  the language in the forward guidance provided in the July postmeeting statement; th at language noted that it would be appropriate to maintain the current target range until the Committee was confident that the economy had weathered recent events and was on track to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals.
  The other dissenting member preferred a  stronger formulation for the forward guidance —one in which the Committee would indicate that it expected to maintain the current target range until core inflation had reached 2  percent on a sustained basis.
" In their discussion of monetary policy for the p eriod ahead, members generally agreed that the Committee’s policy guidance expressed  its assessment about the path for the federal funds rate most likely to be consistent with achievement of the Committee’s goals , but that it was not an unconditional commi tment."
"  Members also agreed that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments."
"” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2:00 p.m.:  “The Federal Reserve is committed to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum employment and price stability goals."
 Economic activity and employment have picked up in recent months but remain well below their levels at the beginning of the year.
 Weaker demand and significantly lower oil prices are holding down consumer price inflation.
" The ongoing public health crisis will continue to weigh on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term, and poses considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term."
" Minutes of the Meeting of September 15–16, 2020Page 13_____________________________________________________________________________________________   The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2  percent over the longer run."
" With inflation running persistently below this longer -run goal, the Committee will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2  percent over time and longer -term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent."
 The Committee expects to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomes are achieved .
 The Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼  percent and expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessments of  maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2  percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2  percent for some time.
" In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook."
 The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals.
" The Committee’s assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments."
" President Kaplan dissented because he  expects that it will be appropriate to maintain the current target range until the Committee is confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals as arti culated in its new policy strategy statement, but prefers that the Committee retain greater policy rate flexibility beyond that point."
 President Kashkari  dissented because he prefers that the Committee indicate that it expects to maintain the current target range until core inflation has reached 2 percent on a sustained basis.
" Consistent with the Committee’s decision to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the Board of Governors voted unanimously to leave the interest rates on requi red and excess reserve balances at 0.10 percent."
" By notation vote completed on August 27, 2020, the Committee unanimously approved updates to its Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy."
"Clouse  Secretary   Page 14Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________   Summary of Economic Projections   In conjunction with the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting held on September 15 –16, 2020, meeting participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real gross domestic product (GDP) growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2020 to 2023 and over the longer run."
" Each participant’s projections were based on information available at the time of the meeting, together with her or his assessment of appropriate monetary policy—including a path for the federal funds rate and its longer -run value— and assumptions about other factors likely to affect economic outcomes."
" The longer -run projections represent each participant’s assessment of the value to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy.1  “Appropriate monetary policy” is defined as the f uture path of policy that each participant deems most likely to foster outcomes for economic activity and inflation that best satisfy his or her individual interpretation of the statutory mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability."
"The curre nt projections for real activity, the labor market, and inflation were notably stronger than the projections in the June 2020 Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) for the overlapping years from 2020 to 2022."
" Participants revised up  their economic outlook in light of the stronger -thanexpected rebound in  economic activity over recent months, although they noted that they remain ed attentive to the effects of the COVID19 pandemic and the measures taken to contain it."
" Additionally, almost all participants projected that  real GDP would grow faster than their estimates of its longer -run normal growth rate from 2021 to 2023 ."
 All participants  projected that the unemployment rate in the final quarter of 2020 would be notably lower than they had projected in June and that the unemployment rate would decline gradually during the forecast period.
" Most participants expected that a full economic recovery would take some time, and many projected that the unemployment rate in the final quarter of 2023 would be                                                             1 One participant did not submit longer -run projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, or the federal funds rate."
" A vast majority of participants projected that total inflation, as measured by the four -quarter percent change in the price index fo r personal consumption expenditures (PCE), would be at or below the FOMC’s 2 percent longer -run inflation objective throughout the forecast period."
" Projections for core PCE price inflation, which excludes consumer food and energy prices , generally followed a similar trajectory."
"   As shown in figure 2, most participants indicated that their expectations regarding the evolution of the economy, relative to the Committee’s maximum - employment and price -stability objectives, would likely warrant keeping the federal funds rate at its current level through at least the end of 2023."
" In addition, a substantial majority of participants assessed the risks to thei r outlook for real GDP growth as weighted to the downside and the risks to their unemployment rate projections as weighted to the upside."
 The risks to inflation projections were judged as weighted to the downside by a substantial majority of participants.
"  The Outlook for Real GDP Growth and the Unemployment Rate As shown in f igure 3.A , almost all participants continued to project that real GDP would decline in 2020, with the median projection anticipating a decrease of 3.7 percent."
" Almost all participants expected that the rate of real GDP growth from 2021 to 2023 would be above their estimates of its longer -run pace, with the median projections being 4.0 percent, 3 .0 percent , and 2.5 percent in these years , respectively."

"  Reflecting better -thanexpected incoming data since June, participants revised down their  projections for the unemployment rate considerably through 2022,  the forecast period in the June SEP (figure 3.B) ."
" The projections for the unemployment rate in the final quarter of this year ranged from 6.5 to 8.0  percent, with a median of 7.6 percent , and the ranges for projections  from 2020 to 2022 all  narrowed considerably since June."
" The median project ed levels of the unemployment rate in the final quarter s of 2021 and 2022—at 5.5 percent and 4.6  percent, respectively—were above the median estimate of the longer -run normal rate of unemployment of 4.1  percent."
" However, the median projection of the unemployment rate  in the final quarter of 2023, at 4.0  percent , was slightly below the median estimate of its  longer -run value."
 The distribution of estimat es for the longer -run unemployment rate was unchanged from the June SEP.
  Many participants indicated that they were still assessing whether the sharp contraction in economic activity during the first half of this year was  likely to leave a lasting imprint on the labor market or the productive capacity of the economy.
" The Outlook for Inflation  As shown in f igures 3.C and 3.D , almost all participants revised up their projections for inflation in 2020 relative to their June projections , with the median projections for total and core inflation at 1.2 percent and 1 .5 percent, respectively."
" Most participants expected inflation to rise over the next three years, although about half of them expected PCE price inflation to still fall short of the Committee’s longer -run 2 percent inflation objective by the end of the forecast horizon."
 A few participants projected  inflation to move above 2 percent before returning to 2  percent by 2023.
" A few participants expect ed inflation to move above its longer -run level in 2023, and several participants mentioned that they would expect inflation to rise above 2 percent in the years after."
"                                                             2 As a reference, table 2 provides estimates of the forecast uncertainty for the change in real GDP, the unemployment rate, and to tal consumer price inflation over the period from 2000 through 2019."
" Appropriate Monetary Policy As shown in figure 3.E, most participants projected that it would be appropriate to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent through at least the end of 2023 ."
 Most participants noted that their assessment of appropriate monetary policy took into account the new Statement on Longer -Run Goals an d Monetary Policy Strategy.
" In particular, because inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent, participants mentioned that they linked their assessment of the appropriate path of the federal funds rate to their assessment of shortfalls of employment from the Committee’s maximum -employment objective and to a moderate rise in inflation above 2 percent to help anchor inflation expectations at the Committee’s 2 percent longer -run goal."
" Uncertainty and Risk s In assessing the appropriate path for monetary policy, FOMC participants take account of the range of possible economic outcomes, the likelihood of those outcomes, and the potential benefits and costs should they occur."
" As shown in the panels on the left side of figure 4 , almost all participants continued to view the current uncertainty surrounding each of the four economic variables —real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, total PCE inflation, and core PCE inflation—as being greater than the average over t he past 20 years.2  A substantial majority of participants judged the risks to their projections for real GDP growth as weighted to the downside and the risks to their unemployment rate projections as weighted to the upside (figure 4) ."
 A substantial majority of participants viewed the risks to their inflation projections as weighted to the downside.

" As described in the box “Forecast Uncertainty,” under certai n assumptions, there is about a 70 percent probability that actual outcomes for real GDP, unemployment, consumer prices, and the federal funds rate will be in ranges implied by the average size of projection errors made in the past."
  Several participants also expressed concerns about global geopolitical developments and related tensions as well as prolonged recessionary dynamics such as labor market scarring or inflation persistently undershooting the Committee’s longer -run goal.
" Because the Committee adjusts monetary policy in response to actual and prospective developments over time in key economic variables —such as real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation —uncertainty surrounding the projected path for the federal funds rate importantly reflects the uncertainties about the paths for these economic variables, along with other factors."
  Page 12Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________       Forecast Uncertainty The economic projections provided by the members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks inform discussions of monetary policy among policymakers and can aid public understanding of the basis for policy actions.
" Thus, in setting the stance of monetary policy, participants consider not only what appears to be the most likely economic outcome as embodied in their projections, but also the range of alternative possibilities, the likelihood of their occurring, and the potential costs to the economy should they occur."
"Table 2 summarizes the average historical accuracy of a range of forecasts, including those reported in past Monetary Policy Report s and those prepared by the Federal Reserve Board’s staff in advance of meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee."
" The corresponding 70  percent confidence intervals for overall inflation would be 1.2 to 2.8 percent in the current year, 1.0 to 3.0  percent in the second year, 0.9 to 3.1 percent in  the third year, and 1.0 to 3.0 percent in the fourth year."
" As with real activity and inflation, the outlook for the future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable uncertainty."
 This uncertainty arises primarily because each parti cipant ’s assessment of the appropriate stance of monetary policy depends importantly on the evolution of real activity and inflation over time.
 The final line in table 2 shows the error ranges for forecasts of short -term interest rates.
" It should be noted, however, that these confidence intervals are not strictly consistent with the projections for the federal funds rate, as these projections are not forecasts of the most likely quarterly outcomes but rather are projection s of participants’ individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy and are on an end -ofyear basis."
" However, the forecast errors should provide a sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy that would be appropriate to offset the effects of shocks to the economy."
