"Willis, Vice Presidents, Federal Reserve Banks of Cleveland, Boston, and Kansas City , respectively    Developments in Financial Markets and Open Market Operations The manager of the System Open Market Account (SOMA) reported on developments in domestic and foreign financial markets, including recent monetary policy actions of foreign central banks and the expectations of market participants for the trajectory of U.S. monetary policy."
monetary policy implementation was effective in maintaining control over the federal funds rate.
" In addition, the deputy manager reviewed recent and projected trends in foreign portfolio income of the SOMA, including the implications for portfolio income of foreign nominal interest rates that were very low, even negative."
" In the ensuing discussion of this question among Committee participants, it was noted that, in view of the very elevated capacity of the overnight (ON) RRP facility that would remain available for the time being, offering term RRPs in addition to ON RRPs would be unlikely to enhance control of the federal funds rate over quarterend, and offering term RRPs at an interest rate spread over ON RRPs could marginally increase the Federal Reserve’s interest costs."
" Consumer price inflation was still running below the Committee’s  longerrun objective of 2 percent, restrained in part by decreases in both consumer energy prices and the prices of nonenergy imports."
"Page 2Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ longerrun inflation expectations were little changed, on balance, in recent months, while marketbased measures of inflation compensation remained low."
Total nonfarm payroll employment increased in January and February at a solid average monthly pace.
" The unemployment rate declined to 4.9 percent in January and remained at that level in February, while both the labor force participation rate and the employmentto-population ratio increased over these months."
 The fourweek moving average of initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits moved down in February and early March after increasing a little in January.
" Compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector increased 2½ percent over the four quarters of 2015, and the employment cost index rose nearly 2 percent over the 12 months ending in December; both increases were similar to their averages in recent years."
" Manufacturing output rose, reversing the declines seen in the two previous months, and the output of utilities moved up sharply as the demand for heating rebounded after having been held down by unseasonably warm weather in December."
Growth in real personal consumption expenditures (PCE) appeared to pick up some in the first quarter.
 Recent readings on key factors that influence consumer spending generally pointed toward solid growth in real PCE over the first half of the year.
Growth in total real government purchases appeared to be modest in the first quarter.
"The U.S. international trade deficit widened in both December and January, as exports declined in both months, continuing a downward trend that began in late 2014, with particular weakness in exports of capital goods."
" Net exports subtracted from real GDP growth Minutes of the Meeting of March 15–16, 2016Page 3_____________________________________________________________________________________________ in the fourth quarter, and the January trade data suggested that net exports would continue to weigh on growth in the first quarter."
" Core PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in food and energy prices, was 1¾ percent over the same 12month period, held down in part by decreases in the prices of nonenergy imports and the passthrough of declines in energy prices."
" Over the 12 months ending in February, total consumer prices as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) rose 1 percent, while core CPI inflation was around 2¼ percent."
" Both readings on core inflation were boosted, in part, by movements in prices for some categories of goods and services whose prices tend to be volatile."
" Survey measures of longerrun inflation expectations —including those from the Michigan survey, Blue Chip Economic Indicators, Survey of Professional Forecasters, Survey of Primary Dealers, and Survey of Market Participants —were generally little changed on balance."
" In February, the Michigan survey measure of median inflation expectations over the next 5 to 10 years was below its typical range of the past 15 years, likely reflecting —at least in part —decreases in energy prices over the past year and a half."
"  Foreign real GDP growth slowed in the fourth quarter, with Canadian activity restrained by declines in oilrelated investment and the Japanese economy contracting amid weakness in consumption."
" Economic growth continued to be steady but modest in the euro area and the United Kingdom, while Brazil remained in recession."
" In contrast, some economies in emerging Asia recorded robust growth."
 Indicators pointed to a pickup in growth in most foreign economies in the current quarter but to a further softening of growth in China.
 Inflation in the advanced foreign economies remained low.
" In contrast, inflation rose in China because of a rebound in local food prices, while inflation in much of South America remained elevated, reflecting weaker currencies."
 Concerns about persistently low inflation spurred further monetary policy accommodation by the Bank of Japan (BOJ) and the European Central Bank (ECB).
"Staff Review of the Financial Situation Financial markets were turbulent over the first month and a half of the year, apparently reflecting investors’ concerns about global growth prospects and associated risks to the U.S. outlook."
"Yields on 5and 10year nominal Treasury securities declined at the outset of the intermeeting period, reflecting the continued pullback from risky assets that began early in the year on concerns about prospects for global economic growth."
" Measures of inflation compensation over the next 5 years rose, on net, consistent with increases in oil prices, while inflation compensation 5 to 10 years ahead was little changed on the period and remained at the lower end of its historical range."
"After becoming considerably flatter early in the intermeeting period, the path of the federal funds rate implied by market quotes on interest rate derivatives steepened subsequently as financial market conditions improved and was little changed, on balance, over the intermeeting period."
" Commercial and industrial loan growth at banks was also strong, mostly driven by the origination of large loans to investmentgrade borrowers."
" Longterm sovereign bond yields declined notably in the advanced economies, in part as foreign central banks announced additional monetary policy easing measures."
"  Staff Economic Outlook In the U.S. economic forecast prepared by the staff for the March FOMC meeting, real GDP in the first half of the year was projected to increase a little more slowly than in the forecast prepared for the January meeting, although estimated real GDP growth in the fourth quarter of last year was revised up."
 The unemployment rate was expected to gradually decline further and to run somewhat below the staff’s estimate of its lon gerrun natural rate over this period; the staff’s estimate of the natural rate was revised down slightly in this forecast.
"The staff’s forecast for inflation over the first half of the year was revised up somewhat, reflecting recent increases in the price of crude oil as well as strongerthan-expected data on core consumer prices early in the year."
" The staff continued to project that inflation would increase gradually over the next several years, as energy prices and the prices of nonenergy imported goods were expected to begin steadily rising later this year."
" As a result, inflation was projected still to be sli ghtly below the Committee’s longer -run objective of 2 percent in 2018."
"The staff viewed the uncertainty around its March projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as similar to the average of the past 20 years."
" Consistent with the downside risk to aggregate demand, the staff viewed the risks to its outlook for the unemployment rate as skewed to the upside."
" The risks to the projection for inflation were still seen as weighted to the downside, reflecting the possibility that longerterm inflation expectations may have edged down, and that the foreign exchange value of the dollar could rise substantially, which would put additional downward pressure on inflation."
"Participants’  Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, members of the Board of Governors and Federal Reserve Bank presidents submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, inflation, and the federal funds rate for each year from 2016 through 2018 and over the longer run."
 Each participant’s projections were conditioned on his or her judgment of appropriate monetary policy.
" The longerrun projections represent each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy."
"In their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants viewed the information received over the intermeeting period as suggesting that economic activity had been expanding moderately despite the global economic and financial developments of recent months."
" A range of labor market indicators, including strong employment growth and rising labor force participation, pointed to a further strengthening of the labor market."
 Participants generally saw the data on economic activity and labor market conditions as broadly consistent with their earlier expectations.
" Inflation picked up in recent months, but it continued to run below the Committee’s 2 percent longer -run objective."
" Marketbased measures of inflation compensation remained low, while surveybased measures of longerterm inflation expectations were little changed, on balance, in recent months."
"With respect to the outlook for economic activity and the labor market, participants shared the assessment that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, real GDP would continue to increase at a moderate rate over the medium term and labor market indicators would continue to strengthen."
" Many participants, however, anticipated that relative strength in household spending would be partially offset by weakness in net exports associated with lackluster foreign growth and the appreciation of the dollar since mid2014."
"  Furthermore, participants generally saw global economic and financial developments as continuing to pose risks to the outlook for economic activity and the labor market in the United States."
 Several participants also noted the possibility that economic activity or labor market conditions could turn out to be stronger than anticipated.
" For example, strong expansion of household demand could result in rapid employment growth and overly tight resource utilization, particularly if productivity gains remained sluggish."
"Notwithstanding the downward revisions to recent retail sales data, participants were encouraged by the moderate average growth of consumer spending over recent quarters."
 Continued increases in household spending had buoyed growth of overall aggregate demand despite the volatility in financial markets.
" Solid gains in employment and income, the relatively high ratio of household wealth to income, low gasoline prices, and a high level of consumer confidence were seen as factors that should contribute to moderate growth in consumer spending."
"In contrast, several participants noted recent softness in business fixed investment and signs that the sluggish growth would continue."
 The possible adverse effects on investment spending of concerns about global growth and the associated volatility in financial markets were also noted.
"With regard to the external sector, a number of participants said that they expected declines in net exports to continue to subtract from real GDP growth, reflecting weak foreign activity as well as the earlier appreciation of the dollar ."
" The outlook for growth abroad had dimmed in recent months, suggesting a more persistent drag on growth of U.S. exports."
" A couple of participants commented that emerging market economies faced an extended period of less rapid export growth, reflecting slower economic growth in many advanced foreign economies and in China."
 It also was noted that weak growth abroad could lead to further appreciation of the dollar.
" In their comments on labor market conditions, participants cited strong payroll gains and a further tick down in the civilian unemployment rate."
" Some participants judged that current labor market conditions were at or near those consistent with maximum sustainable employment, noting that the unemployment rate was at or below their estimates of its longerrun normal level and citing anecdotal reports of labor shortages or increased wage pressures."
" In contrast, some other participants judged that the economy had not yet reached maximum employment."
 They noted several indicators other than the unemployment rate that pointed to remaining underutilization of labor resources; these indicators included the stillhigh rate of involuntary parttime employment and the low level of the employmentto-population ratio for primeage workers.
 The surprisingly limited extent to which aggregate data indicated upward pressure on wage growth also suggested some remaining slack in labor markets.
Participants commented on the recent increase in inflation.
 Some participants saw the increase as consistent with a firming trend in inflation.
" Participants continued to anticipate that inflation would run below the Committee’s 2 percent objective in the near term but that, as the transitory effects of earlier declines in energy and import prices dissipated and the labor market strengthened further, inflation would rise to 2 percent over the medium term."
 Several participants indicated that the persistence of global disinflationary pressures or the possibility that inflation expectations were moving lower continued to pose downside risks to the inflation outlook.
" A few others expressed the view that there were also risks that could lead to inflation running higher than anticipated; for example, overly tight resource utilization could push inflation above the Committee’s 2  percent goal, particularly if productivity gains remained sluggish."
Participants discussed readings from various marketand surveybased measures of longerrun inflation expectations.
 The marketbased measures of inflation compensation that had declined earlier were still at low levels.
" Some participants concluded that longerrun inflation expectations remained reasonably stable, but some others expressed concern that long errun inflation expectations may have already moved lower, or that they might do so if inflation was to persist for much longer at a rate below the Committee ’s objective."
" Some noted that recent financial market turbulence provided an important reminder that the ability of central banks to offset the effects of adverse economic shocks might be limited, particularly by the low level of policy interest rates in most advanced economies."
" Nonetheless, many participants indicated that the heightened global risks and the asymmetric ability of monetary policy to respond to them warranted caution in making adjustments to the stance of U.S. monetary policy."
" Moreover, the sharp asset price movements that occurred earlier in the year had been reversed to a large extent, but longerterm interest rates and market participants’ expectations for the future path of the federal funds rate remained lower."
" Taking these developments into account, participants generally judged that the mediumterm outlook for domestic demand was not appreciably different than it had been when the Committee met in December."
" However, most participants, while recognizing the likely positive effects of recent policy actions abroad, saw foreign economic growth as likely to run at a somewhat slower pace than previously expected, a development that probably would further restrain growth in U.S. exports and tend to damp overall aggregate demand."
 Several participants also cited wider credit spreads as a factor that was likely to restrain growth in demand.
" Many participants also noted that a somewhat lower projected interest rate path was one reason for the relatively small revisions in their mediumterm projections for economic activity, unemployment, and inflation."
"Several participants also argued for proceeding cautiously in reducing policy accommodation because they saw the risks to the U.S. economy stemming from developments abroad as tilted to the downside or because they were concerned that longerterm inflation expectations might be slipping lower, skewing the risks to the outlook for inflation to the downside."
" Many participants noted that, with the target range for the federal funds rate only slightly above zero, the FOMC continued to have little room to ease monetary policy through conventional means if economic activity or inflation turned out to be materially weaker than anticipated, but could raise rates quickly if the economy appeared to be overheating or if inflation was to increase significantly more rapidly than anticipated."
" In their view, this asymmetry made it prudent to wait for additional information regarding the underlying strength of economic activity and prospects for inflation before taking another step to reduce policy accommodation."
" These participants saw their judgment as consistent with the Committee’s data -dependent approach to setting monetary policy; it was noted that, in this context, the relevant data include not only domestic economic releases, but also information about developments abroad and changes in financial conditions that bear on the economic outlook."
" A couple of participants, however, saw an increase in the target range to ½ to ¾ percent as appropriate at this meeting, citing evidence that the economy was continuing to expand at a moderate rate despite developments abroad and earlier volatility in financial conditions, continued improvement in labor market conditions, the firming of inflation over recent months, and the apparent levelingoff of oil prices."
"Page 8Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ Participants agreed that their ongoing assessments of the data and the implications for the outlook, rather than calendar dates, would determine the timing and pace of future adjustments to the stance of monetary policy."
  A number of participants judged that the headwinds restraining growth and holding down the neutral rate of interest were likely to subside only slowly.
" In contrast, some other participants indicated that an increa se in the target range at the Committee’s next meeting might well be warranted if the incoming economic data remained consistent with their expectations for moderate growth in output, further strengthening of the labor market, and inflation rising to 2 percent over the medium term."
"Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that information received since the Committee met in January suggested that economic activity had been expanding at a moderate pace despite the global economic and financial developments of recent months."
" Members noted that inflation had picked up in recent months; however, they also noted that inflation had continued to run below the Committee’s 2 percent longerrun objective, partly reflecting declines in energy prices and in prices of nonenergy imports."
 Marketbased measures of inflation compensation remained low.
" Surveybased measures of longerterm inflation expectations were little changed, on balance, in recent months."
"With respect to the economic outlook and its implications for monetary policy, members continued to expect that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity would expand at a moderate pace and labor market indicators would continue to strengthen."
" Members also continued to expect inflation to remain low in the near term, in part because of earlier declines in energy prices, but to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of declines in energy and import prices dissipated and the labor market strengthened further."
 Members noted the increase in inflation reported in recent months but expressed a range of views about the extent to which the increase would prove persistent.
 Several members expressed concern that longerrun inflation expectations may have declined.
 Members agreed they would continue to monitor inflation developments closely.
 This accommodative stance of monetary policy was expected to support further improvement in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation.
" One member, however, preferred to raise the target range for the federal funds rate, indicating that the current low level of real interest rates was not appropriate in the context of current economic conditions and the progress that had been achieved toward the Committee’s objectives."
" Members again agreed that, in determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee would assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation."
" This assessment would take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
" In light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, the Committee agreed that it would carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal."
" However, members agreed that future data and developments could lead to changes in the economic outlook and in their projections of appropriate monetary policy, and that the actual path of the federal funds rate would depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data."
” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at  2:00 p.m.: “Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in January suggests that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace despite the global economic and financial developments of recent months.
" Inflation picked up in recent months; however, it continued to run below the Committee’s 2  percent longerrun objective, partly reflecting declines in energy prices and in prices of nonenergy imports."
" Marketbased measures of inflation compensation remain low; surveybased measures of longerterm inflation expectations are little changed, on balance, in recent months."
"Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
" The Committee currently expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market indicators will continue to strengthen."
" Inflation is expected to remain low in the near term, in part because of earlier declines in energy prices, but to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further."
 The Committee continues to monitor inflation developments closely.
" The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting further improvement in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation."
"In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation."
" This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
" In light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, the Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal."
" Although risks to the global economy had increased in recent months and financial markets were unusually volatile at times, she believed that monetary policy should focus primarily on progress toward the Committee’s lon gerrun objectives."
" Recently, labor market conditions had continued to strengthen, with the economy apparently near full employment, and some data had suggested a firming of underlying inflation trends."
 She believed that monetary policy should respond to these developments by gradually removing accommodation.
"Consistent with the Committee’s decision to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the Board of Governors took no action to change the interest rates on reserves or discount rates."
"Madigan Secretary Minutes of the Meeting of March 15–16, 2016Page 11_____________________________________________________________________________________________Summary of Economic ProjectionsIn conjunction with the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting held on March 15–16, 2016, meeting participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real output growth, the unemployment rate, inflation, and the federal funds rate for each year from 2016 to 2018 and over the longer run."
" Each participant’s projection was based on information available at the time of the meeting, together with his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy and assumptions about the factors likely to affect economic outcomes."
" The longerrun projections represent each participant’s assessment of the value to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy."
 “Appropriate monetary policy” is defined as the future path of policy that each participant deems most likely to foster outcomes for economic activity and inflation that best satisfy his or her individual interpretation of the Federal Reserve’s objectives of maximum employment and stable prices.
"FOMC participants generally expected that, under appropriate monetary policy, growth in real gross domestic product (GDP) would be at or somewhat above their individual estimates of the longerrun growth rate in 2016 and 2017 and would converge toward the longerrun rate in 2018 (table 1 and figure 1)."
" All participants projected that by the end of the current year, the unemployment rate would decline to, or fall below, their individual estimates of the longerrun normal unemployment rate —that is, their projected unemployment gaps would be zero or negative —and that these zero or negative gaps would persist through 2018, even though many participants reduced their estimates of the longerrun normal rate."
" All participants projected that inflation, as measured by the fourquarter change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), would pick up in 2016 and 2017 from the very low rate seen in 2015."
  Participants generally projected inflation to be either at or just slightly below the Committee’s 2 percent objective by the end of 2018.
"As shown in figure 2, participants expected that it would be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate gradually over the projection period as headwinds to economic growth dissipate slowly over time and as inflation rises toward the Committee’s goal of 2 percent."
Almost all participants regarded the levels of uncertainty associated with their forecasts for economic growth and the unemployment rate as broadly similar to the norms of the previous 20 years and shared a similar view regarding the uncertainty surrounding their inflation projections.
 Participants were about evenly divided as to whether they judged the risks to their forecasts for real GDP growth to be weighted to the downside or broadly balanced; no participant saw risks to real GDP growth as weighted to the upside.
" Participants who thought that risks to their outlook for real GDP growth were skewed to the downside tended to cite developments in foreign economies, recent volatility in financial markets, or the limited capacity of policy to respond to adverse developments as contributing to that view."
 Risk perceptions regarding the unemployment rate were more dispersed.
" Most participants regarded risks to their unemployment rate forecast s as broadly balanced, but four participants considered risks as skewed toward a higher unemployment rate, and two viewed risks as weighted towa rd a lower unemployment rate."
 A majority of participants thought that the risks attending their projections for PCE price inflation were weighted to the downside ; almost all of these participants also saw risks to core PCE inflation as tilted in the same direction.
" Among the reasons cited by participants for perceptions of downside risk to their inflation projections were ongoing developments in overseas economies and their possible implications for U.S. import prices, declines in energy prices since December, and low readings for some indicators of longterm inflation expectations."
"   The Outlook for Economic Activity A substantial majority of participants expected that, conditional on their individual assumptions about appropriate monetary policy, real GDP in 2016 and 2017 would increase at a rate above their individual estimates of the longerrun normal growth rate before decelerating to a pace at or near their individual estimates of the longerrun normal rate."
" A number of participants indicated that they expected domestic factors —including improving labor market conditions, stronger household and business balance sheets, lower consumer energy prices, and a stillaccommodative stance of monetary policy —to contribute to strength in aggregate expenditures, while Page 1_____________________________________________________________________________________________Table 1."

Projections forthe unemployment rate are for the average civilian unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of the year indicated.
Each participant’s projections arebased on his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy.
Longerrun projections represent each participant’s assessment of the rate to which eachvariable would be expected to converge under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy.

"Compared with their forecasts prepared for the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) in December, most participants marked down their projections of real GDP growth in 2016, and several did so for 2017."
" Overall, the median value of participants’ projections for real GDP growth in 2016 was revised down a little to 2.2 percent, and that for 2017 was revised down slightly to 2.1 percent."
The median forecast for the unemployment rate was a bit lower in 2017 and 2018 than in December and show ed a modest downward tilt over the three years of the forecast.
" Moreover, many participants also reduced their estimates of the longerrun normal rate of unemployment, resulting in a modest reduction in the median of the longerrun rate."
" Thus, while a majority expected the unemployment rate gap to turn negative by the end of this year, fewer participants projected a negative gap at that time than was the case in December."
" For 2017, all participants projected a negative unemployment rate gap, and a substantial majority did so for 2018 as well ."
" All told, however, the medians of the unemployment rate gaps for the three years of the projection were essentially unchanged from the December SEP."
Figures 3.A and 3.B show the distribution of participants’ views regarding the likely outcomes for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate through 2018 and in the longer run.
" The distribution of the projections of GDP growth shifted toward lower values for 2016; differences from December for 2017 and 2018 were less noteworthy, but there was a modest narrowing of the distribution for 2018."
" The distributions of projections for the unemployment rate in 2017 and beyond shifted modestly toward lower values , relative to the December SEP, on the basis of strong labor market indicators in recent months."
 The Outlook for Inflation All participants projected PCE price inflation to pick up in 2016 and to rise further in 2 017.
" For 2018, nearly all expected PCE price inflation to be at or very close to the Committee’s 2 percent longer -run objective."
" However, relative to the December SEP, almost all participants marked down their projections for PCE price inflation in 2016, observing that declines in energy prices since the end of last year and continued strength in the dollar were expected to impart additional downward pressure on inflation this year."
" Many participants also lowered their projections for inflation in 2017, although the median value for that year was unchanged ."
 Inflation projections in 2018 were little changed from December.
" Regarding core PCE price inflation, s ome participants marked down their projections for 2016, although almost all still expected core inflation to rise gradually over the projection period and to be at or very close to 2 percent by the end of 2018."
" Factors cited by participants as contributing to their expectation that inflation will rise over the medium term included recent readings for core inflation , an anticipation that improvements in labor markets will continue, the fading effects of recent dollar appreciation and declines in oil prices, and an assessment that longterm inflation expectations will remain at levels consistent with the FOMC’s 2 percent objective, all supported by a stance of monetary policy that participants generally described as accommodative."
 Figures 3.C and 3.D provide information on the distribution of participants’ views about the outlook for inflation.
" The distribution for PCE price inflation in 2016 shifted notably to the left compared with the December SEP, while changes in the distributions of projections for 2017 and 2018 were small."
 The distributions of participants’ projections for core PCE price inflation shifted only a touch toward lower values for 2017 and 2018 as compared with December.

" Hence, with all participants anticipating that inflation would eventually reach the Committee’s objective of 2  percent, the range of participants’ judgments of the longerrun level of the real federal funds rate was also unchanged from December , at 1 to 2 percent; the median value for the longerrun real rate was 1.25 percent, down 0 .25 percentage point from December."
"Participants’ views of the appropriate path for monetary policy were informed by their judgments about the outlook for economic activity, labor markets, and inflation as well as the risks and uncertainties associated with that outlook."
" One important consideration for many participants was their assessment that several factors —including weak foreign economic conditions, a persistently high exchange value of the dollar, and tight er financial conditions —will continue to restrain economic growth for a time and thus collectively imply a temporarily low level for the neutral rate of interest."
" These forces, combined with the current proximity of shortterm interest rates to their effective lower bound and the related asymmetry of risks around the outlook for real GDP growth and inflation, were noted as reasons why a gradual approach to raising the federal funds rate would be appropriate, provided that the outlook for the economy unfolded about as expected."
 Another consideration underlying the anticipated gradual removal of policy accommodation involved the prospects for inflation to return to the Com mittee’s objective of 2  percent.
" In assessing those prospects, participants weighed the implications of a range of factors, including indicators of longerrun inflation expectations and the magnitude and persistence of the effects of both low energy prices and the earlier appreciation of the dollar."
 Judgments regarding the likely future strength of the labor market and future wage gains also figured into participants’ forecasts for inflation.
"                                                 1 Table 2 provides estimates of the forecast uncertainty for the change in real GDP, the unemployment rate, and total consumer price inflation over the period from 1996 through 2015."
" At the end of this summary, the box “Forecast Uncertainty” Uncertainty and Risks  As in the December SEP, nearly all participants judged the levels of uncertainty around their projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and both headline and core PCE price inflation as broadly similar to the average levels of the past 20 years (as shown in the lefthand column of figure 4).1  In contrast, participants revised appreciably their assessments of the risks to real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and both headline and core inflation since December (as shown in the righthand column)."
  Eight participants saw the risks to real GDP growth as weighted to the downside —up from three in December.
 Four participants saw risks to the unemployment rate as skewed toward higher unemployment —two more than in December —while two continued to see risks weighted toward lower unemployment.
 Explanations for the less marked shift in risks to the outlook for the unemployment rate versus the outlook for real GDP growth included favorable labor market news over the past three months.
" More generally, participants cited financial market and global economic conditions, either on their own or coupled with the limited capacity of policymakers to respond to possible adverse economic conditions, as reasons for the downward tilt to their perceptions of the risks to growth."

" As described in the box “Forecast Uncertainty,” under c ertain assumptions, there is about a 70 percent probability that actual outcomes for real GDP, unemployment, and consumer prices will be in ranges implied by the average size of projection errors made in the past."

" Many participants noted some recent evidence of a deterioration, or an absence of improvement, in indicators of longterm inflation expectations as contributing to increased downside risks for inflation, while some pointed to the further declines in energy prices."
"   Summary of Economic Projections of the Meeting of March 15–16, 2016Page 13_____________________________________________________________________________________________       Forecast Uncertainty     The economic projections provided by the members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks inform discussions of monetary policy among policymakers and can aid public understanding of the basis for policy actions."
"Table 2 summarizes the average historical accuracy of a range of forecasts, including those reported in past Monetary Policy Report s and those prepared by the Federal Reserve Board’s staff in advance of meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee."
 The corresponding 70 percent confidence  intervals for overall inflation would be 1.1 to 2.9 percent in the current year and  0.9 to 3.1 percent in the second and third years.
" As with real activity and inflation, the outlook for the future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable uncertainty."
 This uncertainty arises primarily because ea ch participant’s assessment of the appropriate stance of monetary policy depends importantly on the evolution of real activity and inflation over time.
