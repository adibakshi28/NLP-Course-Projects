"The Federal Reserve’s balance sheet increased modestly over the intermeeting period to $7.2 trillion, as growth in securities holdings was part ially offset by a decline in U.S. dollar liquidity swaps outstanding."
" Discussion on Asset Purchases Participants discussed the FO MC’s asset purchases, including the role they are playing in supporting the Committee’s maximumemployment and pricestability goals."
" With market functioning seen as having largely recovered, many participants indicated that the role of asset purchases had shifted more toward fostering accommodative financial conditions for households and businesses to support the Committee’s employment and inflation goals."
 Some of these participants also saw such updated guidance as reinforcing the Committee’s commitment to fostering outcomes consistent with maximum employment and inflation that averages 2 percent over time.
" Some participants noted that, if needed, the Federal Reserve could consider various steps to manage the le vels of shortterm interest rates and the quantity of reserves, such as adjusting administered rates, expanding the overnight reverse repurchase agreement program, or implementing a maturity extension program."
    Staff Review of the Economic Situation  The coronavirus pandemic and the measures undertaken to contain its spread continued to affect economic activity in the United States and abroad.
" Labor market conditions improved further in September, although the pace of gains eased and employment continued to be  well below its level at the beginning of the year."
 Consumer price inflation—as measured by the 12month percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) through September—had returned to its yearearlier pace but remained noticeably below the rates that were posted in January and February.
"Total nonfarm payroll employment expanded strongly in September, but the gain was markedly below the even larger increases seen in previous months."
" Through September, payroll employment had retraced only about half of the decline seen at the onset of the pandemic."
 Page 4Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________The unemployment rate moved down further to 7.9 percent in September.
" The unemployment rates for African Americans and Asians both decreased, but the unemployment rate for Hispanics was little changed, and each group’s rate remained well above the national average."
" In addition, the overall labor force participation rate declined, and the employmentto-population ratio rose only slightly."
" Initial claims  for unemployment insurance continued to move lower, on net, through late October, and weekly estimates of privatesector payrolls constructed by the Board’s staf f using data provided by the payroll processor ADP suggested that employment gains from midSeptember to midOctober remained solid."
" The employment cost index (ECI) for total hourly labor compensation in the private sector, which likely had been less influenced than other hourly compensation measures by the concentration of recent job losses among lowerwage workers, rose 2.4 percent over the 12 months ending in September."
Total PCE price inflation was 1.4 percent over the 12 months ending in September and continued to be held down by relatively weak aggregate demand and the declines in consumer energy prices seen earlier in the year.
" Core PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in consumer energy prices and many consumer food prices, was 1.5 percent over the same period, while the trimmed mean measure of 12month PCE price inflation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas was 1.9 percent in September."
" On a monthly basis, inflation was a little lower in September, largely reflecting slower goods price inflation."
" The latest readings on survey-based measures of longerrun inflation expectations moved lower, though each remained within the range in which it has fluctuated in recent years; in October, the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers measure for the next 5 to 10 years fell back to the level that prevailed in early 2020, while in  September the 3year-ahead measure from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York retraced its August increase."
" Activity in this sector was likely being suppor ted by low interest rates, the sector’s ability to adjust business practices in response to social distancing, and pentup demand following the widespread shutdowns earlier in the year."
Growth in both total industrial production and manufacturing output turned negative in September after having slowed markedly in August.
" Part of the softness in manufacturing production appeared to be attributable to pandemicrelated delays in the motor vehicle industry’s modelyear changeover, though subdued foreign demand and weaker demand from domestic energy producers were also likely acting to restrain factory output."
The nominal U.S. international trade deficit narrowed in September after widening in August.
" In contrast, goods exports by September recovered only twothirds of their decline since January despite brisk growth in exports of agricultural products and industrial supplies."
" Altogether, net exports made a substantial negative contribution to real GDP growth in the third quarter."
Economic activity abroad rebounded sharply in the third quarter following a rollback of pandemicrelated restrictions.
" Domestic demand supported the recovery, and in Asia there was also a strong rebound of exports, especially of electronics and, more recently, autos."
" Thirdquarter growth was particularly rapid in those economies that experienced some of the deepest contractions in the second quart er, including France, Italy, and Spain among the advanced foreign economies (AFEs) and Mexico among the emerging market economies."
" After falling through the end of the summer in many countries, inflation rate s started to rise over the past two months but remained well below rates from early in the year."
" Inflation compensation increased a little further, remaining close to prepandemic levels."
" Measures of inflation compensation based on Treasury InflationProtected Securities (TIPS) edged up, on net, remaining close to their prepandemic levels."
" However, both the 5year and 5to-10year measures of inflation compensation remained near the lower ends of their historical ranges."
" Several Asian currencies, including the Chinese renminbi, the South Korean won, and the Taiwanese dollar, appreciated against the U.S. dollar amid improving growth prospects and low COVID19 case counts."
"  Financing conditions in capital markets continued to be broadly accommodative over the intermeeting period, supported by low interest rates and high equity valuations."
" Collateralized loan ob ligation issuance was strong in September, likely supporting robust investor demand for newly issued leveraged loan s in the coming months."
" In addition, demand for C&I loans reportedly weakened in the third quarter."
" In co ntrast, CRE loan growth at banks decelerated in the thir d quarter, while standards for CRE loans tightened further, according to the October SLOOS."
" Banks in the October SLOOS indicated that standards tightened and demand was little changed, on balance, across consumer loan types following a sharp contraction in demand in the second quarter."
" Interest rates on existing accounts were little changed and remain ed below precrisis levels, while interest rates on new accounts to nonprime borrowers remained elevated."
 Auto loan interest rates increased but stayed below prepandemic levels.
" The staff judged that, accounting for low interest rates, asset valuations appeared moderate, with measures of compensation for risk generally in the middle of their historical ranges."
" Staff Economic Outlook In the U.S. economic projection prepared by the staff for the November FOMC meeting, the rate of real GDP growth and the pace of declines in the unemployment rate over the second half of this year were similar to those in the September forecast despite material revisions to several assumptions influencing the outlook along with incoming data that were, on balance, better than expected."
" The inflation forecast for the rest of the year was revised up slightly in response to incoming readings on inflation that were, on balance, higher than expected."
" Nevertheless, inflation was still projected to finish the year at a relatively subdued le vel, reflecting substantial margins of slack in labor and product markets and the large declines in consumer energy prices seen earlier in the year."
"In the staff’s mediumterm projection, the assumption that significant additional fiscal support would not be enacted pointed to a lower trajectory for aggregate demand going forward."
" Hence, with monetary policy assumed to remain highly accommodative and socialdistancing measures expected to ease further, the staff continued to project that real GDP over the medium term would outpace potential, leading to a considerable further decline in the unemployment rate."
" The resulting takeup of economic slack was in turn expected to cause inflation to  increase gradually, and the inflation rate was projected to moderately overshoot 2 percent for some time in the years beyond 2023 as monetary policy remained accommodative."
 Economic activity and employment had continued to recover but remained well below their levels at the beginning of the year.
 Weaker demand and earlier declines in oil prices had been holding down consumer price inflation.
" Participants agreed that the path of the economy would depend on the course of the virus and that the ongoing public health crisis would continue to weigh on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term and posed considerable risks to the economy’s mediumterm outlook."
" In recent months, however, the pace of improvement had moderated, with slower growth expected for the fourth quarter."
 Participants noted that economic activity thus far had recovered faster than had been expected earlier in the year.
" Participants commented that the rebound in consumer spending was due in part to federal stimulus payments and expanded unemployment benefits, which provided essential support to many households."
 Participants viewed accommodative monetary policy as also contributing to gains in durable goods and residential investment as well as the surge in  home sales.
" Contacts reported improved conditions in the agricultural sector, boosted by strong demand from China as well as domestic ethanol production, higher crop prices, and federal aid payments."
" The unemployment rate had declined further, and the employment gains since the spring were generally seen as larger than anticipated."
" Several part icipants noted that the decline in the unemployment rate in recent months had been accompanied by a fall in  the labor force participation rate, particularly among those with a high school education or lower and among women."
" A couple of them noted that many businesses in industries severely affected by the pandemic were downsizing or that so me businesses were focused on cutting costs or increasing productivity, including through automation."
" In addition, a slow job market recovery would caus e particular hardship for those with less educational attainment, less access to childcare or broadband, or greater need for retraining."
"  In their comments about inflation, participants noted that some consumer prices had increased more quickly than expected in recent months but that broader price trends were still quite soft."
" The upturn in consumer price inflation was primarily attributed to price increases in sectors where the pandemic had induced stronger demand, such as consumer durables."
" In contrast, services price inflation remained softer than prepandemic rates, as prices for the categories most affected by social distancing, such as accommodations and airfares, continued to be very depressed an d housing services inflation moderated."
 Some participants commented that the recent surge in virus cases in Europe an d the reimposition of restrictions there could lead to a slowdown in economic activity in the euro area an d have negative spillover effects on the U.S. recovery.
" Some participants raised concerns regarding the longerrun effects of the pandemic, including sectoral restructurings that could slow employment growth or an acceleration of technological disruptions that could be limiting the pricing power of some firms."
" A couple of participants expressed concerns that a prolonged period of low interest rates and highly accommodative financial market conditions could lead to excessive risktaking, which in Page 10Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________turn could result in elevated firm bankruptcies and significant employment losses in the next economic downturn."
" In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, participants reaffirmed th e Federal Reserve’s commitment to using its full range of tools in order to support the U.S. economy during this challenging time, thereby promoting the Committee’s statutory goals of maximum employment and price stability."
"  Participants agreed that the path of the economy would depend significantly on the course of the virus and that the ongoing public health crisis would continue  to weigh on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term and posed considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term."
" In light of  this assessment, all participants judged that maintaining an accommodative stance of monetary policy was essential to foster economic recovery and to achieve the Committee’s longrun 2 percent inflation objective."
  Participants remarked that the Committee’s action in September to provide more explicit outcomebased forward guidance for the federal funds rate had been an important step to affirm the Committee’s strong commitment to the goals and strategy articulated in its revised Statement on LongerRun Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy.
"  Participants agreed that monetary policy was providing substantial accommodation, and most concurred that, with the federal funds rate at the ELB, much of that accommodation was due to the Committee’s forward guidance and increases in securities holdings."
" They judged that the current stance of monetary policy remained appropriate, as both employment and inflation remained well short of the Committee’s goals and the uncertainty about the course of the virus and the outlook for the economy continued to be very elevated."
"Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that the COVID19 pandemic was causing tremendous human and economic hardship across the United States and around the world."
" They noted that economic activity and employment had continued to recover but remained  well below their levels at the beginning of the year, and that weaker demand and earlier declines in oil prices had been holding down consumer price inflation."
" In addition, members agreed that the ongoing public health crisis would continue to weigh on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term and was posing considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term."
"  All members reaffirmed that, in accordance with the Committee’s goals to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run and with inflation running pers istently below this longerrun goal, they would aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longerterm inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent."
 Members expected to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until those outcomes were achieved.
" All members agreed to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent, and they expected that it would be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions had reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assess ments of maximum employment and inflation had risen to 2 percent and was on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time."
"Members agreed that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and that they would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate in the event that risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals."
" Members also agreed that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments."
" Engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve’s agency MBS transactions.” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2:00 p.m.: “The Federal Reserve is committed to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time , thereby promoting its maximum employment and price stability goals."
