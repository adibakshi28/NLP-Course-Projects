" Regarding international developments, yields in most advanced foreign economies (AFEs) also rose sharply as a number of other central banks lifted policy rates and indicated in their communications that they would likely continue to tighten monetary policy in order to address inflation pressures."
" The markets for Treasury securities and agency MBS continued to function in an orderly manner, though liquidity cond itions in both markets remained low, reflecting elevated interest rate uncertainty."
" Amid strong demand for shortterm investments, takeup at the overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) facility was relatively steady at elevated levels."
" Issuance of shortterm securities was likely to increase in coming periods, and, as more clarity emerged in the economic and policy outlook, demand for shortterm assets could moderate."
" Labor demand remained strong, and the labor market continued to be very tight."
 Recent monthly readings indicated that consumer price inflation—as measured by the 12month percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE)—remained elevated.
Total nonfarm payroll employment posted robust gains in July and August at an average pace that was only slightly below what was seen over the first half of the year.
" The unemployment rate edged up, on net, from 3.6 percent in June to 3.7 percent in August."
" The unemployment rate for African Americans increased over this period, while the rate for Hispanics moved up slightly on net; both rates were noticeably higher than the national average."
" The labor force participation rate and  employmentto-population ratio both rose, on net, from June to August."
" Nominal wage growth continued to be rapid and broad based:  Aver age hourly earnings rose 5.2 percent over the 12 months ending in August, while the employment cost index of hourly compensation in the private sector, which also includes benefit costs, rose 5.5 percent over the 12 months ending in June, 2.4 percentage points faster than the yearearlier pace."
Consumer price inflation rema ined elevated.
" Total PCE price inflation was 6.3 percent over the 12 months ending in July, and core PCE pr ice inflation, which excludes changes in consumer energy prices and many consumer food prices, was 4.6 percent over the same period."
 The trimmed mean measure of 12month PCE price inflation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas was 4.4 percent in July.
" In August, the 12month change in the consumer price index (CPI) was 8.3 percent, while core CPI inflation was 6.3 percent over the same period."
" Surveybased measures of shortrun inflation expectations declined in recent weeks, while measures of longerterm inflation expectations remained roughly stable or moved lower."
 The nominal U.S. international trade deficit continued to narrow in June and July.
" Altogether, net exports contributed positively to GDP growth in the second quarter and appeared on track to make another positive contribution in the third quarter."
"Data pointed to weak foreign growth in recent months, weighed down by the global reverberations from Russia’s war against Ukraine and a loss of momentum in the Chinese economy."
" In Europe, further disruptions to the supply of energy exacerbated declines in real disposable incomes and in consumer and business confidence, restraining economic activity."
 Weaker growth in China and the broader global economy also weighed on exportoriented emerging market economies in Asia.
" Consumer price inflation rose further in August in many foreign economies, reflecting past increases in energy and food prices, but also a continued broadening of inflationary pressure to core prices."
" With inflation persistently high, many central banks continued to tighten monetary policy."
" Credit remained widely available to most types of borrowers, but increases in borrowing costs appeared to damp the demand for credit in some markets in recent months."
" The expected path of the federal funds rate—implied by a straight read of financial market quotes—rose in the period since the July FOMC meeting, largely reflecting Page 4Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________   morerestrictive-thanexpected monetary policy communications amid stronger -thanexpected economic data and ongoing concerns about high inflation."
" The increases in nominal Treasury yields were primarily accounted for by rising real yields, while inflation compen sation measures declined substantially at short horizons and remained relatively little changed at mediumand longerterm horizons."
"Broad equity price indexes decreased slightly, on net, as substantial early gains arising from investors’ improved perceptions about the inflation outlook and betterthan-feared secondquarter earnings were more than offset by later losses arising from expectations that the Committee would follow a more restrict ive policy than previously expected."
" Onemonth optionimplied volatility on the S&P 500—the VIX—increased somewhat, on net, and remained elevated by historical norms, partly reflecting investor uncertainty and risks associated with higher inflation and the expected move to a restrictive policy stance."
"Conditions in shortterm fu nding markets remained stable over the intermeeting period, with the July increase in the Federal Reserve’s admi nistered interest rates passing through quickly to other money market rates."
" Although secured overnight rates firmed slightly later in the intermeeting period, they remained soft relative to the ON RRP offering rate—a configuration that market participants attributed to rel atively low Treasury bill supply combined with strong investor demand for shortdated instruments amid uncertainty about the future path of the policy rate."
Sovereign yields in most AFEs rose notably over the intermeeting period as major central banks raised their policy rates and communicated a tighter stance of future policy in the face of persistent inflationary pressures.
" Yields on Japanese government securities, however, ended the period little changed, as the Bank of Japan reaffirmed its accommodative monetary policy stance."
 Measures of foreign inflation compensation were volatile amid large swings in European natural gas prices but increased moderately on net.
 The dollar’s strength largely reflected increasing investor concerns about the global growth outlook as well as widening interest rate differentials between the United States and Japan.
" Growth concerns also weighed on foreign equity prices, which declined moderately."
 Bank interest rates for commercial and industrial (C&I) and commercial real estate (CRE) loans also increased.
" Interest rates on most credit card accounts continued to move higher, in line with the rise in the federal funds rate, and auto loan interest rates rose steadily through August."
"Credit remained generally available to businesses and households, but high borrowing costs appeared to reduce the demand for credit, resulting in lower financing volumes in some markets."
"According to the July Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices, banks tightened credit standards on C&I lending for the first time in two years, but C&I loans on banks’ balance sheets expanded at a strong pace in July and August , reflecting strong demand from nonfinancial businesses."
Staff Economic Outlook The projection for U.S. economic activity prepared by the staff for the September FOMC meeting was slightly weaker than the July forecast.
" However, the staff’s estimate of potential output in recent history was revised down significantly in response to continued disappointing productivity growth and the sluggish gains in labor force participation seen so far this year; moreover, this lower trajectory for potential output was expected to persist throughout the forecast period."
" Likewise, the unemployment rate was expected to rise more slowly than in the July projection and to be slightly below the staff’s estima te of its natural rate at the end of 2025."
"On a 12month change basis, total PCE price inflation was expected to be 5.1 perc ent in 2022, and core inflation was expected to be 4.3 percent."
 Although the staff continued to project that core  inflation would step down over the next two years—reflecting the anticipated resolution of supply–demand imbalances and a labor market that was expected to become less tight—core inflation was revised up in each year of the projection.
" In 2025, core inflation was expected to be 2.1 percent."
 Total PCE price inflation was expected to decline to 2.6 percent in 2023 as core inflation slowed and energy prices declined.
" Total PCE inflation was expected to move down further in 2024, to 2 percent, and to remain at 2 percent in 2025."
" In addition to Russia’s war in Ukraine, weakening activity abroad, and ongoing supply chain bottlenecks, the possibility that a persistent reduction in inflation could require a greaterthan-assumed amount of tightening in financial conditions was viewed by the staff as a salient downside risk to their forecast for real activity."
 The staff also pointed to the possibility that wage increases could put a greaterthan-expected amount of upward pressure on price inflation and the possibility that inflati on expectations could become unanchored given the la rge rise in inflation seen over the past year as additional upside risks to the inflation forecast.
"Page 6Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________   Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2022 through 2025 and over the longer run, based on their individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy, including the path of the federal funds rate."
" The longerrun projections represented each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy."
"In their discussion of current economic conditions, participants noted that recent indicators had pointed to modest growth in spending and production."
" Job gains had been robust in recent months, and the unemployment rate had remained low."
" Inflation remained elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher food and energy prices, and broader price pressures."
 Participants judged that the war and related events were creating additional upward pressure on inflation and were weighing on global economic activity.
" Against this background, participants remained highly attentive to inflation risks."
"With regard to the economic outlook, participants noted that recent data pointed to modest growth in economic activity over the second half of this year."
 Participants revised down their projections of real GDP growth for this year from their projections in June.
" Several participants noted that the continued strength in the labor market, as well as the data on gross domestic income, raised the possibility that the current GDP data could understate the strength in economic activity this year."
" Participants generally anticipated that the U.S. economy would grow at a belowtrend pace in this and the coming few years, with the labor market becoming less tight, as monetary policy assumed a restrictive stance and global headwinds persisted."
 Participants noted that a period of belowtrend real GDP growth would help reduce inflationary pressures and set the stage for the sustained achievement of the Committee’s objectives of maximum employment and price stability.
" Participants observed that the notable slowdown in residential investment and other interestsensitive spending had continued, reflecting the effect of the Committee’s monetary policy actions and tighter financial conditions."
"With regard to the business sector, participants observed that growth in investment spending appeared modest."
"Participants observed that the labor market had remained very tight, as eviden ced by a historically low unemployment rate, elevated job vacancies and quit rates, a low pace of layoffs, robust employment gains, and high nominal wage growth."
" Some participants noted a number of developments consistent with the labor market moving toward better balance, including a lower rate of job turnover, a moderation in employment growth, and an increase in the labor force participation rate for primeage workers."
" Participants anticipated that the supply and demand imbalances in the labor market  would gradually diminish and the unemployment rate would likely rise somewhat, importantly reflecting the effects of tighter monetary policy."
 Participants expected that the transition toward a softer labor market would be accompanied by an increase in the unemployment rate.
" A couple of participants remarked that, in light of challenges in hiring, businesses might be less willing to reduce their staffing levels in the event of a weakening in general economic activity."
 A few participants particularly stressed the high uncertainty associated with the expected future path of the unemployment rate and commented that the unemployment rate could rise by considerably more than in the staff forecast.
Participants observed that inflation remained unacceptably high and well above the Committee’s longerrun goal of 2 percent.
" Participants commented that recent inflation data generally had come in above expectations and that, correspondingly, in flation was declining more slowly than they had previously  been anticipating."
 Participants comm ented that they expected inflation pressures to persist in the near term.
"  With respect to the medium term, participants judged that inflation pressures would gradually recede in coming years."
" Various factors were cited as likely to contribute to this outcome, including the Committee’s tightening of its policy stance, a gradual easing of supply and demand imbalances in labor and product markets, and the likelihood that weaker consumer demand would result in a reduction of business profit margins from their current elevated levels."
" Several participants commented that while households across the income distribution were burdened by elevated inflation, those at the lower end of the income distribution were particularly harmed, as a larger share of their income was spent on housing and other necessities."
"In assessing inflation expectations, participants noted that longerterm expectations appeared to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters as well as measures obtained from financ ial markets."
" Participants remarked that the Committee’s affirmation of its strong commitment to its pricestability objective, together with its forceful policy actions, had likely helped keep longerrun inflation expectations anchored."
" Some stressed that a more prolonged period of elevated inflation would increase the risk of inflation expectations becoming unanchored, making it much more  costly to bring inflation down."
" A few participants discussed the increased dispersion of longerterm inflation expectations across respondents in various surveys, with an increase in the number of respondents reporting relatively low expectations of future inflation acknow ledged as a key driver of the increased dispersion but with a couple of participants citing higher inflation expectations among some survey respondents as a cause for concern and a reason not to be complacent about longer -term inflation expectations remaining well anchored."
Participants agreed that the uncertainty associated with their economic outlooks was hi gh and that risks to their inflation outlook were weighted to the upside.
" Some participants noted rising labor tensions, a new round of global energy price increases,  further disruptions in supply chains, and a largerthan-expected passthrough of wage increases into price in creases as potential shocks that, if they materialized, could compound an already challenging inflation problem."
"  Page 8Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________   Participants broadly judged the risks to real GDP growth to be weighted to the downside, with various global headwinds most prominently cited as contributing factors."
" These global headwind s included heightened risk of recession in Europe, a slowdown in economic activity occurring in China, and the ongoing global economic implications of Russia’s war against Ukraine."
" Several participants noted that the monetary policy tightening under way in many other economies would affect global financial markets and foreign real GDP growth, with the potential for spillovers to the U.S. economy."
"In their consideration of the appropriate stance of monetary policy, participants concurred that the labor market was very tight and that inflation was far above the Committee’s 2 percent inflation objective."
" Participants observed that recent indicators of production and spending had pointed to modest growth, while job gains had been robust and the unemployment rate had remained low."
 Policymakers observed that the rate hike at this meeting was another step toward making the Committee’s monetary policy stance sufficiently restrictive to help ease supply an d demand imbalances and to bring inflation back to 2 percent.
" Participants reaffirmed their strong commitment to returning inflation to the Committee’s 2 percent objective, with many stressing the importance of staying on this course even as the labor market slowed."
" Participants judged that the Committee needed to move to, and then maintain, a more restrictive policy stance in order to meet the Committee’s legislative mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability."
" Many participants noted that, with inflation well above the Committee’s 2 percent objective and showing little sign so far of abating, and with supply and demand imbalances in the economy continuing, they had raised their assessment of the path of the federal funds rate that would likely be needed to achieve the Committee’s goals."
 Participants judged that the pace and extent of policy rate increases would continue to depend on the implications of incoming information for the outlook for economic activity and inflation and on risks to the outlook.
" Participants observed that, as the stance of monetary policy tightened further, it would become appropriate at some point to slow the pace of policy rate increases while assessing the effects of cumulative policy adjustments on economic activity an d inflation."
" Many participants indicated that, once the policy rate had reached a sufficiently restrictive level,  it likely would be appropriate to maintain that level for some time until there was compelling evidence that inflation was on course to return to the 2 percent objective."
"In their assessment of the effects of policy actions and communications to date, participants concurred that the Committee’s actions to raise expeditiously the target range for the federal funds rate demonstrated its resolve to lower inflation to 2 percent and to keep inflation expectations anchored at levels consistent with that longerrun goal."
" Participants noted that the Committee’s commitment to restoring price stability, together with its purposeful policy actions and communications, had contributed to a notable tightening of financial conditions over the past year that would likely help reduce inflation pressures by restraining aggr egate demand."
 Participants observed that this tightening had led to substantial increases in real interest rates across the maturity spectrum.
" Most participants remarked that, although some interestsensitive categories  of spending—such as housing and business fixed investment—had already started to respond to the tightening of financial conditions, a sizable portion of economic activity had yet to display much response."
" They noted also that inflation had not yet responded appreciably to policy tightening and that a significant reduction in in flation would likely lag that Minutes of the Meeting of September 20–21, 2022Page 9_____________________________________________________________________________________________   of aggregate demand."
" Participants observed that a period of real GDP growth below its trend rate, very likely accompanied by some softening in labor market conditions, was required."
" They agreed that, by moving its policy purposefully toward an appropriately restrictive stance, the Committee would help ensure that elevated inflation did not become entrenched and that inflation expectations did not become unanchored."
" These policy moves would therefore prevent the far greater economic pain associated with entrenched high inflation, including the even tighter policy and more severe restraint on economic activity that would then be needed to restore price stability."
"In light of the broadbased and unacceptably high level of inflation, the intermeeting news of higherthan- expected inflation, and upside risks to the inflation outlook, participants remarked th at purposefully moving to a restrictive policy stance in th e near term was consistent with riskmanagement considerations."
 Many participants emphasized that the cost of taking too little action to bring down inflation likely outweighed the cost of taking too much action.
" Several participants underlined the need to maintain a restrictive stance for as long as necessary, with a couple of these participants stressing that historical experience demonstrated the danger of prematurely ending periods of tight monetary policy designed to bring down inflation."
" Several participants observed that as policy moved into restrictive territory, risks would become more twosided, reflecting the emergence of the downside risk that the cumulative restraint in aggregate demand would exceed what was required to bring inflation back to 2 percent."
" A few of these participants noted that this possib ility was heightened by factors beyond the Committee’s actions, including the tightening of monetary policy stances abroad and the weakening global economic outlook, that were also likely to restrain domestic economic activity in the period ahead."
"Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that recent indicators had pointed to modest growth in spending and production."
 Members also concurred that job gains had been robust in recent months and the unemployment rate had remained low.
" Members agreed that inflation remained elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher food and energy prices, and broader price pressures."
