"Tetlow , Senior Adviser s, Division of Monetary Affairs, Board of Governors   3 Attended through the discussion of the review of the monetary policy framework."
" 6 Attended through the discussion of developments in financial markets and open market operations, and from the discussion of current monetary policy through the end of the meeting."
"Tallarini, Jr., Assistant Vice President, Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis   Karel Mertens,3 Senior Economic Policy Advisor, Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas   Daniel Cooper, Senior Economist and Policy Advisor, Federal Reserve Bank of Boston   Scott Davis, Senior Research Economist and Advisor, Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas   Julie Hotchkis s,3 Research Economist and Senior Advisor, Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta   Review of Monetary Policy Strategy, Tools, and Communication Practices  Participants continued to discuss issues related to the ongoing review of the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy strategy, tools, and communication practices."
 These even ts engaged with the public directly on issues pertaining to the dual -mandate objectives of maximum employment and stable prices.
 Inflation developments elicited fewer comments at these events and were generally seen as posing less of a challenge than labor market conditions.
 Business representatives emphasized the importance of low  and stable inflation for planning and decisionmaking.
 Event participants were concerned about rising costs of living and generally perceived low inflation as desirable from that perspective.
 Even t participants were asked about monetary policymakers’ concerns regarding overall inflation running persistently below 2 percent; they noted that the Federal Reserve could better communicate its reasons for these concerns.
" When asked about the effects of changes in interest rates, representatives of underserved communities said that such changes had little effect on many members of their communities who have limited or no access to credit."
" Representatives of retirees conveyed a more negative view of low interest rates , given the greater reliance of wealthier retirees on interest income."
 Business representatives generally found the low interest rate environment beneficial.
 The staff used  simulations from a specific  macroeconomic model to explore how heterogeneity of households might affect the transmission of economic shocks and changes in monetary policy to the economy.
" As a result, i n these simulations, downturns lead to larger contractions in aggregate demand than would be the case if all households could borrow to support their consumption spending in response to a loss in income."
 The amplification of recessionary shocks was especially large when the monetary policy response was constrained by the effective lower bound (ELB) on the policy interest rate.
Participants agreed that the Fed Listens  outreach efforts had informed their understanding of the goals and tradeoffs associated with monetary policy  and had provided highly  useful input into their deliberations.
"  Participants generally saw the feedback from Fed Listens  events as reinforcing the importance of sustaining the economic expansion so that the effects of a persistently strong job market reach more of those who, in the past, had experienced difficulty finding employment."
 Several participants mentioned that sustaining strong labor market conditions helps workers build skills and cement their attachment to the labor force in a manner that might reduce the scarring effects of future downturns and might increase the maximum sustainable level of employment over the longer run.
  A number of  participants also emphasized that sustaining strong labor market conditions is helpful for  meeting the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent inflation goal.
 Some participants  spoke to some of the challenges associated with assessing the maximum level of employment.
 A few others pointed to the continued absence of  significant wage and price pressure—traditionally seen as a symptom of a tight labor market—even as the unemployment rate had moved below most estimates of its longer -run level.
" A few participants raised the possibility that the maximum sustainable level of employment had Minutes of the Meeting of December 10–11, 2019Page 3_____________________________________________________________________________________________  increased as the expansion continued to draw workers who would otherwise not be in the labor force."
" Regarding inflation, participants recognized that segments of the public generally do not regard the fact that aggregate inflation is running modestly below the Committee’s 2  percent goal as a problem."
 A few participants  noted that the public’s view  on this issue was understandable from the perspective of households and businesses going about their daily lives in an economy with low and stable inflation .
" That said, a couple of participants cautioned that inflation could emerge as a concern among members of the public if it became more volatile or ran at levels substantially away from the Committee’s goal."
" In particular, if inflation ran persistently below the Committee’s objective, longer -term inflation expectations could drift down, resulting in lower actual inflation."
" With lower inflation, nominal interest rates would be lower as well and therefore closer to the ELB."
" As a result, the scope for monetary policy to support the economy in a future downturn through interest rate cuts would be reduced, a situation that would likely worsen economic outcomes for households and businesses."
" In light of these considerations, participants generally agreed that they need to communicate more clearly to the public their rationale for, and commitment to, achieving  2 percent inflation  on a sustained basis and of ensuring that longer -run inflation expectations are anchored at levels consistent with this objective."
 A few participants emphasized that communications about the Committee’s resolve to return inflation to 2 percent need to be backed with actions and results to ensure that the public sees these communications as credible.
" With respect to the role of distributional considerations in the pursuit of the dual -mandate objectives, several participants noted that it was important for policymakers to be cognizant of how monetary policy affects different segments of the population."
" Most participants commented on the large costs that recessions and high unemployment impose on communities, notably on their most vulnerable constituents, and stressed the need for monetary policy to seek to avoid recessions in the first place or  reduce their severity when they occur."
" A number of these participants emphasized that, while monetary policy actions can have different effects across groups, monetary policy actions that are driven by the pursuit of maximum employment and stable prices ultimately benefit all groups."
" Participants viewed the role of monetary policy as supporting a strong, stable economy that benefits all Americans."
 Various participants noted that monetary policy is a blunt instrument whose effects cannot be targeted to specific communities.
" Several participants remarked that while monetary policy actions can improve the conditions  of vulnerable communities, notably by supporting a strong job market, these actions may not reduce inequality in wealth and income."
" For these and other reasons, many participants emphasized that policies other than monetary policy are appropriate to directly address inequality."
" Participants agreed that their review of monetary policy strategy, tools, and communication practices would continue at future meetings and, as a result, that the Committee would not reaffirm its existing Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy at the January 2020 meeting."
" Regarding expectations  for U.S. monetary policy, the Open Market Trading Desk’s surveys and marketbased indicators pointed to a very high perceived likelihood of no change in the target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting."
" Survey - and marketimplied uncertainty about the near -term outlook for monetary policy declined, with market commentary attributing the decrease in part to the Committee’s October communications."
" Money market rates are often volatile around year -end, and Federal Reserve operations are not intended to eliminate all year -end pressures but rather to ensure that reserve supply remains ample and to mitigate the risk that such pressures could adversely affect the implementation of monetary policy."
 Purchases of these short -dated securities would  not affect broader financial conditions or the stance of monetary policy.
" Consumer price inflation, as measured by the 12 -month percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), remained below 2 percent in October."
" Total nonfarm payroll employment surged in November, boosted in part by the return of auto workers who had previously been on strike in October."
" However, the rate of increase in payrolls so far this year was slower than last year, even accounting for the anticipated effects of the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ benchmark revis ion to payroll employment, which will be incorporated in the published data in February 2020."
" The unemployment rate ticked up in October but then moved back down to its 50 -year low Minutes of the Meeting of December 10–11, 2019Page 5_____________________________________________________________________________________________  of 3.5 percent in November; the labor force participation rate and the employment -topopulation ratio held steady, on balance, over those two months."
" The unemployment rates for African Americans, Asians, Hispanics, and whites were little changed, on net, over the past two months; the unemployment rate for each group was below its level at the end of the previous economic expansion, though persistent differentials between these rates remained."
 The four -week moving average of initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits through late November remained near historically low levels.
" In general, recent measures of nominal wage growth continued to be moderate."
" The employment cost index  for private -sector workers rose 2.7  percent over the 12 months ending in September, while average hourly earnings for all employees increased 3.1 percent over the 12 months ending in November."
" Core PCE price inflation (which excludes changes in consumer food and energy prices) was 1.6 percent over that same 12 -month period, while consumer food price inflation was lower than core inflation and consumer energy prices declined."
 The trimmed mean measure of 12 -month PCE price inflation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas remained at 2 percent in October.
" The consumer price index (CPI) rose 2.1 percent over the 12 months ending in November, while core CPI inflation was 2.3 percent."
" Recent readings on surveybased measures of longer -run inflation expectations —including those from the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers, the Survey of Professional Forecasters, the  Survey of Consumer Expectations from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and the Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants —were little changed , on balance; the Michigan survey measure ticked back down in early December to the bo ttom of its recent range after ticking up in November."
" Key factors that influence consumer spending —includ ing the low unemployment rate, the upward trend in real disposable income, high levels of households’ net worth, and generally low interest rates —were supportive of solid real PCE growth in the near term."
" Most measures of business sentiment were still downbeat, analysts’ expectations of firms’ longer -term profit growth edged down further , and concerns about trade developments continued to weigh on firms’ investment decisions."
" Overall manufacturing production appeared likely to remain soft in coming months, reflecting generally weak readings on new orders from national and regional manufacturing surveys, declining domestic business investment, slow economic growth abroad, and a persistent drag from trade developments."
The nominal U.S. international trade deficit narrowed in October.
" Available trade data suggested that the contribution of net exports to real GDP growth, which was slightly negative in the third quarter, would turn somewhat positive in the fourth quarter."
 Foreign economic growth slowed further in the third quarter amid continued weakness in the global manufacturing sector.
 Recent monthly indicators pointed to a stabilization in the pace of economic growth in China and several advanced foreign economies.
" However, other indicators suggested that social unrest weighed heavily on economic activity in several countries, most notably in Hong Kong, and that weakness persisted in parts of Latin America."
" Foreign inflation picked up somewhat as energy prices stabilized, although inflation remained relatively low in most foreign economies."
 Financing conditions for businesses and households remained supportive of spending and economic activity.
 Measures of inflation compensation over the next 5 years and 5 to 10 years ahead based on Treasury Inflation -Protected Securities increased slightly from near multiyear low levels.
 Broad stock price indexes increased moderately over the intermeeting period amid movements largely attributed to trad erelated developments and stronger -thanexpected U.S. employment reports.
 Interest rates for overnight secured and unsecured loans fell in line with the 25 basis point decrease in the target range for the federal funds rate at the October F OMC meeting.
  CRE loan growth at banks also increased in October relative to recent quarters.
"    Financing conditions in consumer credit markets remained generally supportive of growth in consumer spending, although conditions continued to be tight for nonprime borrowers."
" Auto loans increased, consistent with significant declines in auto loan interest rates this year."
" Credit card debt grew at a solid pace, and interest rates on credit card debt began to fall."
 Staff Economic Outlook  The projection for U.S. rea l GDP growth prepared by the staff for the December FOMC meeting was revised up a little for the second half of 2019 relative to the previous projection.
" The forecast for real GDP growth over the medium term was also revised up a bit, on balance, primarily in response to a somewhat higher  projected path for equity prices."
" Nevertheless, real GDP growth was still expected to slow modestly in the co ming years, largely because of a fading boost from fiscal policy."
 Output was forecast to expand at a rate a little above the staff’s estimate of its potential rate of growth in 2019 through 2021 and then to slow to a pace slightly below potential output growth in 2022.
 The unemployment rate was projected to be roughly flat at around its current level through 2022 and to remain below the staff’s estimate of its longer -run natural rate.
"  The staff’s forecast for total PCE price inflation in 2019 was revised down a bit, as a downward revision to core PCE prices in response to recent data was partly offset by an upward revision to consumer energy prices."
" Beyond 2019, core inflation was expected to be above its pace this year, and this projection was revised up a touch because of the slightly tighter resource utilization in the current forecast."
 The projection for total inflation in 2020 was a little lower than for core inflation due to a projected decline in consumer energy prices.
" Over the remainder o f the mediumterm projection, total inflation was expected to be about the same as core inflation, al -though both inflation measures were forecast to continue to run a bit below 2 percent through 2022."
" The staff continued to view the uncertainty around  its projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as generally similar to the average of the past 20 years."
" The staff viewed the downside risks to economic activity as having eased a bit since the previous forecast but still judge d that the risks to the forecast for real GDP growth were tilted to the downside, with a corresponding skew to the upside for the unemployment rate."
" In addition, softness in business investment and manufacturing production so far this year were seen as pointing to the possibility of a more substantial slowing in economic growth than the staff projected."
" The risks to the inflation projection were also viewed as having a downward skew, in part because of the downside risks to the forecast for  economic activity."
" Participants ’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook  In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, members of the Board of Governors and Federal Reserve Bank presidents submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes  for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2019 through 2022 and over the longer run, based on their individual assessments of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate."
" The longer -run projections represented each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy."
 Participants agreed that the labor market had remained strong over the intermeeting period and that economic activity had risen at a moderate rate.
" Job gains had been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate had remained low."
" On a  12month basis, overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy were running below 2 percent."
 Marketbased measures of inflation compensation remained low; survey -based measures of longer -term inflation expectations were little changed.
" Participants generally expected sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective  as the most likely outcomes ."
" This outlook reflected, at least in part, the support provided by the current stance of monetary policy."
" Nevertheless, global develop ments, related to both persistent uncertainty regarding international  trade and weakness in economic growth abroad, continued to pose some risks to the outlook, and inflation pressures remained muted."
 Many participants commented that business contacts in consumer -related industries reported strong demand or that contacts were optimistic about the holiday retail spending season.
"With respect to the business sector, participants saw trade developments and concerns about the global economic growth outlook as the main factors contributing to weak business investment and exports."
  A few participants noted that the current weakness in capital expenditures could  lead to a slower pace of productivity growth in future years.
" Several participants noted that the agricultural sector also f aced a number of difficulties, including those associated with trade developments, weak export demand, and challenging financial positions for many farmers."
" Participants judged that conditions in the labor market remained strong, with the unemployment rate at a  50year low, job gains remaining solid, and some measures of labor force participation increasing fu rther."
" The unemployment rate was likely to remain low going forward, and various participants remarked that there were some indications that further strengthening in overall labor market conditions was possible without creating undesirable pressures on resources."
" Moreover, measures of wage growth had generally remained moderate."
" In addition, a couple  of participants remarked that the preliminary benchmark revision released in August by the Bureau of Labor Statistics had indicated that payroll employment gains would likely show less momentum coming into this year once those revisions are incorporated in published data early next year."
" Business contacts in many Districts indicated continued strong labor demand, with firms reporting difficulties in finding qualified workers or broadening their recruiting to include traditionally marginalized groups."
"   In their discussion of inflation developments, participants noted that recent readings on overall and core PCE inflation, measured on a 12month change basis, had continued to run below 2 percent."
" Surveybased Minutes of the Meeting of December 10–11, 2019Page 9_____________________________________________________________________________________________  measures of longer -term inflation expectations were little changed , and marketbased measures of inflation compensation remained low."
 A few participants commented on factors  that may temporarily exert upward pressure on some measures of inflation in the coming months.
" Assessing all  these factors, participants generally expected that inflation would return to the 2 percent objective as the economic expansion continued and r esource utilization remained high."
" However, weakness abroad and subdued global inflation pressures were cited as sources of risk to this assessment."
 Participants who  expressed less confidence that inflation would return promptly to the 2 percent objective commented that inflation had averaged less than 2 percent over the past several years even as resource utilization had increased  or that global or technology -related factors  were exerting downward pressure on inflation that could be difficult to overcome.
  Participants also discussed risks regarding the outlook for economic activity.
" In addition, there were indications that the prospects for global economic growth may be stabilizing."
" In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, participants  judged that it would be appropriate to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1 ½ to 1¾ percent to support sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective."
" As reflected in their SEP projections, participants regarded the current stance of monetary policy as  likely to remain appropriate for a time as long as incoming information about the economy remained broadly consistent with the economic outlook ."
     A number of  participants agreed that maintaining the current stance of monetary policy would give the Committee some time to assess the full effects on the economy of its policy decisions and communications over the course of this year  along with other information bearing on the economic outlook .
 Participants also discussed how maintaining the current stance of policy for a time could be helpful for cushion ing the economy from the global developments that have been weighing on economic activity and  for returning inflation to the Committee’s symmetric objective of 2 percent .
 Participants generally expressed concerns regarding inflation continuing to fall short of 2 percent.
" Although  a number of participants noted that some of the factors currently holding down inflation were likely to prove transitory, various  participants were concerned  that indicators were suggesting that the level  of long erterm inflation expectations was  too low."
" A few participants raised the concern that keeping interest rates low over a long period might encourage excessive risktaking, which could exacerbate imbalances in the financial sector."
 These participants offered various perspectives on the relationship between financial stability and policies that keep interest rates persistently low.
" They  remark ed that such policies could be inconsistent with sustaining  maximum employment, could make the next recession more severe than otherwise, or could strengthen the case for the active use of macroprudential tools  to guard against emerging imbalances ."
"Various  participants remarked on issues related to the implementation of monetary policy, highlighting topics for further discussion at future meetings."
"  Committee Policy Action  In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, members noted that information received since the FOMC met in October indicated that the labor market remained strong and that economic activity had been rising at a moderate rate."
" Job gains had been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate had remained low."
" On a 12 -month basis, overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy were running below 2  percent."
 Marketbased measures of inflation compensation remained low;  Page 10Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________  survey -based measures of longer -term inflation expectations were little changed.
" Members judged that the current stance of monetary policy is appropriate to support sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective."
"  Members also agreed that, in determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee would assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective."
" And they concurred that this assessment would take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
" With regard to the postmeeting statement, members agreed to state that they judged that “the current stance of monetary policy is appropriate” to support the achievement of the Committee’s policy objectives."
 Members discussed their options regarding references to global developments and muted inflation pressures in the statement.
" Accordingly, they agreed to cite them in the sentence indicating that “the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook.”  With the retention of these references to global developments and muted inflation pressures, members agreed that the text on uncertainties about the outlook could be removed."
  A few members  suggested that the language stating that monetary policy would support inflation “near” 2 percent could be mis interpreted  as suggesting that policymakers were comfortable with inflation running below that level; they preferred language that referr ed to returning inflation  to the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent  objective.
 Other members thought that the reference to “near” 2 percent was intended to encompass modest deviations of inflation above and below 2 percent .
" The Committee also directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Minutes of the Meeting of December 10–11, 2019Page 11_____________________________________________________________________________________________  Reserve’s agency mortgagebacked securities transactions.”  The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00  p.m.: “Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in October indicates that the labor market remains strong and that economic activity has been rising at a moderate rate."
" Job gains have been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low."
" On a 12‑month basis, overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy are running below 2  percent."
 Marketbased measures of inflation compensation remain low; surveybased measures of longer -term inflation expectations are little changed.
" Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
" The Committee judges that the current stance of monetary policy is appropriate to support sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee’s symmetric 2  percent objective."
" The Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook, including global developments and muted inflation pressures, as it assesses the appropriate path of the target range for the federal funds rate."
"In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2  percent inflation objective."
" This assessment will take into a ccount a wide range ofinformation, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.”  Voting for this action:   Jerome H."
" Consistent with the Committee’s decision to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the Board of Governors voted unanimously to leave the interest rates on required and excess reserve balances unchanged at 1.55  percent and voted unanimously to approve establishment of the primary credit rate at the existing level of 2.25 percent, effective December  12, 2019."
"Clouse  Secretary Page 12Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________  Summary of Economic Projections   In conjunction with the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting held on December 10 –11, 2019, meeting participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real gross domestic product (GDP) growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2019 to 2022 and over the longer run."
" Each participant’s projections were based on information available at the time of the meeting, together with his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy—including a path for the federal funds rate and its longer -run value— and assumptions about other factors likely to affect econ omic outcomes."
" The longer -run projections represent each participant’s assessment of the value to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy.1  “Appropriate monetary policy” is defined as the future path of policy that each participant deems most likely to foster outcomes for economic activity and inflation that best satisfy his or her individual interpretation of the statutory mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability."
"  Almost all  participants expected that, under appropriate monetary policy, growth of real GDP in 2020 would run at or slightly  above 1.9 percent , the median of current estimates of its longerrun rate."
" The median of the projections for the growth rate of real GDP edge s down each year over the projection horizon and, for 2022,  is modestly below the median of the current estimates of its longer -run rate."
" The median of the current projections for the unemployment rate was lower than that in the September Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) for each year of the projection period, and some participants reduced their estimates of the longer -run normal rate of unemployment, resulting in a slight decline in the median estimate ."
" The median s of the projections for both total and core inflation, as measured by the four -quarter percent change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), increase significantly from 2019 to 2020 and more modestly in 2021 to reach 2 percent that year ."
 Almost all  participants expected that inflation would be at or slightly above the Committee’s 2 percent objective in 2021 and 2022.
" A couple more participants , relative to the September SEP, projected inflation to exceed 2 percent at some point                                                             1 One participant did not submit longer -run projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, or the federal funds rate."
" The medians of the projections  for both total and core inflation were unchanged  for 2020 through 2022, compared with  the September SEP."
" As shown in figure 2, a substantial  majority of participants indicated that their expectations regarding the evolution of the economy, relative to the Committee’s objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation, would likely warrant keeping the federal funds at its current level through the end of 2020."
 T he majority of participants continued to assess the risks to their outlooks for real GDP growth as weighted to the downside and for the unemployment rate as weighted to the upside.
" Most participants  judged the risks to their  inflation outlook as broadly balanced , though one -third of  participants viewed the risks to their inflation projection s as weighted to the downside; no participant assessed the risks to his or her inflation outlook  as weighted to the upside."
 The uncertainties and risks around participants ’ projections for headline and core inflation were little changed from the September  SEP.
" The Outlook for Real GDP Growth and Unemployment  As shown in table 1, the medians of participants’ projections for real GDP growth  in 2019 and 2020, conditional on their individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy, were 2.2 percent and  2.0 percent , respectively, a touch above the median estimate of the longer -run Page 1_____________________________________________________________________________________________Table1."

" The median of the projections for the growth rate of real GDP declines slowly over the projection horizon and , in 2022, is modestly below the median of the current estimates of its longer -run rate."
" The medians of the projections for real GDP growth in all four years of the projection period , as well as in the longer run , were unchanged from the September SEP."
" A majority of participants marked down their projections of the unemployment rate in each year of  the projection period, and some participan ts lowered their estimates of the longer -run normal rate of unemployment."
"  As a result, t he medians of the projections for the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of 20 20 through 2022 were  3.5 percent, 3.6 percent, and 3.7 percent, respectively, each 0.2 percentage point lower than in the September  projections ."
" The median estimate of the longer -run normal rate of unemployment was 4 .1 percent, 0.1 percentage point lower than in September ."
"  Figures 3.A and 3.B show the distributions of participants’ projections for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate, respectively, from 2019 to 2022 and in the longer run."
" The distribution of individual projections for real GDP growth for 2020 tilted  slightly higher, as many participants  upgraded their projections  a bit relative to those  in the September SEP, although  the median projection was  unchanged ."
 The distributions of individual projections of real GDP growth in  2021 and 2022 and in  the longer run were little changed overall .
 The distributions of individual projections for the unemployment rate from 2020 to 2022 and in  the longer run shifted lower  relative to those in September .
"  The Outlook for Inflation  As shown in table 1, the median projection for core PCE price inflation was 1.6 percent for 2019, a modest decrease from the September  projections ."
 The medians of the projections for both total and core PCE price inflation were each 1.9 percent in 2020 and 2.0 percent in both 2021 and 2022—all unchanged from September .
 Figures 3.C and 3.D show the distributions of participants’ views about their  outlook s for inflation.
" Although the medians of the projections for total and core PCE price inflation from 2020 through  2022 were unchanged from the September  SEP, a couple more participants project ed inflation to be slightly above the Committee’s 2 percent objective in 2022."
  Appropriate Monetary Policy Figure 3.E shows the distributions of participants’ judgments regarding the appropriate target— or midpoint of the target range—for the federal funds rate at the end of each year from 2019 to 2022 and over the longer run.
 Realized inflation running persistently below target  and risks associated with trade policy and foreign economic growth were cited as key factors informing participants ’ judgments about the appropriate path for  the federal funds rate.
" As a reference, table 2 provides  measures of forecast uncertainty —based on the forecast errors of various private and government forecasts over the past 20 years —for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and total PCE price inflation."

" Participants’ assessments of the balance of risks to their current economic projections are shown in the bottom -right panels of figures 4.A, 4.B, and 4.C.  Relative to the September SEP, more participants saw the risks to the outlook for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate as broadly balanced,   although a small majority  continued  to view  the risks to their outlooks for real GDP growth as weighted to the downside and for the unemployment rate as weighted to the upside."
" Most participants  continued to judge the risks to their  inflation outlook as broadly balanced , while  some participants viewed the risks to their inflation  outlook  as weighted to the downside."
 N o participant assessed the risks to his or her inflation outlook  as weighted to the upside.
"  In discussing the uncertainty and risks surrounding their economic projections, some participants mentioned trade devel opments  and concerns about foreign economic growth  as sources of uncertainty or downside risk to the U.S. economic growth outlook."
" In contrast, the underlying strength of both consumer spending and the labor market was cited as balancing the risks around the growth outlook."
" In addition, most of the participants who shifted their balance of risks for output growth to “broadly balanced ” cited more accommodative monetary policy as a contributing factor ."
" For the inflation outlook, the possibility that inflation expectations could be drifting below levels consistent with the FOMC’s 2 percent inflation objective was viewed as a downside risk."
 A couple of participants mentioned higher tariffs as a source of upside risk to their inflation  outlook .
" Because the Committee adjusts the federal funds rate in response to actual and prospective developments over time in key economic variables —such as real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation—uncertainty surrounding the projected path for the federal funds rate importantly reflects the uncer tainties about the paths for these economic variables, along with other factors."

"The conﬁdence interval is not strictly consistent with theprojections for the federal funds rate, primarily because these projections are not forecasts of the likeliest outcomes forthe federal funds rate, but rather projections of participants’ individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy.Still, historical forecast errors provide a broad sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rategenerated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policythat may be appropriate to onset the eﬀects of shocks to the economy.The conﬁdence interval is assumed to be symmetric except when it is truncated at zero - the bottom of the lowesttarget range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted in the past by the Committee."
This truncation wouldnot be intended to indicate the likelihood of the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary policyaccommodation if doing so was judged appropriate.
"Because currentconditions may diﬀer from those that prevailed, on average, over the previous 20 years, the width and shape of theconﬁdence interval estimated on the basis of the historical forecast errors may not reﬂect FOMC participants’ currentassessments of the uncertainty and risks around their projections.* The conﬁdence interval is derived from forecasts of the average level of shortterm interest rates in the fourthquarter of the year indicated; more information about these data is available in table 2."
"The shaded area encompassesless than a 70 percent conﬁdence interval if the conﬁdence interval has been truncated at zero.Summary of Economic Projections of the Meeting of December 10–11, 2019Page 15_____________________________________________________________________________________________        Forecast Uncertainty The economic projections provided by the members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks inform discussions of monetary policy among policymakers and can aid public understanding of the basis for policy actions."
" Thus, in setting the stance of monetary policy, participants consider not only what appears to be the most likely economic outcome as embodied in their projections, but also the range of alternative possibilities, the likelihood of their occurring, and the potential costs to the economy should they occur."
" Table 2 summarizes the average historical accuracy of a range of forecasts, including those reported in past Monetary Policy Report s and those prepared by the Federal Rese rve Board’s staff in advance of meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)."
" The corresponding 70 percent confidence intervals for overall inflation would be 1.8 to 2.2  percent in the current year, 1.1 to 2.9  percent in the second year, 1.0 to 3.0 percent in the third year, and 1.1 to 2.9  percent in the fourth year ."
" Figures 4.A through 4.C illustrate these confidence bounds in “fan charts” that are symmetric and centered on the medians of FOMC participants’ projections for GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation."
" In particular, the unemployment rate cannot be negative; furthermore, the risks around a particular projection might be tilted to either the upside or the downside, in which case the corresponding fan chart would be asymmetrically positioned around the median projection."
" These judgments are summarized in the lower -right panel s of figures 4.A through 4.C.  As with real activity and inflation, the outlook for the future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable uncertainty."
 This uncertainty arises primarily because each participant ’s assessment of the appropriate stance of monetary policy depends importantly on the evolution of real activity and inflation over time.
 The final line in table  2 shows the error ranges for forecasts of short -term interest rates.
" It should be noted, however, that these confidence intervals are not strictly consistent with the projections for the federal funds rate, as these projections are not forecasts of the most likely quarterly outcomes but rather are projections of participants’ individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy and are on an end -ofyear basis."
" However, the forecast errors should provide a sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy that would be appropriate to offset the effects of shocks to the economy."
 This approach to the construction of the federal funds rate fan chart would be merely a convention; it would not have any implications for possible future policy decisions regarding the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so were appropriate .
