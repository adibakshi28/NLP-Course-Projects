Adjust somewhat in exceptional circumstances the stance of monetary policy and to take actions that may result in material changes in the composition and size of the assets in the SOMA; or  B.
"Any such adjustment described in subparagraph A of this paragraph 5 shall be made in the context of the Committee’s discussion and decision about the stance of policy at its mos t recent meeting and the Committee’s longrun objectives to foster maximum employment and price stability, and shall be based on economic, financial, and monetary developments since the most recent meeting of the Committee."

"At the end of the Committee’s annual disposition of organizational matters, participants considered a revised Statement on LongerRun Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy."
 The proposed revisions would clarify that the Committee viewed its 2 percent inflation goal as symmetric.
" In presenting the revised statement on behalf of the subcommittee on communications, Governor Fischer pointed out that, in a discussion of the statement in October 2014, participants had expressed widespread agreement that inflation moderately above the Committee’s 2 percent goal and inflation the same amount below that level were equally costly."
 He noted that the proposed language was intended to encompass situations in which deviations from the Committee’s inflation objective were expected to continue for a time and had the potential to affect longerterm inflation expectations.
" In addition to the explicit indication that the Committee viewed its inflation objective as symmetric, the revised statement would update the reference to participants’ estimates of the longerrun normal rate of unemployment from the most recent Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), using the median of those projections rather than the central tendency."
Participants noted that the statement reflects an exceptionally high degree of consensus and that the threshold for amendments should be high; they judged that the revisions were important because they would clarify the symmetry of the Committee’s 2 percent inflation objective and communicate to the public that the objective was not a ceiling.
" Participants also noted that the proposed new language indicating that the Committee would “be concerned if inflation were running persistently above or below” its 2 percent objective would not require that participants hold similar views about inflation dynamics ; in addition , the proposed language would not specify the stance of monetary policy in such circumstances but would afford the Committee appropriate flexibility in tailoring a policy response to persistent deviations from the inflation objective."
" Moreover, participants generally agreed that the proposed new languag e should be interpreted as applying to situations in which inflation was seen as likely to remain below or above 2 percent for a sustained period."
" However, one participant judged that the proposed language could be read as referring to current and past deviations from the inflation objective, and argued that the statement should more clearly indicate that the Committee’s policy decisions were based on expected future inflation."
" Participants agreed that it was appropriate to release the amended statement, which is reproduced below, in advance of the Monetary Policy Report  and testimony, which were scheduled for midFebruary."
" STATEMENT ON LONGERRUN GOALS AND MONETARY POLICY STRATEGY (As amended effective January 26, 2016) “The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is firmly committed to fulfilling its statutory mandate from the Congress of promoting maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate longterm interest rates."
 The Committee seeks to explain its monetary policy decisions to the public as clearly as possible.
" Such clarity facilitates wellinformed decisionmaking by households and businesses, reduces economic and financial uncertainty, increases the effectiveness of monetary policy, and enhances transparency and accountability, which are essential in a democratic society."
" Page 8Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________  Inflation, employment, and longterm interest rates fluctuate over time in response to economic and financial disturbances."
" Moreover, monetary policy actions tend to influence economic activity and prices with a lag."
" The inflation rate over the longer run is primarily determined by monetary policy, and hence the Committee has the ability to specify a longerrun goal for inflation."
" The Committee reaffirms its judgment that inflation at the rate of 2 percent, as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, is most consistent over the longer run with the Federal Reserve’s statutory mandate."
 The Committee would be concerned if inflation were running persistently above or below this objective.
" Communicating this symmetric inflation goal clearly to the public helps keep longerterm inflation expectations firmly anchored, thereby fostering price stability and moderate longterm interest rates and enhancing the Committee’s ability to  promote maximum employment in the face of significant economic disturbances."
The maximum level of employment is largely determined by nonmonetary factors that affect the structure and dynamics of the labor market.
" Consequently, it would not be appropriate to specify a fixed goal for employment; rather, the Committee’s policy decisions must be informed by assessments of the maximum level of employment, recognizing that such assessments are necessarily uncertain and subject to revision."
 Information about Committee participants’ estimates of the longerrun normal rates of output growth and unemployment is published four times per year in the FOMC’s Summary of Economic Projections.
" For example, in the most recent projections, the median of FOMC participants’ estimates of the longer -run normal rate of unemployment was 4.9 percent."
" In setting monetary policy, the Committee seeks to mitigate deviations of inflation from its longerrun goal and deviations of employment from the Committee’s assessments of its maximum level."
" However, under circumstances in which the Committee judges that the objectives are not complementary, it follows a balanced approach in promoting them, taking into account the magnitude of the deviations and the potentially different time horizons over which employment and inflation are projected to return to levels judged consistent with its mandate."
" Although Mr. Bullard supported the statement without the changes and agreed that the Committee’s inflation goal is symmetric, he dissented because he judged that the amended language was not sufficiently focused on expected future deviations of inflation from the 2 percent objective."
" In addition, because the Committee’s past behavior had demonstrated the emphasis it places on expected future inflation, Mr. Bullard viewed the amended language as potentially confusing to the public."
"Developments in Financial Markets, Open Market Operations, and Policy Normalization The SOMA manager reported on developments in domestic and foreign financial markets, including changes in the expectations of market participants for the trajectory of monetary policy."
 The report included an assessment of the response of money market interest rates to the increase in the target range for the federal funds rate announced following the December meeting.
 Previous communications had indicated that the Committee intended to allow aggregate capacity of the ON RRP facility to be temporarily elevated after policy firming had commenced to support monetary policy implementation and expected that it would be appropriate to reduce capacity fairly soon thereafter.
" Some noted that the demand for ON RRPs could be reduced by widening the spread between the interest rate on reserves and the offering rate on ON RRPs.  In making these judgments, most policymakers emphasized the primacy of maintaining monetary control in setting the appropriate capacity of the ON RRP facility for the time being; participants indicated that the Committee ’s future decisions regarding the size and ultimate longevity of the facility should be largely driven by considerations of monetary control, although other factors, such as financial stability, should also be taken into account."
Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information reviewed for the January 26 –27 meeting indicated that labor market conditions continued to improve in the fourth quarter of last year even though growth in real gross domestic product (GDP) appeared to slow.
" Consumer price inflation was still running below the Committee’s longerrun objective of 2 percent, restrained in part by decreases in both energy prices and the prices of nonenergy imports."
" Recent surveybased measures of longerrun inflation expectations were little changed, on balance, while marketbased measures of inflation compensation declined further."
"Total nonfarm payroll employment increased substantially in December, and the monthly pace of job gains in the fourth quarter as a whole was faster than in the third quarter."
" The unemployment rate remained at 5.0 percent in December, while both the labor force participation rate and the employmentto-population ratio increased a little."
 The fourweek moving average of initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits was somewhat higher in early January than its very low level late last year.
 Growth in real disposable income continued to be solid in November.
Growth in real private expenditures for business equipment and intellectual property products looked to be slower in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter.
"The U.S. international trade deficit narrowed in November, as imports fell more than exports."
 The available trade data suggested that net exports continued to weigh on real GDP growth in the fourth quarter.
" Core PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in food and energy prices, was 1¼ percent over the same 12month period, held down in part by decreases in the prices of nonenergy imports and the passthrough of declines in energy prices."
" Over the 12 months ending in December, total consumer prices as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) rose ¾ percent, while core CPI inflation was around 2 percent."
 Recent survey measures of longerrun inflation expectations were little changed on balance.
" In early January, the Michigan survey measure of median inflation expectations over the next 5 to 10 years ticked up but continued to run near the low end of its typical range of the past 15 years."
 The Survey of Primary Dealers and the Survey of Market Participants indicated that the median expectation of CPI inflation 5 to 10 years ahead was essentially unchanged in January.
"In many foreign economies, real GDP growth in the fourth quarter appeared to continue at a pace roughly similar to that in the third quarter."
" In contrast, economic growth weakened in Canada, in part because investment spending continued to be weighed down by the effects of the sharp decline in oil prices since the middle of 2014."
 Lower oil prices and the slowing in U.S. manufacturing activity contributed to a stepdown in the rate of economic growth in Mexico.
" Economic growth slowed slightly in China but remained robust, supported by a modest pickup in growth of Chinese manufacturing output."
" Further declines in energy prices pulled down inflation in many foreign economies in the fourth quarter, with inflation falling to near zero in several advanced economies."
"Staff Review of the Financial Situation Domestic financial conditions tightened over the intermeeting period, as turmoil in Chinese financial markets and lower oil prices contributed to concerns about prospects for global economic growth and a pullback from risky assets."
" Minutes of the Meeting of January 26–27, 2016Page 11_____________________________________________________________________________________________  Treasury yields declined across maturities, reflecting a downward revision in the expected path of the federal funds rate and likely some increase in safehaven demands amid the market turbulence."
The Committee’s decision to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to ¼ to ½ percent at the December meeting was widely anticipated in financial markets and elicited little reaction in Treasury and interest rate futures markets.
 Part of the decline likely also reflected an increase in safehaven demands for lowrisk and highly liquid assets amid the turbulence in financial markets.
 Measures of forward inflation compensation based on Treasury InflationPro-tected Securities and inflation swaps fell further.
" The growth of commercial and industrial (C&I) loans on banks’ books continued to be strong, although a modest net percentage of banks reported tightening standards for C&I loans to large and middlemarket firms during the fourth quarter in the most recent Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey (SLOOS)."
" The growth of CRE loans on banks’ balance sheets remained strong in the fourth quarter, and issuance of commercial mortgagebacked securities (CMBS) continued at a robust pace in Dece mber."
"Global financial market conditions deteriorated sharply in January, as recent developments in Chinese financial markets and the further decrease in crude oil prices appeared to increase concerns about global economic growth."
"Staff Economic Outlook In the economic projection prepared by the staff for the January FOMC meeting, real GDP growth in the fourth quarter of last year was estimated to have been markedly slower than in the forecast for the December meeting."
" However, the mediumterm projection for real GDP growth was only slightly lower, on balance, than the previous forecast."
 The staff estimated that the negative effects of a lower projected path for equity prices and a higher assumed trajectory for the foreign exchange value of the dollar would be mostly offset by the positive effects of a lower path for crude oil prices and slightly more stimulus to aggregate demand from changes in fiscal policy than was assumed in the previous forecast.
 The unemployment rate was expected to gradually decline further and to run somewhat below the staff’s estimate of its longerrun natural rate over this period.
"The staff’s f orecast for inflation in the near term was revised down slightly, reflecting recent data for consumer prices and the further declines in the price of crude oil; the projection for inflation over the medium term was little revised."
 The staff continued to project that inflation would increase gradually over the next several years and reach the Committee’s longer -run objective of 2 percent by the end of 2018.
"The staff viewed the uncertainty around its January projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as similar to the average of the past 20 years."
" The risks to the forecast for real GDP were seen as tilted to the downs ide, reflecting the staff’s assessment that neither monetary nor fiscal policy was well positioned to help the economy withstand substantial adverse shocks; the downside risks to the forecast of economic activity were seen as more pronounced than in December, mainly reflecting the greater uncertainty about global economic prospects and the financial market turbulence in the United States and abroad."
" Consistent with the downside risk to aggregate demand, the staff viewed the risks to its outlook for the unemployment rate as skewed to the upside."
" The risks to the projection for inflation were seen as weighted to the downside, reflecting the possibility that longerterm inflation expectations may have edged down and that the foreign exchange value of the dollar could rise substantially further, which would put downward pressure on inflation."
"Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook  In their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants saw the information received over the intermeeting period as suggesting that labor market conditions had improved further in late 2015 even as economic growth slowed."
" Inflation continued to run below the Committee’s 2  percent longerrun objective, partly reflecting declines in energy prices and in prices of nonenergy imports."
" Marketbased measures of inflation compensation declined further over the intermeeting period; surveybased measures of longerterm inflation expectations were little changed, on balance, in recent months."
"In considering the outlook for economic activity, participants weighed the divergent signals from recent strength in the labor market and the modest increase in real GDP suggested by the available data on spending and production."
" In part, the projected slow growth of real GDP in the fourth quarter of 2015 appeared to be caused by reduced inventory investment and a weatherrelated slowing in consumer spending on energy services —developments that would likely be reversed in the current quarter."
"In assessing the mediumterm outlook, participants discussed the extent to which the recent turbulence in global financial markets might restrain U.S. economic activity."
 They continued to anticipate that economic activity would expand at a moderate pace over the medium term and that the labor market would continue to strengthen.
" Inflation was expected to remain low in the near term, in part because of the further decline in energy prices."
" However, most participants continued to anticipate that inflation would rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of declines in energy and import prices dissipated and the labor market strengthened further."
" Given their increased uncertainty about how global economic and financial developments might evolve, participants emphasized the importance of closely monitoring these developments and of assessing their implications for the labor market and inflation, and for the balance of risks to the outlook."
"Growth of consumer spending appeared to have slowed in the fourth quarter, with the December data showing a decline in nominal retail sales and a stepdown in purchases of new motor vehicles from the elevated level of the preceding three months."
" Regarding the outlook for consumer spending, a number of participants noted that the recent moderation in spending seemed inconsistent with continued strong gains in households’ real income from rising employment and falling energy prices and with the relatively elevated level of consumer sentiment."
" Because of these favorable fundamentals, many participants indicated that they still expect ed consumer spending to contribute importantly to economic growth in the coming year."
" Production continued to contract in industries —such as steel and heavy machinery —in which demand had been negatively affected, either directly or indirectly, by the appreciation of the dollar, slow economic growth abroad, and declining oil prices."
" Several participants reported moderate growth in services industries, but a couple noted some slowing of activity."
" The imbalance of the supply of crude oil relative to demand remained very high and appeared unlikely to be resolved quickly, as was evidenced by a further downshift in oil futures prices."
" Participants’ contacts in the energy sector reported that firms were still adjusting to lower prices and the contraction in their businesses, and some firms expected that they would need to cut investment and employment further."
" In agriculture, depressed levels of crop prices and weak global demand continued to weaken farm income."
" Most notably, increases in nonfarm payroll employment were quite strong during the final three months of 2015."
" Although the unemployment rate, at 5.0 percent, was unchanged over that period, it was at a level close to or below most participants’ estimates of its longer -run normal rate."
" Moreover, the labor force participation rate and the employment- topopulation rate moved up toward yearend."
" In their comments on labor market conditions, participants cit ed strong employment gains, low levels of unemployment in their Districts, reports of shortages of workers in various industries, or firming in wage increases."
" Most anticipated that employment would expand at a solid rate over the year ahead, although several saw the prospect of some moderation in employment gains from the particularly large increases in the fourth quarter of 2015."
Participants discussed the implications of the further decline in the prices of oil and other commodities and the additional appreciation of the dollar since the previous FOMC meeting for the outlook for inflation.
 They agreed that these developments would keep inflation low in the near term but offered a range of views on the effects on the mediumterm outlook and the risks attending the outlook.
" Most continued to anticipate that once the price of energy and the exchange value of the dollar stabilized, the effects of those factors on inflation would fade."
 Several saw that outlook as depending importantly on continued strengthening of the labor market or on an abovetrend pace of economic activity.
" Moreover, some emphasized the need for longerrun inflation expectations to remain well anchored."
" In that regard, while some participants interpreted the recent readings on  surveybased measures of inflation expectations and marketbased measures of inflation compensation as suggesting that longterm inflation expectations were still relatively well anchored, some others expressed concern about the further decline in inflation compensation recently and the historically low levels of some survey measures of longerrun inflation expectations."
 Some noted the difficulty of distinguishing declines in expected inflation embedded in those marketbased measures from changes in risk and liquidity premiums or of interpreting the current high correlation of farfor-ward measures of inflation compensation and oil prices.
" Although most participants continued to expect that inflation would rise to the Committee’s 2  percent objective over the medium term, a number of participants indicated that, in light of recent developments, they viewed the outlook for inflation as somewhat more uncertain or saw the risks as being to the downside."
 Several participants reiterated the importance of monitoring inflation developments closely to confirm that inflation was evolving along the path anticipated by the Committee.
"Regarding the foreign economic outlook, it was noted that the slowdown in China’s industrial sector and the decline in global commodity prices could restrain economic activity in the EMEs and other commodityproducing countries for some time."
" Participants discussed recent developments in China, including the possibility that structural changes and financial imbalances in the Chinese economy might lead to a sharper deceleration in economic growth in that country than was generally anticipated."
" Moreover , global financial markets could continue to be affected by uncertainty about China’s exchange rate regime."
" The effects of these financial developments, if they were to persist, may be roughly equivalent to those from further firming in monetary policy."
" Participants mentioned several apparent factors underlying the recent financial market turbulence, including economic and financial developments in China and other foreign countries, spillovers in financial markets from stress es at firms and in countries that are producers of energy and other commodities, and an increase in concerns among market participants regarding the prospects for domestic economic growth."
  The effects of a relatively flat yield curve and low interest rates in reducing bank s’ net interest margins were also noted.
" Furthermore, developments in commodity and financial markets as well as the possibility of a significant weakening of some foreign economies had the potential to further restrain domestic economic activity, partly because the large cumulative declines in energy and other commodity prices could have pronounced adverse effects on some firms and countries that are important producers of such commodities."
" However, a few noted that the potential positive effects of lower energy costs on economic activity were a mitigating factor."
" Participants judged that the overall implication of these developments for the outlook for domestic economic activity was unclear, but they agreed that uncertainty had increased, and many saw these developments as increasing the downside risks to the outlook."
"As expected, inflation had continued to run below 2 percent, but the further decline in energy prices and the additional appreciation of the dollar likely implied that inflation would take somewhat longer than previously anticipated to rise to the Committee’s objective ."
" It was noted that although it was generally appropriate for monetary policy not to respond substantially to temporary shocks to inflation, that prescription depended in part on the assumption that longerterm inflation expectations remained well anchored."
" Participants pointed out that some marketbased measures of longerterm inflation compensation had declined to historically low levels, which increased concerns about whether inflation expectations could be moving lower."
" Other participants, however, noted that surveybased measures of longerterm inflation expectations had remained fairly steady, and a few participants characterized measures of underlying inflation rates, such as core and trimmed mean PCE inflation, as having stayed relatively stable."
 Most participants still expected inflation to increase gradually once energy prices and the prices of nonenergy imports stabilized and as the labor market strengthened further.
" However, a few participants noted that direct evidence that inflation was rising toward 2 percent would be an important element of their assessment of the outlook and of the appropriate path for policy."
  Participants expressed a range of views regarding the balance of risks to the mediumterm economic outlook and its implications for the conduct of monetary policy.
" Most participants indicated that it was difficult to judge at this point whether the outlook for inflation and economic growth had changed materially, but they thought that uncertainty surrounding the outlook had increased as a result of recent financial and economic developments."
"Several participants noted that monetary policy was less well positioned to respond effectively to shocks that reduce inflation or real activity than to upside shocks, and that waiting for additional information regarding the underlying strength of economic activity and prospects for inflation before taking the next step to reduce policy accommodation would be prudent."
" While participants continued to expect that gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy would be appropriate, they emphasized that the timing and pace of adjustments will depend on future economic and financial market developments and their implications for the mediumterm economic outlook."
" A couple of participants questioned whether some financial market participants fully appreciated that monetary policy is data dependent, and a number of participants emphasized the importance of continuing to communicate this aspect of monetary policy."
"Committee Policy Action  In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that information received since the Committee met in December suggested that labor market conditions had improved further even as economic growth slowed late last year."
" Members noted that inflation continued to run below the Committee’ s 2 percent longerrun objective, partly reflecting declines in energy prices and in prices of nonenergy imports."
" Marketbased measures of inflation compensation had declined further; surveybased measures of longerterm inflation expectations were little changed, on balance, in recent months."
" Members expected that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity would expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions would continue to strengthen."
"In assessing whether economic conditions had improved sufficiently to warrant a further increase in the target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting, members agreed that labor market data had generally been stronger than anticipated at the time of the December meeting, and some members noted that wage growth had picked up."
" Regarding the outlook for inflation, the additional sharp declines in energy prices and strengthening of the exchange value of the dollar since the December meeting were likely to hold down inflation for longer than previously anticipated, but inflation was expected to increase gradually as energy prices and the prices of nonenergy imports stabilized and the labor market strengthened further."
 A couple of members emphasized that direct evidence that inflation was rising toward 2 percent would be an important element of their assessments of the appropriate timing of further policy firming.
"In discussing the appropriate path for the target range for the federal funds rate over the medium term, members agreed that it would be important to closely monitor global economic and financial developments and to continue to assess their implications for the labor market and inflation, and for the balance of risks to the outlook."
"After assessing the outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, and after weighing the uncertainties associated with the outlook, members agreed to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged at ¼ to ½ percent."
” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at  2:00 p.m.: “Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in December suggests that labor market conditions improved further even as economic growth slowed late last year.
" Inflation has continued to run below the Committee’s 2 percent longerrun objective, partly reflecting declines in energy prices and in prices of nonen-ergy imports."
" Marketbased measures of inflation compensation declined further; surveybased measures of longerterm inflation expectations are little changed, on balance, in recent months."
"Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
" The Committee currently expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand a t a moderate pace and labor market indicators will continue to strengthen."
" Inflation is expected to remain low in the near term, in part because of the further declines in energy prices, but to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further."
" The Committee is closely monitoring global economic and financial developments and is assessing their implications for the labor market and inflation, and for the balance of risks to the outlook."
" The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting further improvement in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation."
"In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its obje ctives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation."
" This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
" In light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, the Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal."
"Consistent with the Committee’s decision to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the Board of Governors took no action to change the interest rates on reserves or discount rates."
" A staff briefing reviewed the subcommittee’s proposal, noting that these socalled fan charts could be constructed largely from information on historical errors from government and privatesector forecasts that is already provided in the SEP, thereby making it easy to explain the new charts to the public; in addition, the inclusion of a fan chart for the federal funds rate could help convey to the public that the future path of monetary policy is uncertain and will depend on economic and financial developments."
"With regard to including a fan chart to illustrate the uncertainty surrounding the path of the policy interest rate, a fan chart for the federal funds rate might be helpful in explaining that future monetary policy is necessarily uncertain and will depend upon economic and financial developments."
