"Hornstein, Seni or Advisor, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond  John Fernald, Senior Research Adviser, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco  Sean Savage, Senior Associate, Federal Reserve Bank of New York  ________________ 2 Attended the discussion of monetary policy normalization ."
"  Monetary Policy Normalization In a joint session of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, meeting pa rticipants discussed issues associated with the eventual normalization of the stance and conduct of monetary policy."
" A staff presentation outlined several approaches to raising shortterm interest rates when it becomes appropriate to do so, and to controlling the level of shortterm interest rates once they are above the effective lower bound, during a period when  the Federal Reserve will have a very large balance sheet."
" Early communication, in turn, would enhance the clarity and credibility of monetary policy and help promote the achievement of the Committee’s statutory objectives."
" Participants considered how various combinations of tools could have different implications for the degree of control over shortterm interest rates, for the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet and remittances to the Treasury, for the functioning of the federal funds market, and for financial stability in both normal times and in periods of stress."
"Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information reviewed for the April 29–30 meeting indicated that growth in economic activity paused in the first quarter as a whole, but that activity stepped up late in the quarter; this pa ttern reflected, in part, the temporary effects of the unusually cold and snowy weather earlier in the quarter and the unwinding of those effects later in the quarter."
" In March, payroll employment increased further, although the unemployment rate held steady and was still elevated."
" Consumer price inflation cont inued to run below the Committee’s longerrun objective, but measures of longerrun inflation expectations remained stable."
"The unemployment rate stayed at 6.7 percent in March, but both the labor force participation rate and the employment-topopulation ratio increased slightly."
" The rate of longduration unemployment declined somewhat, but the share of workers employed part time for economic reasons moved up; both of these measures were still well above their prerecession levels."
 Initial claims for unemployment insurance remained low over the intermeeting period.
The U.S. international trade deficit widened in February as exports fell and imports rose.
" In the advance release of the national income and product accounts, the BEA estimated that net exports subtracted substantially from real gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the first quarter."
 Both  nearand longerterm inflation expectations from the Michigan survey were unchanged in March and April.
" Over the 12 months ending in March, both the employment cost index for   privatesector workers and average hourly earnings for all employees increased only a little more than consumer price inflation."
Indicators of foreign economic activity suggested continued expansion in the first quarter but at a rate somewhat below that in the fourth quarter.
" Real GDP growth slowed markedly in China, largely reflecting lower investment growth and exports."
 Weaker exports also restrained economic activity in other emerging Asian economies.
" By contrast, economic growth remained near its so lid fourthquarter pace in the advanced foreign economies (AFEs)."
" In the euro area, the United Kingdom, and Canada, average industrial production in the first two months of the year was up moderately from the fourth quarter; in Japan, industrial production rose robustly, and consumer demand was boosted by anticipation of the April increase in the consumption tax."
 Inflation developments were mixed.
 Inflation rebounded in Cana da but remained very low in the euro area.
" In Chin a and India, inflation fell in the first quarter, largely because of lower food prices."
" Monetary policy remained highly accommodative during the intermeeting period in the AFEs and also in many EMEs, although moneta ry policy in Brazil was tightened to contain inflation pressures."
Federal Reserve communications garnered significant attention from market participants over the period but appeared to have only a modest net effect on their expectations for monetary policy.
 Measures of longerhorizon inflation compensation based on Treasury InflationProtected Securities were little changed.
" The growth in commercial and industrial loans on bank s’ balance sheets remained robust, consistent with the increase in loan demand by large and middlemarket firms reported in the April Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS)."
" According to the April SLOOS, banks again eased standards on CRE loans during the first quarter; they also reported  an increase in loan demand, especially for construction and land development loans."
" Mortgage interest rates and their spreads over Treasury yields were little changed over the intermeeting period, and applications for refinancing and purchase mortgages remained    tepid."
" The broad nominal exchange rate index for the dollar was about unchanged, as the dollar appreciated against the euro, yen, and renminbi but depreciated against most other currencies."
" However, the staff report also highlighted valuation pressures in some segments of the equity market, continued strong demand for corporate debt instruments and asso ciated pressures on underwriting standards, and liquidi ty risks associated with fixedincome mutual funds."
"Staff Economic Outlook  In the economic forecast prepared by the staff for the April FOMC meeting, real GDP growth in the first half of this year was somewhat slower than in the projection for the March meeting."
" The available readings on net exports and, to a lesser extent, residential investment pointed to less spending growth in the first quarter than the staff previously expected."
" However, the staff’s assessment was that the unan ticipated weakness in economic activity in the first quarter would be largely transitory and implied little revision to its projection for secondquarter output growth."
" In addition, the       mediumterm forecast for real GDP growth was essentially unrevised."
" The staff continued to project that real GDP would expand at a faster pace over the next few years than it did last year, an d that it would rise more quickly than the growth rate of potential output."
" The faster pace of real GDP growth was expected to be supported by an easing in the restraint from changes in fiscal policy, increases in consumer and business confidence, further improvements in credit availability and financial conditions, and a pickup in the rate of foreign economic growth."
" The expans ion in economic activity was anticipated to slowly reduce resource slack over the projection period, and the unemployment rate was expected to decline gradually to the staff’s estimate of its longerrun natural rate."
 The staff continued to forecast that inflation would remain below the Committee’s longerrun objective of 2 percent over the next few years.
" With longerrun inflation expectations assumed to remain stable, change s in commodity and import prices expected to be subdued, and slack in labor and product markets anticipated to diminish slowly, inflation was projected to rise gradually toward the Committee’s objective."
"The staff viewed the extent of uncertainty around its April projections for real GDP growth, inflation, and the unemployment rate as roughly in line with the average over the past 20 years."
" Nonetheless, the risks to the forecast for real GDP growth were viewed as tilted a little to the downside, especially because the economy was not well positioned to withstand adverse shocks while the target for the federal funds rate was at its effective lower bound."
" At the same time, the staff viewed the risks around its outlook for the unemployment rate and for inflation as roughly balanced."
" Severe winter weather had contributed to a sharp slowing in activity during the first quarter, but recent indicators pointed to a rebound and suggested that the economy had returned to a trajectory of moderate growth."
" However, some participants remarked that it was too early to confirm that the bounceback in economic activity would put the economy on a path of sustained abovetrend economic growth."
" However, a number of participants pointed to possible sources of downside risk to growth, including a persistent slowdown in the housing sector or potential international developments, such as a further slowing of growth in China or an increase in geopolitical tensions regarding Russia and Ukraine."
"Participants noted that business contacts in many parts of the country were generally optimistic about economic prospects, with reports of  increased sales of automobiles, higher production in the aerospace industry, and increased usage of industrial  power; in addition, a couple of firms with a global presence reported a notable increase in demand from customers in Europe."
 Contacts in several Districts poin ted to plans for increasing capital expenditures or to stronger demand for commercial and industrial loans.
" Views varied regarding the outlook for the multifamily sector, with the large increase in multifamily units coming to market potentially putting downward pressure on prices and rents, but the demand for this type of housing expected to rise as the population ages."
 A number of them argued that several indicators of labor underutilizat ion—including the low labor force participation rate and the stillelevated rates of longerduration unemployment and of workers employed part time for economic reasons—suggested that there is more slack in the labor market than is captured by the unemployment rate alone.
 Low nominal wage inflation was also viewed as consistent with slack in labor markets.
" Another participant observed that labor underutilization, as measured by an index that takes employment transition rates into account, was consistent with past periods in which the official unemployment rate had reached its current level, and had declined about as much relative to the official unemployment rate as it had in previous economic recoveries."
"In discussing the effect of labor market conditions on inflation, a number of participants expressed skepticism about recent studies suggest ing that longterm unemployment provides less downward pressure on wage and price inflation than shortterm unemployment does."
" A couple of participants cited other research findings that both shortand longterm unemployment rates exert pressure on wages, with the effects of longterm unemployment increasing as the level of shortterm unemployment declines."
" It was also noted that because inflation was expected to remain well below the Committee’s 2 percent objective and the unemployment  rate was still above participants’ estimates of its longerrun normal level, the Committee did not, at present, face a tradeoff between its employment and inflation objectives, and an expansion of aggregate demand would result in further progress relative to both objectives."
Inflation continued to run below the Committee’s        2 percent longerrun objective over the intermeeting period.
" Many participants saw the recent behavior of the prices of food, energy, shelter, and imports as consistent with a stabilization in  inflation and judged that the transitory factors that had reduced inflation, such as declines in administered prices for medical services, were fading."
" Most participants expected inflation to return to 2 percent within the next few years, supported by highly accommodative monetary policy, stable inflation expectations, and a continued gradual recovery in economic activity."
" However, a few others expressed the concern that the return to 2 percent inflation could be even more gradual."
" Some stated that it would be helpful to continue to explore the appropriate regulatory, supervisory, and monetary policy responses to potential risks to financial stability."
" Some thought it would be Minutes of the Meeting of April 29–30, 2014Page 7_____________________________________________________________________________________________helpful to clarify the reasoning underlying the language in the FOMC’s postmeeting statement indicating that even after employment and inflation are near mandateconsistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee view s as normal in the longer run."
"Committee Policy Action Members viewed the information received over the intermeeting period as indicating that economic growth had picked up recently, following a sharp slowdown during the winter due in part to unusually severe weather conditions."
" The unemployment rate, however, remained elevated."
" Fiscal pol icy was restraining economic growth, but the extent of that restraint had diminished."
" The Committee expected that , with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity would expand at a moderate pace and labor ma rket conditions would continue to improve gradually, moving toward those the Committee judges to be consistent with its dual mandate."
" Inflation was running below the Committee’s longerrun objective and was seen as posing possible risks to economic performance, but members anticipated that stable inflation expectations and strengthening economic activity would, over time, return inflation to the Committee’s 2 percent target."
" However, in light of their concerns about the possible persistence of low inflation, members agreed that inflation developments should be monitored carefully for evidence that inflation was moving back toward the Committee’s longerrun objective."
"In their discussion of monetary policy in the period ahead, members noted that th ere had been little change in the economic outlook since the March meeting and decided that it would be appropriate to make a further measured reduction in the pace of asset purchases at this meeting."
" However, members underscored that the pace of asset purchases was not on a preset  course and would remain contingent on the Committee’s outlook for the labor market and inflation as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of purchases."
"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct  the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: “Consistent with its st atutory mandate, the Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster maximum employment and price stability."
" The System Open Market Account Manager and the Secretary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the System’s balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the Committee’s objectives of maximum employment and price stability.” The vote encompassed appr oval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p.m.: “Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in March indicates that growth in economic activity has picked up recently, after having slowed sharply during the winter in part because of adverse weather conditions."
" The unemployment rate, however, remains elevated."
" Fiscal policy is restraining economic growth, although the extent of restraint is diminishing."
" Inflation has been running below the Committee’s longerrun objective, but longerterm inflation expectations have remained stable."
"Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
" The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions will continue to improve gradually, moving toward those the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate."
" The Committee recognizes that inflation persistently below its 2 percent objective could pose risks to economic performance, and it is monitoring inflation developments carefully for evidence that inflation will move back toward its objective over the medium term."
" In light of the cumulative progress toward maximum employment and the improvement in the outlook for labor market conditions since the inception of the current asset purchase program, the Committee decided to make a further measured reduction in the pace of its asset purchases."
" The Committee’s sizable and stillincreasing holdings of longerterm securities should maintain downward pressure on longerterm interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative, which in turn should promote a stronger economic recovery and help to ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with the Committee’s dual mandate."
" If incoming information broadly supports the Committee’s expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back toward its longerrun objective, the Committee will likely reduce the pace of asset purchases in Minutes of the Meeting of April 29–30, 2014Page 9_____________________________________________________________________________________________further measured steps at future meetings."
" However, asset purchases are not on a preset course, and the Committee’s decisions about their pace will remain contingent on the Committee’s outlook for the labor market and inflation as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases."
"To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee today reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy remains appropriate."
" In determining how long to maintain the current 0 to         ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess progress—both realized and expected—toward its objectives of maximum employment and      2 percent inflation."
" This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments."
" The Committee continues to anticipate, based on its assessment of these fact ors, that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee’s 2 percent longerrun goal, and provided that longerterm inflation expectations remain well anchored."
"When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longerrun goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent."
" The Committee currently anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near mandateconsistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run.” Voting for this action:   Janet L."
