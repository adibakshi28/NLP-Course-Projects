" ________________________ 1 In general, as specified in Article  IV, each member of the IMF undertakes to collaborate with the IMF and other members to assure orderly exchange arrangements an d to promote a stable system of exchange rates."
 These obligations include seeking to direct the member’s economic and financial policies toward the objective of fostering orderly economic growth with reasonable price stability.
 These obligations also inc lude avoiding manipulating exchange rates or the international monetary system in such a way that would impede effective balance of payments adjustment or to give an unfair competitive advantage over other members.
" Over much of the period, financial market volatility was relatively low, but volatility increased somewhat in the last couple of weeks  of the period amid shifting views among market participants about potential monetary policy actions by the Federal Reserve and foreign central banks."
" The deputy manager followed with a briefing on open market operations and developments in money markets,  including investment flows and changes in market interest rates in anticipation of the upcoming implementation of reforms to the money market fund ( MMF) industry."
" Consumer price inflation continued to run below the Committee’s longer -run objective of 2 percent, restrained in part by  earlier decreases in energy prices and in prices of non -energy imports."
" Survey -based measures of longer -run inflation expectations were little changed, on balance, while market -based measures of inflation compensation remained low."
" Total nonfarm payr oll employment expanded strongly, on average, in July and August."
 The unemployment rate remained at 4.9 percent in recent months.
 Both the labor force participation rate and the employmentto- population ratio had edged up since June.
 Labor productivity in the business sector declined slightly over the four quarters ending in the second quarter of 2016.
" Compensation per hour in the business sector rose 2 percent over the four quarters ending in the second quarter, the employment cost index for private workers increased 2½ percent over the 12 months ending in June, and average hourly earnings for all employees increased 2½  percent over the 12 months ending in August."
"The unemployment rates for African Americans and for Hispanics remained above the rate for whites, al though  Page 6Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________   the differentials in jobless rates across these groups were similar to those before the most recent recession."
 The employmentto-population ratio for individuals aged 25 to 64 continued to be higher for whites than for African Americans and for Hispanics .
" Manufacturing production was unchanged, on balance, since June and had generally been moving sideways since the end of 2014, as weak export demand and spillovers from the decline in crude oil and natural gas drilling weighed on industrial activity."
" Recent readings on key factors that influence consumer spending were consistent with solid real PCE growth for the third quarter as a whole, including continued gains in employment, real disposable personal income, and households’ net worth."
 The limited information available suggested that the change in in ventory investment would be positive in the third quarter after subtracting substantially from real GDP growth in the second quarter.
 The U.S. international trade deficit widened in June before narrowing substantially in July.
" Exports increased in both months,  with strong growth in July driven by higher agricultural exports."
" Core PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in food and energy prices, was a little above 1½ percent over those same 12  months , held down in part by decreases in the prices of non -energy imports over much of this period and the pass -through of earlier declines in energy prices into the prices of other goods and services."
" Ove r the 12 months ending in August, total consumer prices as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) rose about 1 percent, while core CPI inflation was around 2¼ percent."
 The Michigan survey measure of median longer -run inflation expectations edged down in August and was unchanged in early September.
 The measure of longer -run inflation expectations for PCE prices from the Survey of Professional Forecasters was unchanged in the third quarter.
 Other measures of longer -run inflation expectations from the Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants were also unchanged in September.
" Minutes of the Meeting of September 20–21, 2016Page 7_____________________________________________________________________________________________   Foreign real GDP growth slowed noticeably in the second quarter, primarily owing to contractions in Canada and Mexico; economic growth in other foreign economies fell only slightly on average."
 Aggregate foreign economic  growth appeared to pick up in the third quarter a mid signs of recovery of oil production in Canada and of improved manufacturing production in Mexico.
" However, weaker investment readings pointed to a slight moderation of economic activity in China in the third quarter."
 The outcome of the U.K. referendum on exit from the European Union  (Brexit ) apparently exerted less drag on economic activity than previously anticipated by many analysts .
" Nonetheless , recent data suggest ed that economic growth in Europe remained modest."
 Inflation was generally  subdued in recent months in both the advanced foreign economies (AFEs) and the emerging market economies (EMEs).
" However, domestic economic data releases appeared to be a little softer, on balance, than investors had expected; the August employment report and manufacturing surveys, in particular, were below expectations."
"Nominal  Treasury yields increased  moderately , on net, since the July FOMC meeting, reflecting the slight upward revision in the expected path for the federal funds rate and a rise in global bond yields that was apparently spurred by an increased impression among investors that monetary policy in other advanced economies might be less accommodative than previously expected."
 Measures of forward inflation compensation based on Treasury Inflation -Protected Securities rose slightly but remained near the lower end of their histori cal range.
 Growth in CRE loans at banks continued to be strong.
" Interest rates on 30 -year fixed -rate mortgages moved higher, in line with comparable -maturity Treasury yields, but remained at a low level."
" At its September meeting, the BOJ introduced a new monetary policy framework, which includes yield curve control and a commitment to expand the monetary base until inflation exceeds 2 percent and stays above that target in a stable manner."
" The pace of real GDP growth was forecast to be faster over the second half of this year than in the first half, primarily reflecting a modest increase in the rate of growth of p rivate domestic final purchases and a sizable turnaround in inventory investment."
" The staff continued to project that real GDP would expand at a modestly faster pace than potential output in 2016 through 2019, supported primarily by increases in consumer spending and, to a lesser degree, by somewhat faster growth in business investment beginning next year."
" (The staff slightly lowered its assumption for potential output growth over the medium term and in the longer run.)  The unemployment rate was forecast  to remain flat over the remainder of this year and then to gradually decline through the end of 2019; over this period, the unemployment rate was projected to run below the staff’s estimate of its longer -run natural rate."
 The forecast for consumer pr ice inflation was essentially unchanged from the previous projection.
" The staff continued to project that inflation would increase over the next several years, as food and energy prices along with the prices of nonenergy imports were expected to begin steadily rising this year."
" However, inflation was projected to be marginally below the Committee’s longer -run objective of 2 percent in 2019."
"The staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as similar to the average of the past 20 years."
" Consistent with the downside risks to aggregate demand, the staff viewed the risks to its outlook for the un employment rate as tilted to the upside."
" The risks to the projection for inflation were still judged as weighted somewhat to the downside, partly reflecting the possibility that longer -term inflation expectations may have edged down."
" Participants’ Views o n Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook  In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, members of the Board of Governors and Federal Reserve Bank presidents submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real GDP growth, the unemployment ra te, inflation, and the federal funds rate for each year from 2016 through 2019 and over the longer run.5  Each participant’s projections were conditioned on his or her judgment of appropriate monetary policy."
" The longer -run projections represented each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, unde r appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy."
" In their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, participants agreed that information received over the intermeeting period suggested that the labor market had continued to strengthen and growth of economic activity had picked up from the modest pace seen in the first half o f the year."
" Although the unemployment rate was little changed in recent months, job gains had been solid, on average."
" Inflation had continued to run below the  Committee’s 2 percent longer -run objective, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and in prices of nonenergy imports."
" Market -based measures of inflation compensation remained low; most survey -based measures of longer -term inflation expecta tions were little changed, on balance, in recent months."
" Participants generally expecte d that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity would expand at a moderate pace and labor market                                                  5 One participant did not submit longer -run projections for the change in real GDP, the unemployment rate, or the federal funds rate."
" Inflation was expected to remain low in the near term, in part because of earlier declines in energy prices, but to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of past declines in energy and import prices dissipated and the labor market strengthened further."
" However, a few still judged that  overall risks were weighted to the downside, citing various factors that includ ed the possibility of weaker -thanexpected growth in foreign economies, continued uncertainty associated with Brexit , the proximity of policy interest rates to the ef fective lower bound, or persistent headwinds to economic growth."
 Participants agreed that the Committee should continue to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments.
" Growth in consumer  spending appeared to have moderated somewhat in the third quarter from its rapid  second -quarter pace, reflecting a softening in retail sales since June."
" District contacts provided mixed reports, consistent with some easing in growth of sales."
" Nevertheless, incoming data pointe d to still -solid growth in consumption expenditures overall."
 Many participants noted that they expected household spending to be a primary contributor to economic growth going forward.
 Economic activity in the second half of the year was expected to be buoyed in part by a pickup in business fixe d investment and some rebuilding of inventories.
" Contacts in some Districts suggested that businesses were taking a cautious approach to capital spending even outside of the energy sector —for instance, preferring to modernize existing manufacturing facilities rather than increase capacity by  investing in new facilities —in light of continuing sluggish global demand, shorter investment time horizons for businesses, and uncertainty about prospects for Page 10Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________   government policy  and regulation."
" However, participants noted that economic growth  in many foreign economies remained subdued , and inflation rates abroad generally continued to be quite low."
 Reports from several Districts indicat ed widespread increases in employment over the intermeeting period.
" Al though job gains had slowed from their pace in 2015, average monthly increases so far this year h ad exceeded most estimates  discussed by participants of monthly payroll increases  that could be expected to prevail with economic growth proceeding at its longer -run trend rate."
" In addition, several participants cited the rise in the labor force participation rate since late 2015 or the increase in the employment -topopulation ratio—series with downward structural trends —as welcome developments."
" However, it was noted that the unemployment rate and broader measures of unemployment had changed little since the beginning of the year."
" P articipants generally expected the unemployment rate to run somewhat below their estimates of its longer -run normal rate over the next couple of years, but they offered differing views about the extent of slack that currently remained in the labor market."
" Some  others noted that still -muted wage growth, a level of involuntary part -time employment that remained elevated , and recent increases in labor force participation indicated that slack remained in resource utilization, or expressed the view that the longer -run normal rate of unemployment was uncertain and could be lower than current estimates."
 Participants commented on a staff analysis showing  differential patterns of unemployment across racial and ethnic  groups that remained after taking education into account; it was suggested that it might be worthwhile to examine such  issues further .
" Recent readings on headline and core PCE price inflation had come in about as expected, and participants continued  to anticipate that headline inflation would rise over the medium term to the Committee’s 2 percent objective."
" It was noted, however, that 12 -month core PCE price  inflation had been running at a steady rate below 2 percent, and several participants commented on factors that might be expected to restrain increases in inflation."
" Such factors included the limited evidence of rising cost or price pressures, the apparent low responsiveness of inflation to the rate of labor utilization, a possible downward shift in inflation expectations, and remaining economic slack."
 The median expectation for inflation over the next 5 to 10 years from the Michigan survey dropped to its historical low of 2.5 percent in August and held steady in September.
" However, a couple of  participants indicated that the drop in some survey -based measures of inflation expectations  could be explained by a decline in the number of respondents who had previously expected relatively high inflation outcomes."
 Many participants observed that core CPI inflation had been running appreciably above  core PCE inflation; it was noted that different weights on rents and medical prices a s well as  different measurement of health -care inflation in the two indexes largely account ed for the disparity.
" In their discussion  of the outlook, participants considered the likelihood of, and the potential benefits and costs associated with, a more pronounced under shooting of the longer -run normal rate of unemployment than envisioned in their modal forecasts ."
" A number of participants  noted that they expected  the unemployment rate to run somewhat below its longer -run normal rate and saw a firming of monetary policy over the next few Minutes of the Meeting of September 20–21, 2016Page 11_____________________________________________________________________________________________   years  as likely to be appropriate."
 A few participants referred to  historical episodes  when  the unemployment rate appeared  to have fallen  well below its estimated longer -run normal level.
 They observed that monetary tightening in those episodes  typically had been followed by recession and a large increase in the unemployment  rate.
" Several participants viewed  this historical experience as relevant for the Committee’s current decisionmaking and saw it as providin g evidence that waiting too long to resume  the process of policy firming could pose risks to the economic expansion, or noted that a significant increase in unemployment would have disproportionate effects on low -skilled workers and minority groups."
" Some others judged th is historical experience  to be of limited applicability in the present environment because the economy was growing only modestly above trend, inflation was below the Committee’s 2 percent objective, and inflation expectations were low —circumstances  that differed markedly from th ose earlier episodes."
" Moreover, the increase in labor force participation over the past year suggested that there could be greater scope for economic growth without putting undue pres sure on labor markets; it was also noted that the longer -run normal rate of unemployment could be lower than previously thought, with a similar implication."
 Participants agreed that it would be useful to continue to analyze and discuss the dynamics of the  adjustment of the economy and labor markets in circumstances when unemployment falls well below its estimated longer -run normal rate.
" With regard to recent financial developments, it was noted that regulatory changes and impending MMF reforms likely had led to an increase in certain short -term interest rates, but these developments were expected to have only a small effect on the borrowing costs of nonfinancial corporations and little adverse influence on overall financial market conditions."
 A  few pa rticipants expressed concern that the protracted period of very low interest rates might be encouraging excessive borrowing and increased leverage in the nonfinancial corporate sector.
" Finally, one participant expressed the view that prolonged periods of low interest rates could encourage pension funds, endowments, and investors with fixed future payout obligations to save more, depressing economic growth and adding to downward pressure on the neutral real interest rate."
" Participants discussed reasons  for the apparent fall over recent years in the neutral real rate of interest —or r* —including lower productivity growth, demographic shifts, and an excess of saving around the world."
" Al -though several participants indicated that there was uncertainty as t o how long  the low level of  r* would persist , one pointed to a growing consensus that the long period of slow productivity growth and recent evidence that the neutral rate had fallen across countries suggested that r* was likely to remain low for some time."
" Participants discussed the implications of a fall in longer -run r* for monetary p olicy, including the possibility that policy interest rates might be  closer to the effective lower bound more frequently and for a long period , or that monetary policy was ill  equipped to address structural factors such as the decline in productivity growt h."
 A couple of participants noted that a lower estimated value for r* over the near term implied that monetary policy was providing less accommodation than previously thought.
" With inflation continuing to run below the Committee’s 2 percent objective and few signs of increased pressure on wages and prices, most of th ese participants thought it would be appropriate to await further evidence of continued progress toward the Committee’s statutory objectives."
" In contrast, some other participants believed that the economy was at or near full employment and inflation was moving toward 2 percent."
" They maintain ed that a further delay in raising the target range would unduly  increase the risk of the unemployment rate fall ing markedly below its longer -run normal level, necessitating a more rapid removal of monetary policy accommodation that could shorten the economic expansion."
" Some participants  believed that it would Page 12Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________   be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate relatively soon if the labor market continued to improve and economic activity strengthened, while some others preferred to wait for more convincing evidence t hat inflation was moving toward  the Committee’s 2 percent objective."
" Committee Policy Action  In their discussio n of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that the information received since the Committee met in July indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and growth of economic activity had picked up from the modest pace seen in the first half of this year."
" Al though the unemployment rate was little changed in recent months, job gains had been solid, on average."
" Inflation had continued to run below the Committee’s 2 percent longer -run objective, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and in prices of nonenergy imports."
" Market -based measures of inflation compensation remained low; most survey -based measures of longer -term i nflation expectations were little changed, on balance, in recent months."
" With respect to the economic outlook and its implications for monetary policy, members continued to expect that, with g radual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity would expand at a moderate pace and labor market indicators would strengthen  somewhat further ."
"  Members generally acknowledged that labor market conditions had improved appreciably over the past year, evidenced in particular by the solid pace of monthly payroll employment gains."
" Some of them noted  that the increase in the labor force participation rate this year suggested more room for labor supply to expand  than previously expected, or contended that the slower progress seen this year in other labor market indicators —such as the unemployment rate, broader measures of labor utilization, job openings and quits, and wage growth—indicated that slack was being taken up at only a modest pace."
 This view suggested that proceeding cautiously with reducing monetary policy accom modation could promote further labor market improvement.
" In contrast, a few other members were concerned that, without a prompt resumption of gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate, labor market conditions could tighten well beyo nd normal levels over the next few years,  potentially necessitating a subsequent sharp tightening of monetary policy that could shorten the economic expansion."
" Members continued to expect inflation to remain low in the near term, but most anticipated that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, it would rise gradually to the Committee’s 2 percent objective over the medium term."
 Many members remarked that there were few signs of emerging inflationary pressures or that progress on inflation had been slow.
 A couple of other members pointed to recent readings on core CPI inflation as suggesting that PCE price inflation was close to meeting the Committee’s  2 percent inflation objective.
" Nonetheless, in light of the current shortfall of  inflation from 2 percent, members agreed that they would continue to carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward the Committee’s inflation goal."
" After assessing the outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, as well as the risks around that outlook, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at ¼ to ½ percent at this meeting."
" But, with some slack likely remaining in the labor market and inflation continuing to run below the Committee’s objective, a majority of members  judged  that the Committee should, for the time being, await further evidence of progress toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation before increasing the target range for the federal funds rate."
 It was noted that a reasonable argument could be made either for  an increase at this meeting or for  waiting for some additional information on the labor market and inflation.
 They cautioned that postponing policy firming for too long could push the unemployment rate markedly below its longer -run norma l rate over the next few years.
"  Minutes of the Meeting of September 20–21, 2016Page 13_____________________________________________________________________________________________   The Committee agreed that, in determining the timing and size of  future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, it would assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation."
" This assessment would take into account a wide range of  information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
" A few others, however, emphasized that decisions regarding near -term adjustments in the stance of monetary policy would appropriately remain data dependent and exp ressed some concern that the new sentence might be misread as indicating that the passage of time rather than the accumulation of evidence would be the key factor in the Committee’s decisions at future meetings."
” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00  p.m.: “Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in July indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and growth of economic activity has picked up from the modest pace seen in the first half of this year.
" Although the unemployment rate is little changed in recent months, job gains have been solid, on average."
" Inflation has continued to run below the Committee ’s 2 percent longer -run objective, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and in prices of non - energ y imports ."
" Market -based measures of inflation compensation remain low; most survey -based measures of longer -term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance, in recent months ."
"  Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
" The Committee expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a Page 14Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________   moderate pace and labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat further ."
" Inflation  is expected to remain low in the near term, in part because of earlier declines in energy prices, but to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of past declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthe ns further ."
 The Committee continues to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments.
" The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting further improvement in labor market conditions and a return to 2  percent inflation."
" In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds  rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2  percent inflation."
" This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market con ditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
" In light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2  percent, the Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected progre ss toward its inflation goal."
" Ms. George judged that with the unemployment rate and inflation at or near their longer -run levels, removing some accommodation was warranted and would be consistent with the prescriptions of several frameworks for assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy."
" He believed that with inflation gradually rising and robust employment growth moving the economy very close to full employment, it was appropriate to continue the gradual normalization of monetary policy at this meeting."
" He believed that a failure to do so could require the Minutes of the Meeting of September 20–21, 2016Page 15_____________________________________________________________________________________________   Committee to raise policy interest rates faster and more aggressively later on, which could shorten, rather than lengthen, the duration of the economic expansion."
" Consistent with the Committee ’s decision to leave the target range for the federal funds rate u nchanged, the Board of Governors took no action to change the interest rates on reserves or discount rates."
"Madigan  Secretary  Page 16Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________    Summary of Economic Projections  In conjunction with the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting held on September 20–21, 2016, meeting participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real output growth, the unemployment rate, inflation, and the federal funds rate for each year from 2016 to 2019 and over the longer run.1  Each participant’s projection was based on information available at the time of the meeting, together with his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy and assumptions about the factors likely to affect economic outcomes."
" The longerrun projections represent each participant’s assessment of the value to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy."
 “Appropriate monetary policy” is defined as the futu re path of policy that each participant deems most likely to foster outcomes for economic activity and inflation that best satisfy his or her individual interpretation of the Federal Reserve’s objectives of maximum employment and stable prices.
"Most FOMC participants expected that, under appropriate monetary policy, growth in real gross domestic product (GDP) would pick up a bit next year and run at or a little above their individual estimates of its longerrun rate in 2017 and 2018, and a majo rity of participants expected real GDP growth to be at its longerrun trend rate in 2019."
 A large majority of  participants projected that the unemployment rate will fall to or modestly below their estimates of its longerrun normal level over the next two years.
 Many participants expected the unemployment rate to edge up to or toward their individual estimates of its longerrun le vel in 2019.
" All participants projected that inflation, as measured by the fourquarter percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), would increase over the next two years, and all but one expected inflation to be within 0.1 percentage point of the Committee’s objective in 2019."
" Participants generally judged that the appropriate level of the federal funds rate in 2019 would still be at or below their                                                  1 One participant did not submit longerrun projections for the change in real GDP, the unemployment rate, or the federal funds rate."
"Participants generally viewed the level of uncertainty associated with their individual forecasts for economic growth, unemployment, and inflation as broadly similar to the norms of the previous 20 years."
" Most participants also judged the risks around their projections for economic activity and for the unemployment rate as broadly balanced, while several particip ants saw the risks to their GDP growth forecasts as weig hted to the downside."
" In addition, most participants saw the risks to their forecasts for inflation as broadly balanced, although some viewed the risks to their inflation forecasts as tilted to the downside."
"The Outlook for Economic Activity The median of participants’ projections for the growth rate of real GDP, conditional on their individual assumptions about appropriate monetary policy, was 1.8 percent in 2016, 2 percent in 2017 and 2018, and 1.8 percent in 2019; the medi an of projections for the longerrun normal GDP growth rate was 1.8 percent."
" Most participants projected that economic growth will pick up a bit next year and run at or slightly above their individual estimates of its longerrun rate in 2017 and 2018, and a majority of partic ipants expected real GDP growth to be at its longerrun  trend rate in 2019."
" Participants pointed to a number of factors that they expected would contribute to abovetrend output growth over the next few years, including some firming in business investment, diminution of the drag on net exports from a strong dollar, continued improvements in household and business balance sheets, and accommodative financial conditions."
The median of participants’ projections for real GDP growth in 2016 was lower than the median shown in the June 2016 Summary of Economic Projections (SEP).
 Many participants who lowered their projections for GDP growth this year attributed their revisions to weakerthan-expected GDP growth in the first half of the year.
 The medians of participants’ projections for real GDP growth in 2017 and 2018 were unchanged Page 1_____________________________________________________________________________________________Table 1.

Projections for the unemployment rate are for the average civilian unemployment rate in the fourthquarter of the year indicated.
Each participant’s projections are based on his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy.
Longerrun projections represent each participant’sassessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy.
"For the September 20–21, 2016, meeting, one participantdid not submit longerrun projections for the change in real GDP, the unemployment rate, or the federal funds rate.1. For each period, the median is the middle projection when the projections are arranged from lowest to highest."

" This pace was slightly above the median projection of the longerrun growth rate of GDP, which was revised down to 1.8 percent."
"The median of projections for the unemployment rate at the end of 2016 was 4.8 percent,  slightly higher than in June."
" Based on the median projections, the unemployment rate was anticipated to decline to 4.6 percent in 2017 and to 4.5 percent in 2018 before moving up slightly to 4.6 percent in 2019."
" The median for 2019 remained below the 4.8 percent median assessment of the longerrun normal unemployment rate, with a majority of participants projecting the unemployment rate in 2019 to be 0.2 percentage point or more below their individual estimates of the longerrun normal rate."
Figures 3.A and 3.B show the distributions of participants’ projections for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate from 2016 to 2019 and in the longer run.
" The distribution of individual projections of GDP growth for 2016 shifted lower relative to the distribution of the June projections, while the distributions for 2017 and 2018 were little changed."
 The distribution of projections for GDP growth in the longer run shifted down slightly.
 The distributions of projections for the unemployment rate were little changed except for a shift upward for 2016.
"The Outlook for Inflation In the September SEP, the median of projections for headline PCE price inflation  in 2016 was 1.3 percent, a bit lower than in June."
" The projections for headline PCE price inflation over the next two years and in the longer run were little changed since June, with the median inflation projection still  rising to 1.9 percent in 2017 and to the Committee’s objective of 2 percent in 2018, then remaining there in 2019."
 All participants but one projected that inflation will be within 0.1 percentage point of the Committee’s objective in 2019.
 The median of individual projections for core PCE price inflation increases gradually over the next two years.
Figures 3.C and 3.D provide information on the distribution of participants’ views about the outlook for inflation.
" The distribution of projections for headline PCE price inflation for this year shifted down relative to pro2 One participant’s projections for the federal funds rate, GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation were informed by the view that there are multiple possible mediumterm regimes for the U.S. economy, that these regimes are persistent, and that the economy  shifts between  regimes  in a way that  jections for the June meeting, with some participants attributing their forecast re visions to weakerthan- expected incoming data, while the distribution of projections for core PCE price inflation this year narrowed."
" For 2017 and 2018, the distributions of proj ections for both total and core PCE price inflation shifted down slightly."
Appropriate monetary policy Figure 3.E provides the distribution of participants’ judgments regarding the appropriate level of the target federal funds rate at the end of each year from 2016 to 2019 and over the longer run.2  The distributions for 2016 to 2018 shifted down.
"In discussing their Septembe r forecasts, many participants expressed a view that increases in the federal funds rate over the next several years would need to be gradual in light of a shortterm neutral interest rate that was currently low and likely to rise only slowly."
" A number of participants attributed the low level of the shortterm neutral rate to the persistence of low productivity growth, continued strength of the dollar, a weak outlook for economic growth abroad, demand for safe longerterm assets, and other factors, and they anticipated that the effects of these factors would fade gradually over time."
 Some participants noted the proximity of shortterm nominal interest rates to the effective lower bound as limiting the Committee’s ability to increase monetary accommodation to counter adverse shocks to the economy.
" Under this view, the economy currently is in a regime characterized by expansion of economic activity with low productivity growth and a low shortterm real interest rate, but longerterm outcomes for variables other than inflation cannot be usefully projected."

"Uncertainty and risks The lefthand column of figure 4 shows that, for each variable, all but a few participants judged the levels of uncertainty associated with their September projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and headline inflation to be broadly similar to the average of the past 20 years, and all but one participant viewed uncertainty around core inflation to be broadly similar to its average historical level.3  One participant saw uncertainty surrounding real GDP growth as higher than average, down from three participants in June."
 Participants noted that continued uncertainty about the rate of productivity growth and concerns about international developments were sources of uncertainty attending their forecasts of real GDP growth.
"For each variable, the number of participants viewing the risks as balanced increased since June, and fewer participants assessed the risks to economic growth as weighted to the downside or viewed the risks to unemployment as weighted to the upside (figure 4, top two panels in the righthand column)."
 Participants who revised their view from an assessment that the risks to GDP growth were to the downside to a view that the risks were broadly balanced cited reasons such as an easing of concerns regarding the potential for global economic and financial conditions to deteriorate.
" Participants who saw the risks to GDP growth as tilted to the downside attributed this assessment to some signs that the momentum of growth in domestic demand may be slowing, businesses’ caution regarding investment and hiring decisions, the risk of adverse shocks to U.S. economic activity from developments abroad, or potential limits to the ability of monetary policy to respond to adverse shocks near the effective lower bound on shortterm interest rates."
" As indicated in the two bottomright figures, the number of participants who saw the risks to their inflation projections as broadly balanced increased; those who revised their view  from an assessment that the risks to inflation were tilted downward pointed to an easing of concerns about global financial developments                                                  3 Table 2 provides estimates of the forecast uncertainty for the change in real GDP, the unemployment rate, and total consumer price inflation over the period from 1996 through 2015."

 or accumulating evidence th at inflation expectations were remaining anchored at policyconsistent levels.
 Those who continued to judge that the risks to inflation were weighted to the downside  cited the risks associated with encountering negative economic shocks when the policy rate is close to the effective lower bound or with continued low readings on surveybased measures of inflation expectations and financialmarket measures of inflation compensation.

" Thus, in setting the stance of monetary policy, participants consider not only what appears to be the most likely economic outcome as embodied in their projections, but also the range of alternative possibilities, the likelihood of their occurring, and the potential costs to the economy should they occur."
"Table 2 summarizes the average historical accuracy of a range of forecasts, including those reported in past Monetary Policy Report s and those prepared by the Federal Reserve Board’s staff in advance of meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee."
" The corresponding 70 percent confidence intervals for overall inflation would be 1.2 to 2.8 percent in the current year and 0.9 to 3.1 percent in the second, third, and fourth years."
"As with real activity and inflation, the outlook for the future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable uncertainty."
 This uncertainty arises primarily because each participant’s assessment of the appropriate stance of monetary policy depends importantly on the evolution of real activity and inflation over time.
