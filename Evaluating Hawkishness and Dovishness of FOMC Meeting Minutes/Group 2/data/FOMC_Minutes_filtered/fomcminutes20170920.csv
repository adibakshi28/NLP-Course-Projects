" The deputy manager provided updat es on developments with respect to reference interest rates  and on small -value tests of open market operations, which are conducted routinely to promote operational readiness ."
" Only limited data pertaining to the economic effects of the se hurricanes were available at the time of the meeting, but it appeared likely that the negative effects would restrain national economic activity only in the near term.5  Total consumer price inflation, as measured by the 12 -month change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), continued to run below 2  percent in July and was lower than at the start of the year."
 Survey -based measures of longer -run inflation expectations were little changed on balance.
" Total nonfarm payroll employment rose solidly in July and August, with strong gains in privatesector jobs and declines in government employment."
 The unemployment rate dipped to 4.3  percent in July and edged back up to 4.4 percent in August.
" The unemployment rates for African Americans, for Hispanics, and for whites were lower, on average, in  recent months than around the start of the year, whereas the unemployment rate for Asians was a little higher."
" Initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits jumped in early September from a very low level, and  the Department of Labor noted that Hurricane Harvey  had an effect on claims ."
" Compensation per hour rose just 1¼ percent over the four quarters ending in the second quarter of 2017 (partly reflecting a significant downward revision to compensation per hour in the second half of  2016) , the employment cost index for private workers increased 2½  percent over the 12 months ending in June, and average hourly earnings for all employees ros e 2½ percent over the 12  months ending in August."
" However, recent readings on key factors that influence consumer spending —including continued gains in employment, real disposable personal income, and households’ net worth —remained supportive of solid growth in  real PCE."
The nominal U.S. internati onal trade deficit narrowed substantially in June and was about unchanged in July.
 The available data suggested that net exports contributed positively to real GDP growth in the third quarter.
" C ore PCE price inflation, which excludes consumer food and energy prices, also was about 1½  percent over that same period."
" Over the 12 months ending in August, the consumer price index (CPI) increased almost 2  percent, while core CPI inflation was 1¾  perce nt."
" The median of inflation expectations over the next 5 to 10 years from the Michigan survey edged back up in the preliminary reading for September, and the median expectation for PCE price inflation over the next 10 years from the Survey of Professional Forecasters edged down."
 The medians of longer -run inflation expectations from the Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants were relatively little changed in September.
 Foreign economic activity continued to expand at a solid pace.
" Economic growth picked up in the advanced foreign economies (AFEs) in the second quarter, especially in Canada, and incoming indicators suggested that growth slowed in the third quarter but remained firm."
" Recent indicators from the emerging market economies (EMEs) also pointed to continued strong economic growth, notwithstan ding some slowing in the rate of expansion of activity in China."
" Headline inflation in most AFEs remained subdued, held down in part by falling retail energy prices, but data through August suggested that the drag from energy prices was diminishing."
" Infl ation also remained low in most EMEs, al though food prices continued to put upward pressure on inflation in Mexico."
" At the same time , financing conditions for households and nonfinancial businesses continued  to provide support for growth in spending and investment."
 Market participants were attentive to the Committee’s assessment of recent below -expectations inflation data and the acknowledgment in the July FOMC minutes that inflation might continue to run below the Committee’s 2  percent objective for longer than anticipated .
" Measures of inflation compensation over the next 5 years rose  modestly , on net, partly in response to the release of higher -thanexpected CPI data for August, while inflation compensation 5 to 10 years ahead was little changed."
" Meanwhile, the growth of commercial and industrial (C&I) loans on banks’ books ticked up Minutes of the Meeting of September 19–20, 2017Page 5_____________________________________________________________________________________________   in July and August compared with its pace over the first half of the year; however, C&I loan growth from the fourth quarter of last year through August re mained significantly lower than over recent years."
" The growth of commercial real estate (CRE) loans on banks’ books continued to moderate in July and August, reflecting a slowdown in lending both for nonfarm nonresidential units and for construction and land development; nonetheless, CRE financing appeared to remain broadly available."
" Interest rates on 30 -year fixed -rate residential mortgages moved lower over the intermeeting period, in line with comparable -maturity Treasury yields."
 The shortterm disruptions to spending and production associated with Hurricanes Harvey and Irma were expected to reduce real GDP growth in the third quarter and to boost it in the fourth quarter as production returned to its pre -hurricane path and as a portion of the lost spending was made up.
" The hurricanes were also expected to depress payroll employment in September, with a reversal over the next few months."
" Beyond 2017, the forecast for real GDP growth was little revised."
" Because of continued subdued inflation readings and, given real GDP growth,  a larger -thanexpected decline in the unemployment rate over much of the past year , the staff revise d down slightly its estimate of the long errun natural rate of unemployment in this projection."
" The staff’s forecast for consumer price inflation, as measured by the change in the PCE price index, was revised up somewhat for 2017 in response to hurricane -related effects on gasoline prices."
 The near -term forecast for core PCE price inflation was essentially unrevised.
" Total PCE price inflation this year was e xpected to run at the same pace as last year, with a slower increase in core PCE prices offset by a slightly larger increase in energy prices and an upturn in the prices for food and nonenergy imports."
" Beyond 2017, the inflation forecast was little revis ed from the previous projection."
 The staff continued to project that inflation would edge higher in the next couple of years and that it would reach the Committee’s longer -run objective in 2019.
"The staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as similar to the average of the past 20  years."
 The staff saw the risks to the forecasts for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate as balanced.
 The risks t o the projection for inflation were also seen as balanced.
 Downside risks included the possibilities that longer -term inflation expectations may have Page 6Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________   edged down or that the recent run of soft inflation readings could prove to be more persistent than the s taff expected.
 These downside risks were seen as essentially counterbalanced by the upside risk that inflation could increase more than expected in an economy that was projected to continue operating above its longer -run potential.
"Participants ’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook  In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, members of the Board of Governors and Federal Reserve Bank presidents submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real output growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2017 through 2020 and over the longer run, based on their individual assessments of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate.6  The longer -run projections represented each participant’s assessment of the rate to whic h each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy."
" In their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants agreed that information received over the intermeeting period indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity  had been rising moderately so far this year."
" Job gains had remained solid in recent months, and the unemployment rate had stayed low."
" Household spending had been expanding at a moderate rate, and growth in business fixed investment had picked up in recent quarters."
" On a 12 -month basis, overall inflation and the measure excluding food and energy prices had declined this year and were running below 2 percent."
 Market -based measures of inflation compensation remained low; survey -based measures of longer -term inflation expectations were little changed on balance.
" Participants acknowledged that Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria would affect economic activity in the near term."
 They expected growth of real GDP in the third quarter to be held down by the sever e disruptions caused by the storms but to rebound beginning in the fourth quarter as rebuilding got under way and economic activity in the affected areas resumed.
" Similarly, employment would be temporarily depressed by the hurricanes,                                                  6 Four members of the Board of Governors, the same number as in June 2017, were in office at the time of the September 2017 meeting."
" The office of the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond was vacant at the time of both but, abstracting fro m those effects, employment gains were anticipated to remain solid, and the unemployment rate was expected to decline a bit further by year -end."
" Moreover , they generally viewed the information on spending, production, and labor market activity that became available over the inter meeting period, which was mostly not affected by the hurricanes, as suggesting little change in the outlook for economic growth and the labor market over the medium term."
" Consequently, they continued to expect that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity would expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions would strengthen somewhat further."
" In the aftermath of the hurricanes, higher prices for gasoline and some other items were likely to boost inflation temporarily."
" Apart from that effect, inflation on a 12 -month basis was expected to remain somewhat below 2  percent in the near term but to stabilize around the Committee’s 2 percent objective over the medium term."
" Near -term risks to the economic outlook appeared roughly balanced, but participants agreed to continue to monitor inflation developments closely."
" Participants expected some fluctuations in consumer spending to result from  the hurricanes, but they generally judged that consumption growth would continue to be supported by stillsolid fundamental determinants of household spending, including the income generated by the ongoing strength in the labor market, improved household balance sheets, and high levels of consumer confidence."
" Sales of autos and light trucks had softened over the summer, leading producers to slow production to address a buildup of inventories, but a couple of participants noted that automakers expected to see a temporary increase in demand as households and businesses replaced vehicles damaged during the storms."
" One participant did not submit longer -run projections for real output growth, the unemployment r ate, or the federal funds rate."
" Overall, the available information suggested  that, although the storms would likely affect the quarterly pattern of changes in real GDP at least through the second half of the year , economic activity would continue to expand at a moderate rate over the medium term, supported by further gains in consumer spending and the pickup in business investment."
" In addition, improving global economic conditions and the depreciation of the dollar in recent months were anticipated to result in a modest positive contribution to domestic economic activity from net  exports."
 The  increases in nonfarm payroll employment in July and August remained well above the pace likely to be sustainable in the longer run.
" Al though the unemployment rate was little changed from March to August, it remained below participants’ estimates of its longer -run normal level."
" In addition, the number of individuals working part time for economic reasons, as a share of household employment, had move d lower."
" However, some  participants still saw room for further increases in labor utilization, with a couple of them noting that  the employment -topopulation ratio and the participation rate for prime -age workers had not fully recovered  to pre -recession levels ."
" Increases in m ost aggregate measures of hourly wages and labor compensation  remained subdued , and several participants commented that the absence of broad -based upward wage pressures suggested that the sustainable rate of unemployment might be lower than t hey currently estimated."
" Other factors that may have been contributing to the subdued pace of wage increases reported in the national data included  low productivity growth, changes in the composition of the workforce, and competitive pressure on employers  to hold down their costs."
" However, reports from business contacts in several Districts indicated that employers in labor markets in which demand was high or in which workers in some occupations were in short supply were raising wages noticeably to compet e for workers and limit turnover."
 It was noted that the expected increase in demand for skilled construction workers for reconstruction in hurricane -affected areas would likely exacerbate existing shortages.
" In their review of the recent data and the outlook for inflation, participants discussed a number of factors that could be contributing to the low readings on consumer prices this year and weighed the extent to which those factors might be transitory or could prove more persistent."
 Many participants continued to believe that the cyclical pressures associated with a tightening labor market or an economy operating above its potential were likely to show through to higher inflation over the medium term.
" In addition, many judged that at least part of the softening in inflation this year was the result of idiosyncratic  or one -time factors , and, thus,  their effects were likely to fade over time."
" Some participants discussed the possibility that s ecular trends , such as  the influence of technological innovations on competition and business pricing, also  might have been  muting  inflationary pressures  and could be intensifying ."
" It was noted that other advanced economies were also experiencing low inflation, which might suggest that common global factors could be contributing  to persistence of below -target inflation  in the United States and abroad ."
 Several participants comment ed on the importance of longer -run inflation expectations to the outlook for a return of inflation to 2  percent.
" A number of indicators of inflation expectations, including survey  statistics  and estimates derived from financial market data, were generally  viewed as indicating that longer -run inflation expectations remained reasonably stable, although a few participants saw some of these measures as low or slipping."
 Participants raised a number of important considerations about the implications of persiste ntly low inflation for the path of the federal funds rate over the medium run.
" Several expressed concern that the persistence of low rates of inflation might imply that the underlying trend was running below 2 percent, risking a decline in inflation expectations."
" If so, the appropriate policy path should take into account the need to bolster inflation expectations in order to ensure that inflation returned to 2 percent and to prevent erosion in the credibility of the Committee’s objective ."
 It was also noted that the persistence of low inflation might result  in the federal funds rate staying uncomfortably close to its effective lower bound .
" However, a few others pointed out the need to consider  the lags in the response of inflation to tightening resource utilization  and, thus, increasing  upside risks to inflation as the labor market tightened further."
" On balance, participants continued to forecast that PCE price inflation would stabilize around  the Committee’s 2 percent objective over the medium term."
" However, several noted that in preparing their projections for this meeting, they h ad taken on board the likelihood that convergence to the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent inflation objective might take somewhat longer than they anticipated earlier."
 Participants generally agreed it would be important to monitor inflation developments closely.
 Several of them noted that interpreting the next few inflation reports would likely be complicated by the temporary runup in energy costs and in the prices of other items affected by storm -related disruptions and rebuilding.
" In financial markets, longer -term interest rates and the foreign exchange value of the dollar declined over the intermeeting period, and equity prices increased ."
" In contrast, a few participants cautioned that these financial market conditions might not deliver much impetus to aggregate demand  if they instead reflected a more pessimistic assessment of prospects for longer -run eco nomic growth and , accordingly , a view that the longer -run neutral rate of interest in the United States would remain low."
"In their discussion of monetary policy, all participants agreed that the economy had evolved broadly as they had anticipated at the ti me of the June meeting and that the incoming data had not materially altered the medium -term economic outlook."
" Minutes of the Meeting of September 19–20, 2017Page 9_____________________________________________________________________________________________   With the me dium -term outlook little changed, inflation below 2 percent, and the neutral rate of interest estimated to be quite low, all participants thought it would be appropriate for the Committee to maintain the current target  range for the  federal funds rate at t his meeting, and nearly all supported again indicat ing in the postmeeting statement that a gradual approach to increasing the federal funds rate will likely be warranted."
" Nevertheless , many participants expressed concern that the low inflation readings this year might reflect not only transitory factors , but also the influence of developments that could prove more persistent, and it was  noted that some  patience in removing policy accommodation while assessing trends in inflation was warranted ."
" Some other participants, however, were more worri ed about upside risks to inflation arising from a labor market that had already reached full employment and was projected to tighten further."
 These participants cautioned that an unduly  slow pace in removing policy accommodation could result in an overshoot of the Committee’s inflation objective in the medium term that would likely be costly to reverse or could lead to an intensification of financial stability risks or to other imbalances that might prove difficult to unwind.
" Several others noted that, in light of th e uncertainty around their outlook for inflation, their decision on whether to take such a policy action would depend importantly on whether the economic data in coming months increased their confidence that inflation was moving up toward the Committee’s o bjective."
 A few  participants thought that additional increases in the federal funds rate should be deferred until incoming information confirmed that the low readings on inflation this year were not likely to persist and that inflation was clearly on a pa th toward the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective over the medium term.
" Committee Policy Action  In their discussion o f monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that information received since the Committee met in July indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising moderately so far this year."
" Job gains had remained solid in recent months, and the unemployment rate had stayed low."
" Household spending had been expanding at a moderate rate, and growth in business fixed investment had picked up in recent quarters."
" On a 12 -month basis, overall inflation and the measure excluding food and energy prices had declined this year and were running below 2  percent."
 Market -based measures of inflation compensation remained low; survey -based measures of longer -term inflation expectations were little changed on balance.
" Members judged that stormrelated disruptions and rebuilding would affect economic activity in the near term, but past experience suggested  that the hurricanes were unlikely to materially alter the course of the national economy over the medium term."
" Consequently, the Committee continued to expect that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity would expand  at a moderate pace, and labor market conditions would strengthen somewhat further."
" Higher prices for gasoline and some other items in the aftermath of the hurricanes would likely boost inflation temporarily; apart from that effect, inflation on a 12mont h basis was expected to remain somewhat below 2 percent in the near term but to stabilize around the Committee’s 2 percent objective over the medium term."
" Members saw near -term risks to the economic outlook as roughly balanced, but they agreed to continue  to monitor inflation developments closely."
" After assessing current conditions and the outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, members decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1 to 1¼ percent."
" They noted t hat the stance of monetary policy remained accommodative, thereby supporting some further strengthening in labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2  percent inflation."
 Members agreed that the timing and size of future adjustments to the target ra nge for the federal funds rate would depend on their assessment of realized and expected economic conditions relative to the Committee’s objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.
" In particular, they reaffirmed that they would carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to the Committee’s symmetric inflation goal."
" Some memb ers emphasized that, in considering the timing of further adjustments in the federal funds rate, they would be evaluating incoming information to assess the likelihood that recent low readings on inflation were transitory and that inflation was again on a trajectory consistent with achieving the Committee’s 2 percent objective over the medium term."
” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00  p.m.: “Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in July indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising moderately so far this year.
" Job gains have remained solid in recent months, and the unemployment rate has stayed low."
" Household spending has been expanding at a moderate rate, and growth in business fixed inv estment has picked up in recent quarters."
" On a 12 -month basis, overall inflation and the measure excluding food and energy prices have declined this year and are running below 2  percent ."
" Market -based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey -based measures of longer -term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance."
" Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
" Storm -related disruptions and rebuilding will affect economic activity in the near term, but past experience suggests that the storms are unlikely to materially Minutes of the Meeting of September 19–20, 2017Page 11_____________________________________________________________________________________________   alter the course of the national economy over the medium term."
" Consequently, the Committee continues to expect that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, and labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat further."

" Near -term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced, but the Committee is monitoring inflation developments closely."
" In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Commi ttee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1 to 1 ¼ percent ."
" The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting some further strengthening in labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2  percent  inflation."
" In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2  percent inflation."
" This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
 The Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to its symmetric inflation goal.
"Consistent with the Committee’s decision to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the Board of Governors voted unanimously to leave the interest rates on required and excess reserve balances unchanged at 1¼  percent and voted unanimously to approve establishment of the primary credit rate (discount rate) at the existing level of 1¾  percent .7 It was agreed that the n ext meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday –Wednesday, October  31–November  1, 2017."
Madigan  Secretary                                                   7 The second vote of the Board also encompassed approval of the establishment of the interest rates for secondary and seasonal credit under the existing formulas for computing such rates.
" Page 12Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________    Summary of Economic ProjectionsIn conjunction with the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting held on September 19 –20, 2017, meeting participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real output growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2017 to 2020 and over the longer run.1  Each participant’s projection s were  based on information available at the time of the meeting, together with his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy —including a path for the federal funds rate and its longer -run value —and assumptions about other factors likely to affect economic outcomes."
" The longer -run projections represent each participant’s assessment of the value to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy.2  “Appropriate monetary policy” is defined as the future path of policy that each participant deems most likely to foster outcomes for economic activity and inflation that best satisfy his o r her individual interpretation of the Federal Reserve’s objectives of maximum employment and stable prices."
" All participants who submitted longer -run projections expected that, under appropriate monetary policy, growth in real gross domestic product (GDP) this year would run somewhat above their individual estimates of its longer -run rate."
" Almost all participants projected that economic growth would moderate over the next three years, and almost all projected that real GDP  growth in 2019 and 2020 would be  at or close to their individual estimate s of the economy’s longer -run potential growth rate."
" All participants who submitted longer -run projections expected that the unemployment rate would run below their estimates of its longer -run normal level in 2017, and almost all project ed that the unemployment rate would remain below their estimates of its longer -run level through 2020."
" All participants projected that inflation, as measured by the four -quarter percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expend itures (PCE), would run below 2  percent in 2017 and                                                  1 Four members of the Board of Governors, the same number as in June 2017, were in office at the time of the September 2017 meeting."
"  2 One participant did not submit longer -run projections for real output growth, the unemployment rate, or the federal funds rate."
" This participant’s projections over the next several years were informed by the view that the U.S. economy is then step up in the next t hree years; about half of them projected that inflation would be at the Committee’s 2 percent objective in 2019  and 2020, and all judged that inflation would be  within a couple of tenths of a percentage point of the objective in those years ."
 Most participants commented on the effects of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma and judged  that there would likely be some effect on national economic activity and inflation in the  near term but little effect in the medium term.3  Table 1 and figure  1 provide summary statistics for the projections.
" As shown in figure 2, participants generally expected that evolving economic conditions would likely warrant further gradual increases in the federal funds rate to achieve and sustain maximum employment and 2 percent inflation."
" However, because of considerable uncertainty about how the economy will evolve, the actual path of shortterm interest rates, including the federal funds rate, can differ substantially from projections."
" In general, participants viewed the uncertainty attached to their economic projections as broadly similar to the average of the past 20 years, and all p articipants saw the uncertainty associated with their forecast s for real GDP growth , the unemployment rate, and inflation as unchanged from June ."
" Most participants judged the risks around their projections for economic growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as broadly balanced."
" The Outlook for Economic Activity  The median of participants’ projections for the growth rate of real GDP, conditional on their individual assumptions about appropriate monetary policy, was 2.4 percent in 2017, about 2 percent  in 2018 and 2019, characterized by multiple mediumterm regimes, that these regimes are persistent, and that optimal monetary policy is regime dependent."
" Because switches between regimes are difficult to  predict and affect the longer -run outlook, this participant’s forecast did not incorporate convergence to longer -term outcomes for variables other than inflation."

" Compared with the June  Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), the median of the forecasts for real GDP growth for 2017 was a bit higher, while the medians for 2018 and 2019, as well as the median assessment of the longer -run growth rate, were mostly unchanged."

  Figures 3.A and 3.B show the distributions of participants’ projections for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate from 2017 to 2020 and in the longer run.
" The distribution of individu al projections for real GDP growth for this year shifted up, with half of the participants now expecting real GDP growth of 2.4 or 2.5 percent and none seeing it below 2 .2 percent."
" The distribution of projected real GDP growth in 2018  also shifted up a bit, while the distributions in  2019 and in the longer run were broadly similar to the distributions of the June projections."
 The distributions of individual projections for the unemployment rate in 2018 and 2019 shifted down slightly .
"The Outlook for Inflation  The median of projections for headline PCE inflation was 1.6  percent  this year , 1.9 percent next year, and 2 percent in 2019 and 20 20, about unchanged from June."
" Most participants anticipated that inflation would continue to run slightly  below 2  percent in 2018, while no participant s expected inflation above 2  percent in that year."
 About half projected that inflation would be equal to the Committee’s objective in 2019  and 2020; others  projected that inflation would run a little  above  or below  the Committee’s objective in one or both of th ose years .
" The median of projections for core PCE inflation was 1.5 percent in 2017 and 1.9 percent in 2018, a decline of 0.2 percentage point and 0.1 percentage point from June, respectively."
 The median projection for core PCE inflation in 201 9 and 20 20 was 2.0  percent.
 Figures 3.C and 3.D provide information on the distributions of participants’ views about the outlook for inflation.
" The distributions of projections for headline PCE inflation and for core PCE inflation in 2017 moved  down somewhat from June, and the distributions for both measures in 2018 shifted down slightly."
 M ost participants  indicated that the soft readings on inflation  so far this year  were a factor contributing to the revisions in their inflation forecasts.
 Appropriate Monetary Policy Figure 3.E provides the distribution of participants’ judgments regarding the appropriate target or midpoint of the target range for the federal funds rate at the end  of each year from 2017 to 2020 and over the longer run.
" That anticipated pace reflected a few factors, including  a neutral real interest rate that was currently low and was expected to mo ve up only slowly as well as a gradual return of inflation to the Committee’s 2 percent objective."
" Some participants judged that a slightly lower path of the federal funds rate than in their previous projections would likely be appropriate, with a few cit ing a slower rate of progress toward the Committee’s 2 percent inflation objective  than previously expected  or reduced prospects for fiscal stimulus."
" In their discussions of appropriate monetary policy, some of the participants mentioned their  assumptions  for the Committee’s reinvestment policy; all of those who did so anticipated that the Committee would begin its program of balance sheet normalization, described in the Addendum to the Policy Normalization Principles and Plans released in June, before the  end of this year."

" As described in the box “Forecast Uncertainty,” under certain assumptions, there is about a 70 percent probability that actual outcomes for real GDP, unemployment, consumer prices, and the federal funds rate will be in ranges implied by the average size of projection errors made in the past."
" In assessing the path of monetary policy that, in their view, is likely to be most appropriate, FOMC participants take account of the range of possible economic outcomes, the likelihood of  those outcomes, and the potential benefits and costs should they occur."
" Table 2 provides one measure of forecast uncertainty for the change in real GDP, the unemployment rate, and total consumer price inflation—the root mean squared error (RMSE) from forecast errors of various private and government projections made over the past 20 years."
" Participants’ assessments of the current level of uncertainty surrounding their economic projections are shown in the bottom -left panels of figures 4.A, 4.B, and 4.C.  All or nearly all participants viewed the degree of uncertainty attached to their economic projections about GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as broadly similar to the average of the  past 20 years, and all participants saw the degree of uncertainty as unchanged from June .4  In their discussion of the uncertainty attached to their current projections, a few participants judged  that near -term uncertainty for economic activity and inflat ion had increased as a result of the effects of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma  but commented that their assessment of mediumterm prospects was unaffected ."
" Participants’ assessments of the balance of risks to their economic projections are shown in the bottomright panels of figures 4.A, 4.B, and 4.C.  As in June, most participants judged the risks to their projections of real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, headline inflation, and core inflation as broadly balanced —in other words, as broadly consistent with a symmetric fan chart."
" One fewer participant t han in June judged the risks to GDP growth as weighted to the upside , and one fewer participant judged the risks to the unemployment rate as weighted to the down side."
" Also , one fewer participant judged the risks to inflation to be weighted to the upside , and one more viewed the risks as weighted to the downside."
" Participants’ assessments of the future path of the federal funds rate consistent with appropriate policy are also subject to considerable uncertainty, reflecting in part uncertainty about the evolution of GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation over time."

" These RMSEs are not strictly consistent with the SEP projections for the federal funds rate, in part because the SEP projections are not forecasts of the most  likely outcomes but rather reflect each participant’s individual assessment of appropriate monetary policy."
" However, the associated confidence intervals provide a sense of the likely uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables and additional adjustments to monetary policy that may be appropriate to offset the effects of shocks to the economy."
"  To illustrate the uncertainty regarding the appropriate path for monetary policy, f igure 5 shows a fan chart plotting the median SEP projections for the federal funds rate surrounded by confidence intervals derived from the results presented in table 2."
"The conﬁdence interval is not strictly consistent with theprojections for the federal funds rate, primarily because these projections are not forecasts of the likeliest outcomes forthe federal funds rate, but rather projections of participants’ individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy.Still, historical forecast errors provide a broad sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rategenerated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policythat may be appropriate to oﬀset the eﬀects of shocks to the economy.The conﬁdence interval is assumed to be symmetric except when it is truncated at zero—the bottom of the lowesttarget range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted in the past by the Committee."
This truncation wouldnot be intended to indicate the likelihood of the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary policyaccommodation if doing so was judged appropriate.
"Because currentconditions may diﬀer from those that prevailed, on average, over the previous 20 years, the width and shape of theconﬁdence interval estimated on the basis of the historical forecast errors may not reﬂect FOMC participants’ currentassessments of the uncertainty and risks around their projections.* The conﬁdence interval is derived from forecasts of the average level of shortterm interest rates in the fourthquarter of the year indicated; more information about these data is available in table 2."
The shaded area encompassesless than a 70 percent conﬁdence interval if the conﬁdence interval has been truncated at zero.Page 16Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________          Forecast Uncertainty The economic projections provided by the members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks inform discussions of monetary policy among policymakers and can aid public understanding of the basis for policy actions.
" Thus, in setting the stance of monetary policy, participants consider not only what appears to be the most likely economic outcome a s embodied in their projections, but also the range of alternative possibilities, the likelihood of their occurring, and the potential costs to the economy should they occur."
" Table 2 summarizes the average historical accuracy of a range of forecasts, including those reported in past Monetary Policy Report s and those prepared by the Federal Reserve Board’s staff in advance of meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)."
" The corresponding 70  percent confidence intervals for overall inflation would be 1.2 to 2.8  percent in the current year, 0.9 to 3.1 percent in the second year, 0.8 to 3.2  percent in the third year, and 0.9 to 3.1  percent in the fourth year ."
" Figures 4.A through 4.C illustrate these confidence bounds in “fan charts” that are symmetric and centered on the medians of FOMC participants’ projections for GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation."
" In particular, the unemployment rate cannot be negative; furthermore, the risks around a particular projection might be tilted to either the upside or the downside, in which case the corresponding fan chart would be asymmetrically positioned around the median projection."
" These judgments are summarized in the lower -right panels of figures 4.A through 4.C.  As with real activity and inflation, the outlook for the future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable uncertainty."
 This uncertainty arises primarily because each participa nt’s assessment of the appropriate stance of monetary policy depends importantly on the evolution of real activity and inflation over time.
 The final line in table  2 shows the error ranges for forecasts of short -term interest rates.
" It should be noted, however, that these confidence intervals are not strictly consistent with the projections for the federal funds rate, as these projections are not forecasts of the most likely quarterly outcomes but rather are projections of  participants’ individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy and are on an  endof-year basis."
" However, the forecast errors should provide a sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy that would be appropriate to offset the effects of shocks to the economy."
 This approach to the construction of the federal funds rate fan chart would be merely a convention; it would not have any implications for possible future policy decisions regarding the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so were appropriate.
