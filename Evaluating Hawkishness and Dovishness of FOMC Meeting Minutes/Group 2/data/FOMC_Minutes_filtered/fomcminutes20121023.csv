"Swanson, Senior Research Advisor, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco   Thresholds and Forward Guidance A staff presentation focused on the potential effects of using specific threshold valu es of inflation and the unemployment rate to provide forward guidance regarding the timing of the initial increase in the federal funds rate."
" Accordingly, thresholds could increase the probability that market reactions to economic developments would move longerterm interest rates in a manner consistent with the Committee’s view regarding the likely future path of shortterm rates."
" A number of other participants judged that communicating a careful qualitative description of the indicators influencing the Committee’s thinking about current and future monetary policy, or providing more information about the Committee’s policy reaction function, would be more informative than either quantitative thresholds or datebased forward guidance."
" Several pa rticipants were concerned that quantitative thresholds could confuse the public by giving the impression that the FOMC focuses on a small number of economic variables in setting monetary policy, when the Committee in fact uses a wide range of information."
" These issues included whether to specify su ch thresholds in terms of realized or projected values of inflation and the unemployment rate and, in either case, what values for those thresholds would best balance the Committee’s objectives of promoting maximum employment and price stability."
 Another open question was whether to supplement thresholds expressed in terms of the unemployment rate and inflation with additional indicators of economic and financial conditions that might signal a need either to raise the federal funds rate before a threshold is crossed or to de lay until well afterward.
Page 2Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information reviewed at the October 23–24 meeting suggested that economic activity continued to increase at a moderate pace in recent months.
 The unemployment rate declined but was still elevated.
" Consumer price inflation picked up, reflecting higher consumer energy costs, but longerrun inflation expectations remained stable."
"Private nonfarm employment expanded modestly in September, and government employment increased."
" The unemployment rate fell to 7.8 percent, and the labor force participation rate rose slightly."
" The share of workers employed part time for economic reasons increased somewhat and contin ued to be elevated, while the rate of longduration unemployment edged down further but remained high."
" Other indicators of labor market conditions, such as surveys of firms’ job openings and hiring plans and initial claims for unemployment insurance, did not show decided improvement over the intermeeting period."
" In the farm sector, however, drought conditions likely reduced inventory accumulation last quarter and subtracted from overall economic growth."
"The U.S. international trade deficit widened in August, as imports fell less than ex ports."
" Nearterm inflation expectations from the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers declined in September and early October, while longerterm inflation expectations in Minutes of the Meeting of October 23–24, 2012Page 3_____________________________________________________________________________________________the survey moved down to near the lower end of the narrow range where they have remained for some time."
"Foreign economic growth remained sluggish, restrained by weak activity in Europe and the associated spillovers—including through trade—to the rest of the world."
" Euroarea production indica tors signaled continued contraction, and the area’s unemployment rate in August stayed at a historical high."
" In Japan, exports and output declined in the summer months, and growth of real gross domestic product (GDP) for the first half of the year was revised down significantly."
" Data for exports from emerging market economies, especially in Asia, showed a drop, although recently released data for China indicated a pickup in economic activity in the third quarter."
 Foreign inflation rose slightly in some emerging market economies in response to higher food prices but was still generally well contained.
 Monetary policy remained accommodative in most advanced and emerging market economies.
 Staff Review of the Financial Situation Market participants report edly read the September FOMC statement as pointing to a significant increase in monetary policy accommodation.
" At the same time, real yields on Treasury inflationprotected securities (TIPS) decreased somewhat, leaving inflation compensation higher."
" In part, the rise in inflation compensation may have reflected upward pressure on nominal Treasury yields associated with some unwinding of safehaven demands."
" Nonrevolving credit continued to increase at a robust pace, mainly reflecting growth in student and auto loans."
"  Bank credit continued to expand at a moderate rate in the third quarter, with further growth in loans augmented by larger gains in securities holdings."
" In addition, for the second straight quarter, reports of stronger demand were relatively widespread for many types of loans."
"M2 growth picked up somewhat in September, as strong growth in liquid deposits and currency offset ongoing declines in small time deposits and retail money market funds."
" A number of central banks eased monetary policy during the period, including those of Australia, Brazil, Japan, Korea, and Thailand."
"Staff Economic Outlook  In the economic forecast prepared by the staff for the October FOMC meeting, real GDP growth in the near term was revised up relative to the previous projection."
" The staff’s mediumterm projection for real GDP growth also was revised up, most ly reflecting the monetary policy actions announced by the FOMC after the September meeting and the resu lting improved outlook for financial conditions."
" Nonetheless, with fiscal policy assumed to be tighter next year than this year, the staff anticipated that real GDP growth would not materially exceed increases in potential output in 2013."
" In 2014, economic activity was projected to accelerate gradually, supported by a lessening in fiscal policy restraint, gains in consumer and business confidence, further improvements in financial condit ions and credit availability, and accommodative monetary policy."
 Progress in reducing unemployment over the projection period was expected to be relatively slow.
"The staff’s nearterm forecast for inflation was little changed, on balance, from the projection prepared for the September FOMC meeting, notwithstanding recent increases in consumer energy prices."
 The staff’s projection for inflation over the medium term was also essentially unchanged.
" Crude oil prices were anticipated to decline slowly from their current levels, the boost to retail food prices from the drought was expected to be only temporary and relatively small, longrun inflation expectations were assumed to remain stable, and significant resource slack was projected to persist over the projection period."
" As a result, the staff continued to forecast that inflation would be subdued through 2014."
"Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants viewed the information received since the Committee met in September as indicating that economic activity continued to expand at a moderate pace."
" Employment was still rising slowly, and the unemployment rate remained elevated."
" Inflation reMinutes of the Meeting of October 23–24, 2012Page 5_____________________________________________________________________________________________cently picked up somewhat, reflecting higher energy prices, while longerrun inflation expectations remained stable."
" The recent news on household spending, consumer sentiment, and the housing market was encouraging, and most participants expected that highly accommodative monetary policy would provide support for the recovery in the peri od ahead."
" However, many participants saw the uncertainty attending the unresolved U.S. fiscal situation and the ongoing fiscal and financial strains in the euro area as factors likely to restrain the pace of economic growth in coming months."
" Moreover, many participants cited significant downside risks to the outlook that might arise from more widespread weakness in global economic activity or an intensification of strains in gl obal financial markets."
" Regarding inflation, the recent runup in consumer energy prices was expected to subside over the next few months, while the effects of the drought were likely to show through to retail food prices."
" Over the medium term, most participants anticipated that inflation would run at or below the Committee’s 2 percent objective."
"Concerning developments in the household sector, participants observed that the recent news on consumer spending and confidence had been positive, with surveys reporting that households had become noticeably more optimistic about the outlook for unemployment and income."
 Most saw the low levels of mo rtgage interest rates as an important factor contributing to increased housing demand.
" One participant, however, reported that contacts said that insufficient demand remained their principal concern."
" In addition to the uncertainty about the fiscal outlook, manufacturing contacts attributed the weakness in orders and production to softer export demand; one participant added that agricultural exports had also softened."
" Several participants noted that their contacts were concerned not only about the economic slowdown in Europe, but also about whether the recent slowing in economic activity in Asia might persist."
"Page 6Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________In their comments on labo r market developments, participants generally viewed the recent decline in the unemployment rate and continued modest gains in payroll employment, taken together, as consistent with a gradually improving job market."
" However, with economic growth anticipated to stay moderate, some participants expressed concern that the pace of job creation would generate only a slow decline in joblessness."
Participants saw recent price developments as consistent with inflation remaining at or below the Committee’s 2 percent objective over the medium run.
" By various estimates, underlying inflation trends remained subdued, and indicators of longerterm inflation expectations were generally viewed as stable."
" For example, yields on MBS dropped noticeably, leading to a decline in mortgage interest rates, and corporate bond yields generally moved lower."
" The stability in nominal Treasury yields, paired with a decline in TIPS yields, implied a modest increase in inflation compensation, on net, over the intermeeting period."
 A couple of participants saw this increase as a sign that the openended asset purchases posed a risk to the stability of longerterm inflation expectations.
" However, others saw the effect on expected inflation as relatively muted or likely the result of reduced risks of undesirably low inflation."
" A few participants observed that low interest rates had increased demand for riskier financial products, and a couple of participants saw a risk that holding interest rates low for a prolonged period could lead to financial imbalances and imprudent risktaking."
" A number of participants offered the assessment that the Committee’s policy actions, to date, had been effective in making financial conditions more accommodative and that lower interest rates were providing support to aggregate spending, most notably in area s such as housing, autos, and other consumer durables."
" Several added that, based on the experien ce with earlier asset purchases, the broader effects on economic activity from moreaccommodative financial conditions were likely to accrue over time."
" Participants ge nerally agreed that in determining the appropriate size, pace, and composition of further purchases, they would need to carefully assess the efficacy of asset purc hases in fostering stronger economic activity and consider the potential risks and costs of such purchases."
 A couple of participants noted that an extended period of policy accommodation posed an upsi de risk to inflation.
"Committee Policy Action  Members viewed the information on U.S. economic activity received over the intermeeting period as suggesting that the economy wa s, on balance, expanding moderately, with a pickup in household spending and further improvement in housing markets offset to some extent by a slowdown in the business sector."
" Although the unemployment rate declined in recent months, monthly gains in nonfarm payroll jobs remained modest, and many members noted that, without sufficient policy accommodation, economic growth might not be strong enough to generate sustained improvement in the labor market."
 Inflation rose recently because of a temporary runup in energy prices.
" However, longerterm inflation expectations were stable, and over the medium run, inflation was anticipated to run at or below the Committee’s 2 percent objective."
"In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, Committee members generally agreed that their overall assessments of the economic outlook were little changed since their previous meeting."
" Accordingly, all but one member judged th at maintaining the current, highly accommodative stance of monetary policy was warranted in order to fost er a stronger economic recovery in a context of pric e stability."
 Many members saw the adjustments in the Committee’s forward guidance at the September meeting as having been effective in communicating its intention to maintain a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy for a considerable time after the economic re covery strengthens and judged that the guidance remained appropriate at this meeting.
" With respect to the statement to be released following the meeting, members made only relatively small modifications to update the description of recent developments in consumer and business spending and in inflation."
"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct  the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was in structed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: “The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output."
 The System Open Market Account Manager and the Secretary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the System’s balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the Committee’s objectives of maximum employment and price stability.” Page 8Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________The vote encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:15 p.m.: “Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in September suggests that economic activity has continued to expand at a moderate pace in recent months.
" Growth in employment has been slow, and the unemployment rate remains elevated."
" Household spending has advanced a bit more quickly, but growth in business fi xed investment has slowed."
" Inflation recently picked up somewhat, reflecting higher energy prices."
 Longerterm inflation expectations have remained stable.
"Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
" The Committee remains concerned that, without sufficient policy accommodation, economic growth might not be strong enough to generate sustained improvement in labor market conditions."
 The Committee also anticipates that inflation over the medium term likely would run at or below its 2 percent objective.
"To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate, the Committee will continue purchasing additional agency mortgagebacked securities at a pace of $40 billion per month."
" These actions, which together will increase the Committee’s holdings of longerterm securities by about $85 billion each month through the end of the year, should put downward pressure on longerterm interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative."
"To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee expects that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the economic recovery strengthens."
"Mr. Lacker dissented for the same reasons he had cited at the September FOMC meeting, including his view of the likely ineffectiveness of asset purchases and their potential inflationary effect s, as well as the inappropriateness of credit allocation inherent in purchasing MBS."
 He also continued to disagree with the description of the time period over which a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy would remain appropriate and exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate were likely to be warranted.
" The briefing highlighted the important role of the assumed path for monetary policy in constructMinutes of the Meeting of October 23–24, 2012Page 9_____________________________________________________________________________________________ing a consensus forecast and reviewed several alternative approaches for setting such a path."
" However, most participants judged that, given the diversity of their views about the economy’s structure and dynamics, it would be difficult for the Committee to agree on a fully specified longerterm path for monetary policy to incorporate into a quantitative consensus forecast in a timely manner, especially under present conditions in which the policy decision comprises several elements."
" At the end of the discussion, the Chairman asked the subcommittee on communications to explore potential approaches to providing more information about the Committee’s collective judgment regarding the economic outlook and appropriate monetary policy through the SEP."
