"Kahn, Giovanni Olivei, Rania Perry,4 Benedict Wensley,4 and Patricia Zobel,  Vice  President s, Federal Reserve Bank s of Philadelphia, New York, Kansas City, Boston, New York, New York, and New York, respectively   Gara Afonso4 and Scott Sherman,4 Assistant Vice Presidents, Federal Reserve Bank of New York   Nicolas Petrosky -Nadeau, Senior  Research Advisor, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco   Jim Dolmas, Senior Research Economist, Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas   Standing Repurchase Facility  The staff briefed the Committee on the possible role of a standing fixed -rate repurchase agreement (repo) facility as part of the monetary policy implementation framework; a facility of this type would allow counterparties to obtain temporary liquidity at a fixed  rate of interest through repurchase transactions with the Federal Reserve involving their holdings of select securities eligible for open market operations."
" On the one hand, e stablishing the rate at a narrow spread above money market rates would likely provide better interest rate control and could also be helpful in avoiding stigma that can be associated with the use of standing  lending facilities  with fixed rates set well above the level of money market rates."
" A couple of other participants noted ways that a repo facility could have unintended effects on financial stability ; for example, if  reserve s help support  overall financial stability , a facility that significantly reduc ed the demand for reserves might not be beneficial ."
" A few participants noted that the availability of the facility to banks during periods of stress , particularly when they might be in weak financial condition , could be an important factor determining whether a facility would significantly reduce banks’ demand for reserves  in normal times ."
"In their discussion of key objectives for establishing a repo facility , some participants raised questions about whether such a facility is needed in an ample -reserves framework, noting that the current ample -reserves regime has provided good interest rate control."
 Other participants commented on the potential benefits of such a facility as a way to enhance interest rate co ntrol in the current implementation regime or  as a means to operate in the current implementation framework but with a significantly smaller quantity of reserves than at present.
" In response to these developments, markets appeared to become more sensitive to incoming news about the outlook for global growth and inflation, including data that pointed to a continued subdued inflation environment and to slower economic growth in the United States and abroad."
  Treasury yields fell sharply and far -forward measures of inflation compensation dropped significantly in the United States and abroad.
" In the euro area, far -forward measures of inflation compensation fell notic eably, and market participants reportedly increasingly came to believe that further monetary policy accommodation would be needed."
" Euroarea peripheral spreads to German equivalents moved sharply lower , and far -forward inflation compensation recovered modestly."
" Real gross domestic product (GDP) appeared to be rising at a moderate rate in the second quarter, as household spending growth picked up from the weak first quarter while business fixed investment was soft."
" Consumer price inflation, as measured by the 12 -month percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), was below 2 percent in April."
 Survey -based measures of longer -run inflation expectations were  little changed.
" Total nonfarm payroll employment expanded solidly, on average, in April and May ; however,  job gains slowed sharply in May after a strong increase in April."
"  The unemployment rate declined to 3.6  percent in April and remained there in May, its lowest level in 50 years."
" The labor force participation rate moved down somewhat in April and held steady in May, remaining close to its average over the previous few years; the employment -topopulation ratio stayed flat in April and May."
" The unemployment rates for African Americans, Asians, and Hispanics decreased, on net, over April and May and were below their levels at the end of the previous economic expansion, though persistent differentials in unemployment rates across groups remained."
" The rate of private -sector job openings moved up in March and held steady in April, while the rate of quits was unch anged at a high level; the fourweek moving average of initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits through early June was near historically low levels."
" This increase was slower than a year earlier, as core PCE price inflation (which excludes changes in consumer food and energy prices) moved down to 1.6 percent, c onsumer food price inflation remained well below core inflation, and consumer energy price inflation slowed considerably to about the same rate as core inflation."
 The trimmed  mean measure of PCE price inflation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of D alPage 4Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ las was 2.0  percent over that 12 -month period.
" The consumer price index (CP I) rose 1.8 percent over the 12 months ending in May, while core CPI inflation was 2.0 percent."
 Recent survey -based measures of longer -run inflation expectations  were little changed on balance.
Growth in real consumer expenditures appeared to pick up to a solid rate in the second quarter from its weak firstquarter pace.
" Key factors that influence consumer spending —including a low unemployment rate, further gains in real disposable income, and still elevated measures of households’ net worth—were supportive of solid real PCE growth in the near term."
" Orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft declined notably in April and continued to be below the level of shipments, readings on business se ntiment deteriorated further, and analysts’ expectations of firms’ longer -term profit growth moved down sharply."
" Net exports added substantially to real GDP growth in the first quarter, as exports increased robustly and imports fell."
" After widening in March, the nominal trade deficit narrowed in April; even though exports declined, imports declined by more."
 The ava ilable data suggested that net exports would be a small  drag on real GDP growth in the second quarter.
" Growth in the foreign economies remained subdued in the first quarter, as soft growth in the Canadian economy and weakness in several emerging market economies (EMEs) offset somewhat stronger growth in other advanced foreign economies (AFEs) and in China’s economy."
  Recent indicators suggested that the pace of economic activity picked up in Canada in the second quarter but slowed in some other AFEs.  Economic growth also appeared to have slowed in China.
" Foreign inflation remained subdued but rose a bit from lows earlier in the year, in part reflecting higher retail energy prices in many economies."
" However , financing conditions for businesses and households generally remained supportive of economic growth."
" Softer -thanexpected domestic economic news, such as the weaker -thanexpected employment data, also contributed to the declines."
 Measures of inflation compensation derived from Treasury Inflation -Protected Securities also decreased notably over the period along with declines in oil prices.
Overnight interest rates in short -term funding markets declined in response to the technical adjustment that reduced the IOER rate 5 basis points to 2.35 percent after the May FOMC meeting.
" In the AFEs, policy expectations and sovereign yields declined notably, in part reflecting moreaccomm odative monetary policy communications by major central banks."
" Meanwhile, commercial and industrial lending slowed somewhat in April and May after a period of stronger growth in the first quarter."
 Staff Economic Outlook  The projection for U.S. economic activity prepared by the staff for the June FOMC meeting was revised down somewhat on balance.
" Real GDP growth was forecast to slow to a moderate rate in the second quarter and move down to a more modest pace in the second  half of the year, primarily reflecting a more downbeat near -term outlook for business fixed investment."
" The projection for real GDP growth over the medium term was little changed, as the effects of a higher projected path for the broad real dollar and lo wer trajectory for foreign economic growth were largely counterbalanced by a lower projected path for interest rates."
 Real GDP was forecast to expand at a rate a little above the staff’s estimate of potential output growth in 2019 and 2020 and then slow to a pace slightly below potential output growth in 2021.
 The unemployment rate was projected to be roughly flat through 2021 and remain below the staff’s estimate of its longer -run natural rate.
" With labor market conditions judged to be tight, the staff continued to assume that                                                            5 In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, members of the Board of Governors and Federal Reserve  Bank presidents submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2019 through 2021 and over the longer run, based on their individual assessments of the appropriate path projected employment gains would manifest in smallerthan-usual downward pressure on the unemployment rate and in larger -thanusual upward pressure on the labor force participation rate."
 The staff’s forecast for inflation was little changed on balance.
" The forecast for total PCE price inflation this year was revised down somewhat, reflecting a lower nearterm projection for energy prices."
 The core inflation forecast for this year was unchanged  at a level below 2 percent.
"  Both total and core inflation were projected to move up slightly  next year, as the low readings early this year were expected to  be transitory,  but nevertheless to continue  to run  below 2 percent ."
" The staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as generally simila r to the average of the past 20 years, although uncertainty was seen to have increased since the previous forecast."
" Moreover, the staff also judged that the risks to the forecast  for real GDP growth had tilted to the downside, with a skew to the upside for the unemployment rate ."
" With the ris ks to the forecast for economic activity tilted to the downside, the risks to the inflation projection were also viewed as having a downward skew."
" While they continued to view a sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective as the most likely outcomes , many participants attached  significant odds to scenarios with less favorable outcomes .5  Moreover, nearly all participants  in their submissions to the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), had revised down their assessment of the appropriate path of the federal for the federal funds rate."
" The longer -run projections represented each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy."
" Many participants noted that, since the Committee’s previous meeting, the economy appeared to have lost some  momentum  and pointed to a number of factors supporting that view including  recent weak indicators for business confidence, business spending  and manufacturing activity; trade developments ; and signs of slowing global economic growth."
" Many p articipants noted that they viewed the risks to their growth and inflation projections , such as those emanating from greater uncertainty about trade,  as shifting notably over recent weeks and that risks were now weighted to the downside ."
 Private sector analysts had marked down their forecast s for longer -term corporate profit growth .
" In addition, contacts reported that  softer export sales , weaker economic activity abroad, and elevated levels of uncertainty regarding the global outlook were weighing on business sentiment and leading firms to reassess plans for investment  spending ."
" In their discussion of the labor market, participants cited evidence that conditions remained strong, including the very low unemployment rate and the fact that job gains had been solid, on average, in recent months."
" Reports from business contacts pointed to continued strong labor demand, with many firms planning to hire more workers."
 Economy -wide wage growth was seen as being broadly consistent with modest  average rates of labor productivity growth in recent years .
" However, a few participants noted that there were limited  signs of upward pressure on wage inflation."
" A few participants cited the combination of muted inflation pressures, moderate wage growth, and expanding employment as a possible indication that some slack remained in the labor market."
"  Partly reflecting that combination of developments , several participants had revised down their SEP estimates of the long errun normal rate of unemployment."
 Participants noted that readings on overall inflation and  inflation for items other than food and energy had come in lower than expected  over recent months .
" In light of recent softer inflation readings , perceptions of downside risks to growth, and global disinflationary pressures , many participants viewed the risks to the outlook for inflation as weighted to the downside."
" Several  participants indicated that, while headlin e inflation had been close to 2 percent last year, it was noteworthy that inflation had softened this year despi te continued strong labor market conditions ."
 Participants generally noted that they revised down their SEP projections of inflation for the current year in light of recent data .
 They still anticipated that the overall rate of inflation would  firm somewha t and move up to the Committee’s longer -run symmetric objective of 2 percent over the next few years.
"Consistent with that view, s everal participants commented that alternative measures of inflation that removed the Page 8Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ influence of unusually large changes in the prices of individual items in either direction were running around  2 percent ."
"   In their discussion of indicators of inflation expectations, participants generally observed that marketbased measures of inflation compensation had declined and were at low levels."
 Some participa nts also noted that recent readings on some survey measures of consumers’ inflation expectations had declined or stood at historically low levels.
" Many participants further noted that longer -term inflation expectations could be somewhat below levels consistent with the Committee’s 2 percent inflation objective, or that the continued weakness in inflation could prompt expectations to slip further."
 T hese developments might make it more difficult to achieve their inflation objective on a sustained basis .
" However, several participants remarked that inflation expectations appeared to be at levels consistent with the Committee’s 2 percent inflation objective."
"   Participants generally agreed that downside risks to  the outlook for economic activity  had risen materially since their May meeting, particularly those associated with  ongoing trade negotiations and slowing economic growth abroad."
 A few  participants remarked that an upside risk to the outlook for economic activity and inflation included a scenario in which trade negotiations were resolved favorably and business sentiment rebounded sharply.
" While o verall financial conditions remained supportive of growth, those conditions appeared to be premised  importantly  on expectations that the Federal Reserve would ease policy in the near  term to help offset the drag on economic growth stemming from uncertainties  about the global outlook and other downside risks ."
  A few participants pointed to the growth in debt issuance by nonfinancial corporations and still gener ally high asset valuations as developments that warranted continued monitoring.
" In their discussion of monetary policy decisions at this meeting, participants  noted that, under their baseline  outlook, the labor market was likely to remain strong with economic activity growing at a moderate pace ."
" Moreover, i nflation continued  to run below the Committee ’s 2 percent objective; similarly, inflation for items other than food and energy had remained below 2 percent as well."
" In addition, some readings on inflation expectations had been low."
"  A couple of participants favored a cut in the target range at this meeting, judging that a prolonged period with inflation running below 2 pe rcent warranted a more accommodative policy response to firmly center inflation and inflation expectations around the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective."
"   With regard to the outlook for monetary policy beyond this meeting, nearly all participa nts had revised down their as sessment of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate over the projection period in their SEP  submissions , and some had marked down their estimates of the longer -run normal level of the funds rate as well ."
  Many judged additional monetary policy accommodation would be warranted in the near term should these recent developments prove to be sustained and continue to weigh on the economic outlook.
 Some  participants also noted that the continued shortfall in inflation risked a softening of inflation expectations  that could slow the sustained  return of inflation to the Committee’s 2 percent objective.
" Several participants pointed out that they had revised down their estimates of the longer -run normal rate of unemployment and, as a result, saw a smaller upward contribution to inflation pressures from tight resource utilization than they had earlier."
 A few participants were concerned that inflation expectations had already moved below levels consistent w ith the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective and that it was important to provide additional accommodation in the near term to bolster inflation expectations.
 A few participants judged that allowing inflation to run above 2 percent for some time could help strengthen the credibility of the Committee’s commitment to its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective.
"  A few participants expressed the view that with the economy still in a favorable position in terms of the dual mandate, an  easing of policy in an attempt to increase inflation a few tenths of a percentage point risked  overheating the labor markets  and fueling  financial imbalances."
" Several participants observed that the trimmed mean measure of PCE price inflation constructed by the Federal  Reserve B ank of Dallas had stayed near 2  percent recently, underscoring the view that the recent low readings on inflation will prove transitory."
" Committee Policy Action  In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members noted the significant increase in risks and uncertainties attending the economic outlook."
" There were signs of weakness in U.S. business spending, and f oreign economic data were generally disappointing, raising concerns about the strength of global economic growth."
 Inflation press ures remained muted  and some readings on inflation expectations were at low levels .
"  One  member preferred to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points  at this meeting , stating that the Committee should ease policy at this meeting to recenter inflation and inflation expectations at the Committee’s symmetric 2 percen t objective."
" Members agreed that in determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee would assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to the Committee ’s maximum -employm ent and symmetric 2 percent inflation objectives."
" They reiterated that this assessment would take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
" More generally, members noted that decisions regarding nearterm adjustments of the stance of monetary policy would appropriately remain dependent on the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook."
"With regard to the postmeeting statement, members agreed to several adjustments in the description of the economic situation, including a revision in the description of marketbased measures of inflation compensation to recognize the recent fall in inflation compensation."
" The Committee retained the characterization of the most likely outcomes as “sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective ” but added a clause to emphasize that uncertainties about this outlook had increased."
" In describing the monetary policy outlook, members agreed to remove the “patient” language and to emphasize instead that, in light of these uncertainties and muted inflati on pressures, the Committee would closely monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and would act as appropriate to sustain the expansion, with Page 10Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ a strong labor market and  inflation near its symmetric 2 percent objective."
” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p.m.: “Information  received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in May indicates that the labor market remains strong and that economic activity is rising at a moderate rate.
" Job gains have been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low."
" Although growth of household spending appears to have picked up from earlier in the year, indicators of business fixed investment have been soft."
" On a 12 -month basis, overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy are running below 2  percent."
 Market -based measures of inflation compensation have declined; survey -based measures of longer -term inflation expectations are little changed.
" Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
" The Committee continues to view sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and  inflation near the Committee ’s symmetric 2  percent objective as the most likely outcomes, but uncertainties about this outlook have increased."
" In light of these uncertainties and muted inflation pressures, the Committee will closely monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion, with a strong labor market and inflation near its symmetric 2  percent objective."
" In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the targ et range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective."
" This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
Mr. Bullard dissented because he believed that the current stance of monetary policy could be better positioned to foster progress toward the Committee’s statutory objectives of maximum employment and stable prices.
" Particularly in light of persistent low readings on inflation and from indicators of inflation expectations Minutes of the Meeting of June 18–19, 2019Page 11_____________________________________________________________________________________________ along with the risks to the U.S. outlook associated with global economic developments, he noted that a policy rate reduction at the current meeting would help recen-ter inflation and inflation expectations at levels consistent with the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent inflation obj ective and simultaneously provide some insurance against unexpected developments that could slow U.S. economic growth."
" Consistent with the Committee’s decision to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the Board of Governors voted una nimously to leave the interest rates on required and excess reserve balances unchanged at 2.35 percent and voted unanimously to approve establishment of the primary credit rate at the existing level of 3.00 percent, effective June 20, 2019."
" The Fed Listens conferences conducted to date were viewed as successful in identifying many important issues for the stra -tegic review of monetary policy strategy, tools , and communications."
"Clouse  Secretary  Page 12Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________  Summary of Economic Projections   In conjunction with the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting held on June 18 –19, 2019, meeting participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real gross domestic product (GDP) growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2019 to 2021 and over the longer run ."
" Each participant’s projections were based on information available at the time of the meeting, together with his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy —including a path for the federal funds rate and its longer -run value —and assumptions about other factors likely to affect economic outcomes."
" The longer -run projections represent each participant’s assessment of the value to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of furt her shocks to the economy.1  “Appropriate monetary policy” is defined as the future path of policy that each participant deems most likely to foster outcomes for economic activity and inflation that best satisfy his or her individual interpretation of the statutory mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability."
" Participants who submitted longer -run projections generally expected  that, under appropriate monetary policy, growth of real GDP in 2019 would run at or somewhat above their individual estimates of its longer -run rate."
" Thereafter, a lmost all participants expected  real GDP growth to edge down, with the vast majority of participants projecting growth in 2021 to be at or below their estimates of its longer -run rate."
 All part icipants  who submitted longer -run projections continued to expect that the unemployment rate would run at or below their estimates of its longer -run level through 2021.
"  Compared with the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) from March 2019 , most participants  revised down slightly their projections for the unemployment rate from 2019 through 2021 ."
" All participants marked down somewhat their projections for 2019 for total inflation , as measured by the four -quarter percent change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), and almost all did so for their projections for core inflation ."
" All participants projected that inflation would increase  in 2020, from 2019, and  a majority expected  another slight increase in 2021."
"  The vast majority of participants expected that inflation would be at or                                                            1 One participant did not submit longer -run projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, or the federal funds rate."
" Core PCE price  inflation was also expect ed to increase over the projection period, rising to 2.0 percent in 2021."
" As shown in figure  2, just over  half of the participants expected that the evolution of the econ omy, relative to their objectives of maximum employment and 2  percent inflation, would likely warrant keeping the federal funds rate at or slightly above its current level through the end of 2019 ; almost half  projected that a lower level for the federal funds rate would be appropriate by year -end."
" Most participants regarded the uncertainties around their forecasts for GDP growth, total inflation, and core inflation as broadly simila r to the average of the past 20 years."
" About half of the  participants viewed the level of uncertainty around their unemployment rate projections as being similar to the average of the past 20 years , and about the same number viewed uncertainty as higher ."
 Participants ’ assessments of risks to their outlooks for output growth and the unemployment rate shifted notably  relative to their assessments in March .
" As a result, m ost participants viewed the risks for GDP growth as weighted to the downside and for the unemployment rate as weighted to the upside."
" About half of participants viewed the risks to inflation as  being  broadly balanced , with a similar number  viewing  inflation risks as being weighted to the downside ."

" Alm ost all participants continued to expect GDP growth to slow over the projection period , with the median projection at 2.0 percent in 2020 and at 1.8  percent in 2021."
" Relative to the March SEP, the medians of the projections for real GDP growth in 2019 , 2020, 2021, and the longer run were little changed ."
 The median of projections for the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of 2019 was 3.
" These median unemployment rates , along with  the median for the unemployment rate in the longer run,  were a little lower than those from the March SEP."
" A s was the case in March, al most all participants who submitted longer -run projections expected that the unemployment rate in 2021 would be below their estimates of its longer -run level."
 Figures 3.A and 3.B show the distributions of participants’ projections for real GDP growth and the unemployment ra te from 2019 to 2021 and in the longer run.
 The distribution of individual projections for real GDP growth for 2019 through 2021 all shifted up modestly relative to that in the March SEP.
 The distribution for the longer -run growth  rate was little changed .
" The distributions of individual projections for the unemployment rate in 2019 and 2020 moved lower relative to those in March , and the distribution in 2021 edged down  as well."
" Meanwhile, the distribution for the longer -run unemployment rate shifted dow n a touch."
" The Outlook for Inflation  As shown in table  1, the median of projections for total PCE price inflation was 1.5 percent in 2019 , notably lower than in the March SEP , while the median for 2020 , at 1.9 percent, w as a touch lower than in March."
 T he median  for total inflation for 2021 was un changed from March  at 2.0 percent .
" The medians of projections for core PCE price inflation for 2019 and 2020 were 1.8  percent and 1.9 percent, respectively, both a little lower r elative to  the March SEP ."
Figures  3.C and 3.D provide information on the distributions of participants’ views about the outlook for inflation.
" The distribution s of projections for total PCE price inflation and core PCE price inflation in 2019 shifted down notably  from the March SEP, while those for 2020 and 2021 changed more modestly."
" Beyond the current year , for which projections also reflect data in hand, a lmost all  participants expected total and core PCE price inflation to be between 1."
 Appropriate Monetary Policy Figure 3.E shows distributions of participants’ judgments regarding the appropriate target—or midpoint of the target range —for the federal funds rate at the end of each year from 2019 to 2021 and over the longer run.

" Participants’ assessments of the level of uncertainty surrounding their individual economic projections are shown in the bottom -left panels of figures  4.A, 4.B, and 4.C.

" Participants’ assessments of the balance of risks to their current economic projections are shown in the bottom -right panels of figures 4.A, 4.B, and 4.C.  The balance of risks to the projection for real GDP growth shifted lower, with 14 participants assessing the risks as weighted to the downside , 3 assessing them to be broadly balanced , and no participant seeing them  as weighted to the upside."
" Similarly, the balance of risks to the projection for the unemployment rate moved higher, with 12 participants  judging the risks to the unemployment rate as weighted to the upside and 5 participants  viewing the risks as broadly balanced."
" In addition, the balance of risks to the inflation projections shifted down relative to March ."
" Six more participants than in March saw the risks to the inflation projections as weighted to the downside, and no participant judged the risks as weighted to the upside."
" In discussing the uncertainty and risks surrounding their economic projections, trade developments , concerns about global  economic  growth , and weaker business fixed investment  were mentioned by participants as sources of uncertainty or downside risk to the  U.S. economic growth outlook."
" For the inflation outlook, the effect of trade developments was cited as a  source of  upside risk, while the possibility  that inflation expectations could be drifting below levels consistent with the FOMC’s 2 percent inflatio n objective or the potential for a stronger dollar or weaker domestic demand to put downward pressure on inflation were viewed as downside risks."
" Because the Committee adjusts the federal funds rate in response to actual and prospective developments over time in key economic variables such as real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation, used to assess the uncertainty and risks attending the participants’ projections."

"The conﬁdence interval is not strictly consistent with theprojections for the federal funds rate, primarily because these projections are not forecasts of the likeliest outcomes forthe federal funds rate, but rather projections of participants’ individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy.Still, historical forecast errors provide a broad sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rategenerated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policythat may be appropriate to oﬀset the eﬀects of shocks to the economy.The conﬁdence interval is assumed to be symmetric except when it is truncated at zero—the bottom of the lowesttarget range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted in the past by the Committee."
This truncation wouldnot be intended to indicate the likelihood of the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary policyaccommodation if doing so was judged appropriate.
"Because currentconditions may diﬀer from those that prevailed, on average, over the previous 20 years, the width and shape of theconﬁdence interval estimated on the basis of the historical forecast errors may not reﬂect FOMC participants’ currentassessments of the uncertainty and risks around their projections.* The conﬁdence interval is derived from forecasts of the average level of shortterm interest rates in the fourthquarter of the year indicated; more information about these data is available in table 2."
The shaded area encompassesless than a 70 percent conﬁdence interval if the conﬁdence interval has been truncated at zero.Page 16Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________    Forecast Uncertainty The economic projections provided by the members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks inform discussions of monetary policy among policymakers and can aid public understanding of the basis for policy actions.
" Thus, in setting the stance of monetary policy, participants consider not only what appears to be the most likely economic outcome as embodied in their projections, but also the range of alternative possibilities, the likelihood of their occurring, and the potential costs to the economy should they occur."
" Table 2 summarizes the average historical accuracy of a range of forecasts, including those reported in past Monetary Policy Report s and those prepared by the Federal Reserve Board’s staff in advance of meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)."
 The corresponding 70  percent confidence intervals for overall inflation would be 1.3 to 2.7  percent in the current year and 1.0 to 3.0  percent in the second and third years .
" Figures 4.A th rough 4.C illustrate these confidence bounds in “fan charts” that are symmetric and centered on the medians of FOMC participants’ projections for GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation."
" In particular, the unemployment rate cannot be negative; furthermore, the risks around a particular projection might be tilted to either the upside or the downside, in which case the corresponding fan chart would be asymmetrically positioned around the median projection."
" These judgments are summarized in the lower -right panels of figures 4.A through 4.C.  As with real activity and inflation, the outlook for the future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable uncertainty."
 This uncertainty arises primarily because each participant ’s assessment of the appropriate stance of monetary policy depends importantly on the evolution of real activity and inflation over time.
 The final line in table  2 shows the error ranges for forecasts of short -term interest rates.
" It should be noted, however, that these confidence intervals are not strictly consistent with the projections for the federal funds rate, as t hese projections are not forecasts of the most likely quarterly outcomes but rather are projections of participants’ individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy and are on an end -ofyear basis."
" However, the forecast errors should provide a sense  of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy that would be appropriate to offset the effects of shocks to the econom y."
 This approach to the construction of the federal funds rate fan chart would be merely a convention; it would not have any implications for possible future policy decisions regarding the use of  negative interest rates to provide additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so were appropriate.
