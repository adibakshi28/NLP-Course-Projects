" However, the staff noted the un certainties inherent in the analysis, including the difficulties in estimating the effects of changes in SOMA holdings on longerterm interest rates and the economy more generally."
" Under the illustrative “gradual” transition, reinvestments of maturing Treasury holdings, principal payments on agency mortgagebacked securities (MBS), and purchases to accommodate growth in Federal Reserve liabilities would be dir ected to Treasury securities with maturities in the longrun target portfolio."
" Under the illustrative “ac celerated” transition, the reinvestment of principal payments on agency MBS and purchases to accommodate growth in Fe deral Reserve liabilities would be directed to Treasury bills until the weighted average maturity (WAM) of the SOMA portfolio reached the WAM associated with the target portfolio."
"  In its Statement Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation and Balance Sheet Normalization, the Committee noted that it is prepared to adjust the size and composition of the balance sheet to achieve its macroeconomic objectives in a scenario in which the federal funds rate is constrained by the effective lower bound."
"  In their discussion of a shorter maturity portfolio, many participants noted the advantage of increased capacity for the Federal Reserve to conduct an MEP, which could be helpful in providing policy accommodation in a future economic downturn given the secular decline in neutral real interest rates and the associated reduced scope for lowering the federal funds rate in response to negative economic shocks."
" As a result, several participants judged the propo rtional target composition  to be well aligned with the Committee’s previous statements that changes in the ta rget range for the federal funds rate are the primary means by which the Committee adjusts the stance of monetary policy."
"Several participants expressed the view that a decision regarding the longrun composition of the portfolio would not need to be made for some time, and a couple of participants highlighted the importance of making such a decision in the context of the ongoing review of the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy strategies, tools, and communications practices."
" In the United States, prices for equities and other risk assets reportedly were buoyed by perceptions of an accommodative stance of monetary policy, incoming economic data pointing to continued solid economic expansion, and some signs of receding downside risks to the global outlook."
 Softer incoming data on inflation may also have contributed to the downward revision in the expected path of policy.
" In light of the declines in interest rates since November last year, principal payments on the Federal Reserve’s holdings of agency MBS were projected to exceed the $20 billion redemption cap by a modest amount sometime this summer."
" In addition, some market participants po inted to heightened demand for federal funds at month end by some banks in connection with their efforts to meet liquidity coverage ratio requirements as contributing to upward pressure on the federal funds rate."
" Consumer price inflation, as measured by the 12month percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), declined, on net, in recent months and was somewhat below 2 percent in March."
 Surveybased measures of longerrun inflation expectations were little changed.
"Total nonfarm payroll employment recorded a strong gain in March, and the unemployment rate held steady at 3.8 percent."
" The labor force participation rate declined a little in March after having risen, on balance, in the previous few months, and the employmentto-population ratio edged down."
" The unemployment rates for African Americans, Asians, and Hispanics in March were at or below their levels at the end of the previous economic expansion, though persistent differentials in unemployment rates across groups remained."
" The rate of pr ivatesector job openings in February declined slightly from the elevated level that prevailed for much of the past year, while the rate of quits was unchanged at a high level; the fourweek moving average of initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits through midApril wa s near historically low levels."
" The employment cost index for privatesector workers increased 2.8 percent over the 12 months ending in March, the same as a year earlier."
" Key factors that influence consumer spending—including a low unemployment rate, ongoing gains in real labor compensation,  and still elevated measures of households’ net worth—were supportive of solid nearterm gains in consumer expenditures."
"Growth in real private expenditures for business equipment and intellectual property slowed in the first quarter, reflecting both a slower increase in transportation equipment spending after a strong fourthquarter gain and a decline in spending on other types of equipment outside of high tech."
The nominal U.S. international trade deficit narrowed significantly in January and a touch more in February.
 The Bureau of Economic Analysis estimated that the contribution of net exports to real GDP growth in the first quarter was about 1 percentage point.
" This in crease was somewhat slower than a year earlier, as core PCE price inflation (which excludes changes in consumer  food and energy prices) slowed to 1.6 percent, consumer food price inflation was a bit below core inflation, and consumer energy prices were little changed."
 The trimmedmean measure of PCE price inflation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas was 2.0 percent over that 12month period.
" The consumer price index (CPI) rose 1.9 percent over the 12 months ending in March, while core CPI inflation was 2.0 percent."
" Recent readings on surveybased measures of longerrun inflation expectations—including those from the Michigan survey, the Survey of Professional Forecasters, and the Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants—were little changed."
Foreign economic growth in the first quarter was mixed.
" In the advanced foreign economies, economic indicators were downbeat in Japan but elsewhere pointed to some improvement from a weak fourth quarter; GDP growth rebounded in the euro area and also appeared to pick up in Canada and the United Kingdom."
" Foreign inflation slowed further early this year, partly reflecting lower retail energy prices."
 Market participants cited more accommodative th an expected monetary policy communications coupled with strong U.S. and Chinese data releases and positive sentiment about trade negotiations between the United States and China as factors that contributed to these developments.
" Investors cited largerthan-expected downward revisions in FOMC participants’ assessments of the future path of the policy rate in the Summary of Economic Projections, recent communications suggesting a patient approach to monetary policy, and weakerthan-expected euroarea data releases early in the period among factors that contributed to this decrease."
" Measures of inflation compensation based on Treasury Inflation Protected Securities were changed little, on net, and remained below their early fall 2018 levels."
 Banks in the April SLOOS reported weaker demand across all major types of CRE loans.
"  Consumer credit conditions remained broadly supportive of growth in household spending, with all categories of consumer loans recording steady growth in the first quarter."
 The staff also noted that the sustained growth of lending by banks to nonbank financial firms represented an increase in financial interconnectedness.
Staff Economic Outlook The projection for U.S. economic activity prepared by the staff for the April–May FOMC meeting was revised up on net.
" Real GDP growth was forecast to slow in the near term from its solid firs tquarter pace, as sizable contributions from inventory investment and net exports were not expected to persist."
" The projection for real Page 8Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ GDP growth over the medium term was revised up, primarily reflecting a lower assumed path for interest rates, a slightly higher trajectory for equity prices, and somewhat less appreciation of the broad real dollar."
 The staff’s lower path for interest rates reflected a methodological change in how the staff sets its assumptions about the future path for the federal funds rate in its forecast.
 Real GDP was forecast to expand at a rate above the staff’s estimate of potentia l output growth in 2019 and 2020 and then slow to a pa ce below potential output growth in 2021.
" With labor market conditions still judged to be tight, the staff continued to assume that projected employment gains would manifest in sm allerthan-usual downward pressure on the unemployment rate and in largerthan-usual upward pressure on th e labor force participation rate."
"The staff’s forecast for inflation was revised down slightly, reflecting some recent softerthan-expected readings on consumer price inflation that were not expected to persist along with  the staff’s assessment that the level to which inflation would tend to move in the absence of resource slack or supply shocks was a bit lower in the medium term than  previously assumed."
" As a result, core PCE price inflation was expected to move up in the near term but nevertheless to run just below 2 percent over the medium term."
" Total PCE price inflation was forecast to run a bit below core inflation in 2020 and 2021, reflecting project ed declines in energy prices."
"The staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as generally similar to the average of the past 20 years."
 The staff also saw the risks to the forecasts for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate as roughly balanced.
" On the downside, th e softening in some economic indicators since late last year could be the leading edge of a significant slowing in the pace of economic growth."
" Moreover, trade policies and foreign economic developments could move in directions that have significant negative effects on U.S. economic growth."
 Risks to the inflation projection also were seen as balanced.
" The upside risk that inflation could increase more than expected in an economy th at was still projected to be operating notably above potential for an extended period was counterbalanced by the downside risks that recent soft data on consumer prices could persist and that longerterm inflation expectations may be lower than was assumed in the staff for ecast, as well as the possibility that the dollar could appreciate if foreign economic conditions deteriorated."
Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook Participants agreed that labor markets had remained strong over the intermeeting period and that economic activity had risen at a solid rate.
" Job gains had been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate had stayed low."
 Participants also observed that growth in household spending and business fixed investment had slowed in the first quarter.
" Overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy, both measured on a 12month basis, had declined and were running below 2 percent."
" On balance, marketbased measures of inflation compensation had remained low in recent months, and surveybased measures of longerterm inflation expectations were little changed."
"Participants continued to view sustained expansion of economic activity, with strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective as the most likely outcomes."
" Participants noted the unexpected strength in firstquarter GDP growth, but some observed that the composition of growth, with large contributions from inventories and net exports and more modest contributions from consumption and investment, suggested that GDP growth in the near term would likely moderate from its strong pace of last year."
" For this year as a whole, a number of participants mentioned that they had marked up their projections for real GDP growth, reflecting, in part, the strong firstquarter reading."
" Participants cited continuing strength in labor market  conditions, improvements in consumer confidence and in financial conditions, or diminished downside risks both domestically and abroad, as factors likely to support solid growth over the remainder of the year."
" Some participants observed that, in part because of the waning impetus from fiscal policy and past removal of monetary policy accommodation, they expected real GDP growth to slow over the medium term, moving back toward their estimates of trend output growth."
" With the strong jobs market, rising incomes, and upbeat consumer sentiment, growth in PCE in coming months was expected to be solid."
" Several participants also noted that while the housing sector had been a drag on GDP growth for some time, recent data pointed to some signs of stabilization."
" With mortgage rates at their lowest levels in more than a year, a few participants thought that residential construction could begin to make positive contributions to GDP growth in the near term; a few others were less optimistic."
 Participants noted that growth of business fixed investment had moderated in the first quarter relative to the average pace recorded last year and discussed whether this more moderate growth was likely to persist.
" A number of participants expressed optimism that there would be continued growth in capital expenditures this year, albeit probably at a slower pace than in 2018."
"  Several participants observed that financial conditions and business sentiment had continued to improve, consistent with reports from business contacts in a number of Districts; however, a few others reported less buoyant business sentiment  Many participants suggested that their own concerns from earlier in the year about downside risks from slowing global economic growth and the deterioration in financial conditions or similar concerns expressed by their business con tacts had abated to some extent."
"  Participants observed that inflation pressures remained muted and that the most recent data on overall inflation, and inflation for items other than food and energy, had come in lower than expected."
" At least part of the recent softness in inflation could be attributed to idiosyncratic factors that seemed likely to have only transitory effects on inflation, including unusua lly sharp declines in the prices of apparel and of portfolio management services."
 Some research suggests that idiosyncratic factors that largely affected acylical sectors in the economy had accounted for a substantial portion of the fluctuations in inflation over the past couple of years.
" Consistent with the view that recent lower inflation readings could be temporary, a number of participants mentioned the trimmed mean measure of PCE price inflation, produced by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, which removes the influence of unus ually large changes in the prices of individual items in either direction; these participants observed that the trimmed mean measure had been stable at or close to 2 percent over recent months."
" Participants continued to vi ew inflation near the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective as the most likely outcome, but, in light of recent, softer inflation readings, some viewed the downside ri sks to inflation as having increased."
 Some participants also expressed concerns that longterm inflation expectations could be below levels consistent with the Committee’s 2 percent target or at risk of falling below that level.
" Job gains in the March employment report were solid, the unemployment rate remained low, and, while the labor force participation rate moved down a touch, it remained high relative to estimates of its underlying demographically driv en, downward trend."
" A few participants commented that labor market conditions in their Districts were putting upward pressure on compensation levels for lowerwage  jobs, although there were few reports of a broadbased pickup in wage growth."
Participants commented on risks associated with their outlook for economic activity over the medium term.
" Some participants viewed risks to the downside for real GDP growth as having decreased, partly because prospects for a sharp slowdown in global economic growth, particularly in China and Europe, had diminished."
" These improvements notwithstanding, most participants observed that downside risks to  the outlook for growth remain."
" More generally, the improvement in financial conditions was regarded by many participants as providing support for the outlook for economic growth and employment."
 A couple of participants suggested that increases in bank capital in current circumstances with solid economic growth and strong profits could help support financial and macroeconomic stability over the longer run.
"In their discussion of monetary policy, participants agreed that it would be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate at 2¼ to 2½ percent."
" Participants judged that the labor market remained strong, and that information received over the intermeeting period showed that economic activity grew at a solid rate."
" However, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy had declined and were running below the Committee’s 2 percent objective."
" In light of global economic and financial developments as well as muted inflation pressures, participants generally agreed that a patient approach to determining future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate remained appropriate."
" Participants noted that even if global economic and financial conditions continued to improve, a patient approach would likely remain warranted, especially in an environment of continued moderate economic growth and muted inflation pressures."
 Participants discussed the potential policy implications of continued low inflation readings.
" Many participants viewed the recent dip in PCE inflation as likely to be transitory, and participants generally anticipated that a patient approach to policy adjustments was likely to be consistent with sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective."
 Several participants also judged th at patience in adjusting policy was consistent with the Committee’s balanced approach to achieving its objectives in current circumstances in which resource utilization appear ed to be high while inflation continued to run below the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective.
" However, a few participants noted that if the economy evolved as they expected, the Committee would likely need to firm the stance of monetary policy to sustain the economic expansion and keep inflation at levels consistent  with the Committee’s objective, or that the Committee would need to be attentive to the possibility that inflat ion pressures could build quickly in an environment of  tight resource utilization."
" In contrast, a few other participants observed that subdued inflation coupled with real wage gains roughly in line with productivity growth might indicate that resource utilization was not as high as the recent low readings of the unemployment rate by themselves would suggest."
" Several participants commented that if inflation did not show signs of moving up over coming quarters, there was a risk that inflation expectations could become anchored at levels below those consistent with the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective—a development that could make it more difficult to achieve the 2 percent inflation objective on a sustainable basis over the longer run."
" Participants emphasized that their monetary policy decisions would continue to depend on their assessments of the economic outlook and risks to the outlook, as informed by a wide range of data."
"  Committee Policy Action  In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that the information received since the Committee met in March indicated that the labor market remained strong and that economic activity had risen at a solid rate."
" Job gains had been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate had remained low."
 Growth of household spending and business fixed investment had sl owed in the first quarter.
" On a 12month basis, overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy had declined and were running below 2 percent."
" On balance, marketbased measures of inflation compensation had remained low in recent months, and surveybased measures of longerterm inflation expectations were little changed."
" Desp ite solid economic growth and a strong labor market, inflation pressures remained muted."
" Members continued to view sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of April 30–May 1, 2019Page 11 objective as the most likely outcomes for the U.S. economy."
" In light of global economic and financial developments and muted inflation pressures, members concurred that the Committee could be patient as it determined what future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate may be appropriate to support those outcomes."
"After assessing current conditions and the outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, members decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 2¼ to 2½ percent."
" Members agreed that in determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee would assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to the Committee’s maximumem-ployment and symmetric 2 percent inflation objectives."
" They reiterated that this assessment would take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
" More generally, members noted that decisions regarding nearterm adjustments of the stance of monetary policy would appropriately remain dependent on the evolution of the outlook as informed by incoming data."
"With regard to the postmeeting statement, members agreed to remove references to a slowing in the pace of economic growth and littlechanged payroll employment, consistent with stronger incoming information on these indicators."
 The description of growth in household spending and business fixe d investment in the first quarter was revised to recognize that incoming data had confirmed earlier information that suggested these aspects of economic activity had slowed at that time.
 Members also agreed to revi se the description of inflation to note that inflation for items other than food and energy had declined and was now running below 2 percent.
"Members observed that a patient approach to determining future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate would likely remain appropriate for some time, especially in an environment of moderate economic growth and muted inflation pressures, even if global economic and financial conditions continued to improve."
The Committee also directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve’s agency mortgagebacked securities transactions.” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p.m.: “Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in March indicates that the labor market remains strong and that economic activity rose at a solid rate.
" Job gains have been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low."
 Growth of household spending and business fixed investment slowed in the first quarter.
" On a 12month basis, overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy have declined and are running below 2 percent."
" On balPage 12Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ ance, marketbased measures of inflation compensation have remained low in recent months, and surveybased measures of longerterm inflation expectations are little changed."
"Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
" The Committee continues to view sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective as the most likely outcomes."
" In light of global economic and financial developments and muted inflation pressures, the Committee will be patient as it determines what future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate may be appropriate to support these outcomes."
"In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective."
" This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.” Voting for this action:  Jerome H."
"Consistent with the Committee’s decision to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 2¼ to 2½ percent, the Board of Governors voted unanimously to lower the interest rates on required and excess reserve balances to 2.35 percent, ef fective May 2, 2019."
 Setting the interest rate paid on required and excess reserve balances 15 basis points below the top of the target range for the federal funds rate was intended to foster trading in the federal funds market at rates well within the FOMC’s target range.
Update from Subcommi ttee on Communications Governor Clarida reported on the progress of the review of the Federal Reserve’s strategic framework for monetary policy.
" Fed Listens events to hear stakeholders’ views on the strategy, tools, and communications that would best enable the Federal Reserve to meet its statutory objectives of maximum employment and price stability had already taken place in two Federal Reserve Districts."
