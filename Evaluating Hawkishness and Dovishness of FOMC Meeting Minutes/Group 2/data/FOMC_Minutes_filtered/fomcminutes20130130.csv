 The second amendment harmonized the language referring to the Committee’s longerrun objectives with that in the Committee’s Statement on LongerRun Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy.
" Any such adjustment as described in clause (i) shall be made in the context of the Committee’s discussion and decision at its most recent meeting and the Committee’s longrun objectives to foster maximum employment and price stability, and shall be based on economic, financial, and monetary developments during the intermeeting period."
"For this purpose, the overall open position in all foreign currencies is defined as the sum (disregarding signs) of net positions in individual currencies, excluding changes in dollar value due to foreign exchange rate movements and interest accruals."
" For the purpose of providing an investment return on System holdings of foreign currencies or for the purpose of adjusting interest rates paid or received in connection with swap drawings, transactions with foreign central banks may be undertaken at nonmarket exchange rates."
"System operations in foreign currencies shall generally be directed at countering disorderly market conditions, provided that market exchange rates for the U.S. dollar reflect actions and behavior consistent with IMF Article IV, Section 1."
 All participants but one supported making only minor wording changes to the Statement on LongerRun Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy.
" STATEMENT ON LONGERRUN GOALS AND MONETARY POLICY STRATEGY (Amended effective on January 29, 2013)  “The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is firmly committed to fulfilling its statutory mandate from the Congress of promoting maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate longterm interest rates."
 The Committee seeks to explain its monetary policy decisions to the public as clearly as possible.
" Such clarity facilitates wellinformed decisionmaking by households and businesses, reduces economic and financial uncertainty, increase s the effectiveness of monetary policy, and enhances transparency and accountability, which are essential in a democratic society."
" Inflation, employment, and longterm interest rates fluctuate over time in response to economic and financial disturbances."
" Moreover, monetary policy actions tend to influence economic activity and prices with a lag."
" The inflation rate over the longer run is primarily determined by monetary policy, and hence the Committee has the ability to specify a longerrun goal for inflation."
" The Committee judges that inflation at the rate of 2 percent, as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, is most consistent over the longer run with the Federal Reserve’s statutory mandate."
" Communicating this inflation goal clearly to the public helps keep longerterm inflation expectations firmly anchored, thereby fostering price stability and moderate  longterm interest rates and enhancing the Committee’s ability to promote maximum employment in the face of significant economic disturbances."
 The maximum level of employment is largely determined by nonmonetary factors that affect the structure and dynamics of the labor market.
" Consequently, it would not be appropriate to specify a fixed goal for employment; rather, the Committee’s policy decisions must be in formed by assessments of Minutes of the Meeting of January 29–30, 2013Page 7_____________________________________________________________________________________________   the maximum level of employment, recognizing that such assessments are necessa rily uncertain and subject to revision."
 Information about Committee participants’ estimates of the longerrun normal rates of output growth and unemployment is published four times per year in the FOMC’s Summary of Economic Projections.
" For example, in the most recent projections, FOMC participants’ estimates of the longerrun normal rate of unemployment had a central tendency of 5.2 percent to 6.0 percent, unchanged from one year ago but substantially higher than the corresponding interval several years earlier."
" In setting monetary policy, the Committee seeks to mitigate deviations of inflation from its longerrun goal and deviations of employment from the Committee’s assessments of its maximum level."
" However, under circumstances in which the Committee judges that the objectives are not complementary, it follows a balanced approach in promoting them, taking into account the magnitude of the deviations and the potentially different time horizons over which employment and inflation are projected to return to levels judged consistent with its mandate."
"Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information reviewed at the January 29–30 meeting indicated that the expansion in overall economic activity slowed in the fourth quarter of last year, reflecting weatherrelated disrupti ons and other transitory factors, but private domestic final demand grew at a solid rate."
" Employment continued to increase at a moderate pace, and the unemployment rate, though still high, was lower at the end of the fourth quarter than in the preceding quarter."
" Consumer price inflation was subdued, and measures of longerrun inflation expectations remained stable."
"Private nonfarm employment expanded in December at about the same rate as in the fourth quarter as a whole, while government employment decreased."
" The unemployment rate was 7.8 percent in December, below its average in the third quarter, while the labor force participation rate was the same as its thirdquarter average."
" The rate of longduration unemployment and the share of workers employed part time for economic reasons edged down in December, but both measures were still elevated."
" The rate of privatesector hiring, along with indicators of job openings and firms’ hiring plans, was generally muted but remained consistent with continued moderate in creases in employment in the coming months."
"    The U.S. international trade deficit widened substantially in November, as imports rose more quickly than exports."
 Nearterm inflation expectations from the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers rose a little in December and early January; longerterm inflation expectations were unchanged.
 Economic growth in the advanced foreign economies appeared to remain weak in the fourth quarter.
" In emerging market economies, real GDP growth is estimated to have picked up in China in the fourth quarter, consistent with other Chinese indicators that pointed to an improvement in activity."
 Inflation generally remained well contained in both advanced foreign economies and emerging market economies.
"   Treasury coupon yields increased over the intermeeting period, including a notable ri se just after yearend when passage of the American Ta xpayer Relief Act of 2012 apparently lessened concerns about the risk of substantially higher fiscal drag on growth in the near term."
" Morepositive investor sentiment regarding the outlook for global economic growth, along with some optimism about a federal debt ceiling deal, may also have contributed to the increase in yields."
 Measures of inflation compensation derived from nominal and inflationprotected Treasury securities rose slightly over the intermeeting period.
" Nonrevolving credit continued to increase at a robust pace because of growth in student and auto loans, while revolving credit moved roughly sideways."
"Growth of bank credit in the fourth quarter slowed to about half its pace compared with earlier in the year, as loan growth declined."
" According to the January Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices, domestic banks continued to ease somewhat their lending standards and some loan terms, on balance; they also experienced an increase in demand, on net, in most major loan categories in the fourth quarter."
" The monetary base expanded at a strong rate in DePage 10Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________   cember, reflecting growth in both currency and reserve balances."
" At its January meeting, the Bank of Japan restated its monetary policy framework, replacing its inflation goal of 1 percent with an inflation target of       2 percent, and announced it would commence a program of asset purchases in January 2014 with no predetermined limit on the maximum amount ultimately purchased."
"  Staff Economic Outlook In the economic forecast prepared by the staff for the January meeting of the FOMC, the nearterm projection for real GDP growth was revised up, in large part because the fiscal policy legislation enacted in early January was slightly less rest rictive than the staff had assumed."
 The staff’s medi umterm forecast for real GDP growth was essentially unchanged.
" With fiscal policy still anticipated to be tighter this year than last year, the staff expected that increases in real GDP would only moderately exceed the growth rate of potential output."
" In 2014 and 2015, real GDP was projected to accelerate gradually , supported by an eventual lessening of fiscal policy rest raint, increases in consumer and business sentiment, further improvements in credit availability and financial conditions, and accommodative monetary policy."
" The expansion in economic activity was expected to slowly reduce the slack in labor and product markets over the projection period, and progress in reducing the unemployment rate was anticipated to be gradual."
    The staff’s forecast for inflation was little changed from that prepared for the December FOMC meeting.
 The staff continued to project that inflation would be subdued through 2015.
" That forecast is based on the expectation that crude oil prices will trend down slowly from their current levels, the boost to retail food prices from last summer’s drought will be temporary and relatively small, longerrun inflation expectations will remain stable, and significan t resource slack will persist over the forecast period."
"Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook  In their discussion of the economic situation, meeting participants indicated that they viewed the information received during the intermeeting period as suggesting that, apart from some temporary factors that had led to a pause in overall output growth in recent months, the economy remained on a moderate growth path."
" Supported by a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy, the housing sector was strengthening, and the unemployment rate appeared likely to continue its gradual decline."
 Nearly all participants anticipated that inflation over the mediumterm would run at or below the Committee’s 2 percent objective.
" Some participants stated that low interest rates appeared to be contributing to strong sales of autos or, more generally, of consumer durables."
" Holiday shopping reportedly was relatively solid, and, reflecting the improvement in the housing market, demand for home furnishings and construction materials was up."
"Participants remarked on the ongoing recovery in the housing market, pointing variously to rising house prices, growth in residential construction and sales, and the lower inventory of homes for sale."
" A number of particMinutes of the Meeting of January 29–30, 2013Page 11_____________________________________________________________________________________________   ipants thought it likely that  higher home values and low mortgage rates were helping support other sectors of the economy as well, and a couple saw the housing market as having the potential to cause overall growth to be stronger than expected this year."
" Survey data from one District indicated that more than half of the respondents expected to incr ease employment this year, with many citing expected sales growth as the reason."
" The strength of exports repor tedly varied, with indications of higher demand from Mexico but some relatively pessimistic readings from firms about business conditions in Europe."
" Participants generally welcomed an apparent pickup in economic growth in parts of Asia and saw reduced risk that the Chinese economy would slow abruptly, but it was noted that no economy was currently in a position to lead global growth higher."
 Participants generally agreed that fiscal negotiations could develop in a way that would result in significantly greater drag on economic growth than in their baseline outlook.
" One participant noted positive news about the fiscal position of the states; in some  cases, revenues had risen sufficiently to enable incr eases in state government spending and employment."
"In their comments on labo r market developments, participants viewed the decline in the unemployment rate from the third quarter to the fourth and the continued moderate gains in payroll employment as consistent with a gradually improving job market."
" However, the unemployment rate remained well above estimates of its longerrun normal level, and other indicators, such as the share of longterm unemployed and the number of people working part time for economic reasons, suggested that the recovery in the labor market was far from complete."
" One participant reported that firms in his District continued to have difficulty finding workers with suitable skills, suggest ing that labor market mismatch was a factor deterring job growth."
" A few others, however, pointed to evidence that weak aggregate demand was the primary factor restraining job growth, citing data and analyses in support of the view that there was still a substantial margin of slack in the labor market."
" For example, a couple of participants noted evidence suggesting that a shift in the relationship between the unemployment rate and the level of job vacancies in recent years was unlikely to persist as the economy recovered and unemployment benefits returned to customary levels."
" Similarly, one participant cited empirical analysis showing that employment growth was lower in the states where a greater share of small businesses identified lack of demand as their most important business problem."
 Several participants expressed concern that continuation of only slow job growth and persistently high longduration unemployment could lead to permanent damage to the labor market.
Participants generally saw r ecent price developments as consistent with their projections that inflation would remain at or below the Committee’s 2 percent objective over the medium run.
" There was little evidence of wage or cost pressures outside of isolated sectors, and measures of inflation expectations remained stable."
" However, a few participants expressed concerns that the current highly accommodative stance of monetary policy posed upside risks to inflation in the medium or longer term."
Participants also touched on the implications for monetary policy of changes in estimates of the economy’s potential output.
" A number of participants thought that the growth of potential output had been reduced in recent years, possibly in part because restrictive financial conditions and weak economic activity in the Page 12Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________   aftermath of the financial crisis had reduced investment, business formation, and the pace of adoption of new technologies."
" Many of these participants worried that, should the economy continue to operate below potential for too long, re duced investment and underutilization of labor co uld further undermine the growth of potential output over time."
" A couple of participants noted that uncertainties concerning both the level of, and the source of shifts in, potential output made it difficult to base decisions about monetary policy on realtime measures of the output gap."
"  Participants noted that financial conditions appeared to have been supported by the recent fiscal agreement, a perceived reduction in the risk that the debt ceiling would not be raised in a timely manner, accommodative monetary policy, and actions taken by European authorities."
" With regard to Europe, participants continued to see downside risks to growth emanating from that region, given its unresolved imbalances and weak economic outlook."
 Some participants mentioned the potential for a sharp increase in longert erm interest rates to adversely affect financial stab ility and indicated their interest in further work on this topic.
" Most participants commented that the Committee’s asset purchases had been effective in easing financial conditions and helping stimulate economic activity, and many pointed, in particular, to the support that low longerterm interest rates had provided to housing or consumer durable purchases."
" In addition, the Committee’s highly accommodative policy was seen as helping keep inflation over the medium term closer to its longerrun goal of 2 percent than would otherwise have been the case."
" In this regard, several participants stressed the economic and social costs of high unemployment, as well as the potential for negative effects on the economy’s longerterm path of a prolonged period of underutilization of resources."
" Several participants discussed the possible complications that additional purchases could cause for the eventual withdrawal of policy accommodation, a few mentioned the prospect of inflationary risks, and some noted that further asset purchases could foster market behavior that could undermine financial stability."
" Several participants noted that a very large portfolio of longduration assets would, under certain circumstances, expose the Federal Reserve to significant capital losses when these holdings were unwound, but others pointed to offsetting factors and one noted that lo sses would not impede the effective operation of monetary policy."
" A few participants noted examples of past instances in which policymakers had prematurely removed accommodation, with adverse effects on economic growth, employment, and price stability; they also  stressed the importance of communicating the Committee’s commitment to maintaining a highly accommodative stance of policy as long as warranted by economic conditions."
 One participant also indicated a preference for lowering the threshold for the unemployment rate as a means of providing additional accommodation.
" Committee Policy Action Committee members saw the information received over the intermeeting period as suggesting that growth in economic activity had paused in recent months, in large part because of weatherrelated disruptions and other transitory factors."
" Employment had continued to expand at a moderate pace, but the unemployment rate remained elevated."
" However, members generally expected that, with appropriately accommodative monetary policy, economic growth would proceed at a moderate pace and the unemployment rate would gradually decline toward levels they ju dged to be consistent with the Committee’s dual mandate."
" Although members saw strains in global financ ial markets as having eased somewhat, they continued to see an increase in such strains as well as slower global growth and a greaterthan-expected fiscal tightening in the United States as downside risks to the eco nomy."
" Members generally continued to anticipate that, with longerterm inflation expectations stable and slack in resource utilization remaining, inflation over the medium term would run at or below the Committee’s longerrun objective of 2 percent."
"   In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members saw the economic outlook as relatively little changed since the previous meeting."
" Accordingly, all but one member judged that maintaining the highly accommodative stance of monetary policy was warranted in order to foster a stronger economic recovery in a context of price stability."
" The Committee also retained its forward guidance about the federal funds rate, including the thresholds on the unemployment and inflation rates."
 Some members remarked favorably on the move away from providing calendar dates in the forward guidance and toward highlighting the economic conditionality of future monetary policy.
" One member dissented from the Committee’s policy decision, expressing concern that the continued high level of monetary accommodation increased the risks of future economic and financial imbalances and, over time, could cause an increase in longterm inflation expectations."
"In the statement to be released following the meeting, the Committee made relatively small modifications to the language of its December statement, including to acknowledge both the pause in economic growth during the fourth quarter and some  easing of the strains in global financial markets."
"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct  the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: “Consistent with its st atutory mandate, the Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster maximum employment and price stability."
" The System Open Market Account Manager and the Secretary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the System’s balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the Committee’s objectives of maximum employment and price stability.” The vote encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:15 p.m.: “Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in December suggests that growth in economic activity paused in recent months, in large part because of weatherrelated disruptions and other transitory factors."
 Employment has continued to expand at a moderate pace but the unemployment rate remains elevated.
" Inflation has been running somewhat below the Committee’s longerrun objective, apart from temporary variations that largely reflect fluctuations in energy prices."
 Longerterm inflation expectations have remained stable.
"  Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
" The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic growth will proceed at a moderate pace and the unemployment rate will gradually  decline toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate."
 The Committee also anticipates that inflation over the medium term likely will run at or below its 2 percent objective.
"  To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate, the Committee will continue purchasing additional agency mortgagebacked securities at a pace of $40 billion per month and longerterm Treasury securities at a pace of $45 billion per month."
" Taken together, these actions should maintain downward pressure on longerterm interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative."
"  To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee expects that a highly accommodative stance of mone tary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens."
" In particular, the Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to         ¼ percent and currently anticipates that this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6½ percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half Minutes of the Meeting of January 29–30, 2013Page 15_____________________________________________________________________________________________   percentage point above the Committee’s      2 percent longerrun goal, and longerterm inflation expectations continue to be well anchored."
" In determining how long to maintain a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy, the Committee will also consider other information, including additional measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings  on financial developments."
" When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced appr oach consistent with its longerrun goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent.” Voting for this action:   Ben Bernanke, William C."
"Ms. George dissented out of concern that the continued high level of monetary accommodation increased the risks of future economic and financial imbalances and, over time, could cause an increase in inflation expectations."
" Although she noted that monetary policy needed to remain supportive of the economy, Ms. George believed th at policy had become too accommodative and that possible unintended side effects of ongoing asset purchases, posing risks to financial stability and complicating  future monetary policy, argued against continuing on the Committee’s current path."
"Discussion of Communications Regarding Economic Projections As a followup to the FOMC’s discussion in October about providing more information on the Committee’s collective judgment regarding the economic outlook and appropriate monetary policy, the staff presented several options for enhancing the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP)."
