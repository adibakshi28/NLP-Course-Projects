"Hetzel and Samuel Schulhofer -Wohl, Senior Economists, Federal Reserve Banks of Richmond and Minneapolis, respectively    Simple Rules  for Monetary Policy  A staff presentation summarized research on the eff icacy of alternative simple monetary policy rules in fo stering the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy obje ctives of maximum employment and price stability."
Meeting participants expressed a range of views regar ding the appropriate role of policy rules in monetary policy decisionmaking.
 A number of par ticipants ind icated that such rules have played a useful role in i nforming the C ommittee’s monetary policy deliber ations.
Staff Review of the Economic Situation  The information reviewed at the July 31 –August 1 meeting indicated that economic activity increased at a slower pace in the second quarter than earlier in the year and that labor market conditions had improved little in recent months.
" In the second quarter, consumer price inflation was markedly lower than in the first quarter, mostly Page 2Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________reflecting substantial declines in consumer energy   prices, while measures of long errun inflation expectations remained stable."
" Private nonfarm employment expanded in June at about the same modest pace as in the second quarter as a whole, and government employment decreased slightly."
" The unemployment rate was 8.2  percent in June, the same as its average during the first half of the year."
" The rate of long -duration unemployment stayed eleva ted, and the share of workers employed part time for economic reasons was still high."
" While initial claims for unemployment insurance trended down a bit over the intermeeting period , they  remained at a level consistent with continued modest increases in employment in the coming months."
" The U.S. international trade deficit narrowed in May, as exports edged up and imports decline d."
" Near -term inflation expectations from the Michigan Survey rose a little in June and July, while longer -term inflation expectations in the survey continued to be stable."
 The employment cost index rose at a modest pace again in the second quarter.
"Foreign economic growth continued to be su bdued, as fiscal retrenchment and financial stresses in the euro area continued to weigh on economic activity in E urope and elsewhere."
" Foreign inflation eased in the second quarter and remains well  contained, as earl ier declines in the prices of energy and other commod ities passed through to the retail level."
" Generally weaker -thanexpected economic data in the United Stat es, concerns about the fiscal and banking situation in the euro area, and the outlook for global economic growth weighed on investor sentiment."
" However , the effects of these factors were offset to some extent by actual and expected easing of monetary policy in the United States  and abroad and by better -thananticipated profits at some S&P 500 firms."
" Interest rates generally moved down, on net, over the intermeeting period."
" The yield on nominal 10 -year Treasury securities declined to a historically low lev el, partly due to a lower expected path of the federal funds rate, the continuation of the maturity extension pr ogram  announced at the June FOMC meeting, and pe rceptions of an increased likelihood  that the Federal Reserve will ease monetary policy further."
 Anecdotal reports suggested that the decrease in shorter -term yields may also have reflected somewhat increased expectations that the Federal Reserve would reduce the interest rate paid on reserve balances in coming months.
 Near -term indicators of inflation e xpectations derived from nominal and inflationprotected Treasury securities fell modestly despite an increase in some commodity prices; such indicators  changed little  at longer horizons.
" The gradual expansion in total loans was broadly consistent with the July SLOOS, in which domestic banks generally ind icated that demand strengthened for many types of loans in the second quarter and that lending standards eased somewhat, on balance, across most major loan categories."
" Staff Economic Outlook  In the economic forecast prepared by the staff for the July 31–August  1 FOMC meeting, the near -term pr ojection for real GDP growth was revised down somewhat."
" Howe ver, the staff’s medium -term forecast for real GDP growth was little changed, as the slightly weaker underlying pace of ec onomic activity suggested by the recent data was roughly offset by the anticipated effects of the continuation of the maturity extension program a nnounced following the June FOMC meeting, which had  not been incorporated in the previous projection."
" With the restr aint from fiscal policy assumed to increase next year, the staff projected that increases in real GDP would not significantly exceed the growth rate of p otential output in 2013."
" Thereafter, economic activity was expected to accelerate gradually, supported  by an eventual easing in fiscal policy restraint, gains in co nsumer and business sentiment, further improvements in credit conditions, and continued accommodative mon etary policy."
" The expansion in economic activity was anticipated to r educe the substanti al margin of slack in labor and product markets only slowly over the proje ction period, and the unemployment rate was expected to remain eleva ted at the end of 2014."
 The staff’s forecast for inflation was little changed from the projection prepared for the  June FOMC meeting.
" With crude oil prices expected to decline a bit from their current levels, the boost to retail food prices from the current drought in the Midwest anticipated to be only temporary and relatively small, long errun infla tion expectations  remaining stable, and substantial r esource slack persisting over the forecast period, the staff co ntinued to project that inflation would be subdued through 2014."
" Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook  In their discussion of th e economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants agreed that the information received since the Committee met in June su gMinutes of the Meeting of July 31–August 1, 2012Page 5_____________________________________________________________________________________________gested that economic activity had decelerated in recent months to a slower pace than they had anticipa ted."
" Recent monthly gains in payroll employment had continued to be small, and the unemployment rate in June remained at an elevated level."
" Consumer price inflation had been low in recent months , as declines in the costs of crude oil were passed through to re tail energy prices."
 Longer -term inflation expectations had remained stable.
" Regarding the economic outlook, most participants agreed that economic growth was likely to remain moderate over coming quarters and then pick up gra dually."
" However, some participants indicated that they had lowered their near -term forecasts for economic growth  in light of the weaker -thanexpected increases in consumer spending and employment in recent months."
" Given participants’ forecasts of economic ac tivity, they generally anticipated that the unemployment rate would decline only slowly toward levels that participants judge to be consistent with the Committee’s mandate."
 Participants’ assessments of the outlook for inflation were largely unchanged from  those reported in June.
" Smoothing through the effects of fluctuations in food and energy prices, participants anticipated that inflation over the medium term would remain at or below the Committee’s 2 percent longer -run objective."
 A nu mber of participants expressed the view that structural changes in the labor market were not sufficient to e xplain the high level of unemployment.
 Those partic ipants saw substan tial slack in resource u tilization  and hence continued to judge that inflation was likely to remain subdued over the medium term as the economy continued to recover.
" In particular, a couple of pa rticipants noted that they would have expected inflation to have fallen more in recent years if the output gap had been as substantial as some measures  suggested."
" One participant posited that the sharp decline in net worth and reduced credit availability in recent years not only weighed on aggregate demand , but also reduced aggregate supply by hampering new business formation and product innovation; another participant cited ev idence that structural unemployment was elevated  as a result of mismatches between the skills demanded by employers and those of the long -duration unemployed."
" However, contacts in several  Districts indicated that export demand had weakened as a result of the slowdown in economic activity in Europe ; Asia; and some emerging market countries, including China."
 The incoming information on inflation over the inte rmeeting period was  largely in line with participants’ expectations.
" Crude oil prices had turned up again more recently, but one participant noted that global inventories of oil were elevated and, with world demand easing, prices should be restrained going forward."
" In explaining that outlook, participants cited the lack of upward pressure from labor costs and prices of imported commodities as well as the stability of inflation expectations."
" A couple of partic ipants referred to information from business contacts suggesting that inflation was unlikely to decline further, and a few expressed concerns that maintaining a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy for an e xtended per iod could erode the stability of inflation expectations over time and hence posed upside risks to the inflation outlook."
 One participant pointed out that credit risk spreads —while still above prerecession norms —may have been boosted by safe -haven demands for Treasury securities and indicated  that broader financia l market conditions seemed reasonably accommodative.
 It was noted that such an extension  might be particularly effective if done in conjunction with a statement  indicating that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy was likely to be mai ntained  even as the recovery progressed.
 Many participants expected that such a pr ogram could provide additional support for the econo mic recovery  both by putting  downward pressure on  longer -term interest rates and by contributing to easier financial conditions more broadly.
" However, others questioned the possible efficacy of such a program under present circumstan ces, and a couple suggested that the effects on economic activity might be transitory."
 A few participants were co ncerned that an extended period of accomm odation  or an additional largescale asset purchase pr ogram could increase the risks to financial stability or lead to  a rise in  longer -term inflation expectations.
" Some participants commented on other possible tools for adding policy accommodation, including a redu ction in the interest rate paid on required and e xcess reserve balances."
"Committee Policy Action  The information received over the intermeeting period indicated that economic activity had decelerated in r ecent months, with a notable slowing in consumer spending."
" Employment gains continued to be modest, and the unemployment rate was unchanged at a level that almost all members saw as elevated relative to le vels consistent with the Committee’s mandate."
" Inflation had declined from its rate earlier in the year, mainly reflecting lower prices of crude oil and gasoline, and inflation expectations had been stable."
 Members ge nerally expected that economic growth would be mode rate over coming quarters and then would pick up very  gradually.
" While most  members did not view the    medium -run economic outlook as having changed si gnificantly since the June meeting, several noted that they had lowered their expectations for economic growth over coming quarters."
" Furthermore, members genera lly attached an unusually high level of uncertainty to their assessments of the economic outlook and continued to judge that the risks to economic growth were tilted to the downside because of  strains in financial markets stemming from the sovereign debt and banking situation in Europe  as well as  the potential for a significant slowdown in global economic growth and for a sharper -thananticipated  fiscal contraction in the United States."
" A number of members noted that if the recent modest rate of economic growth were to persist, the economy would be less able to weather a material adverse shock without slipping back into recession."
" Most members continued to anticipate that, with longer-term inflation expectations stable and the existing slack in resource utilization being taken up very grad ually, inflation would run over the medium term at a rate at or below  the Committee’s objective of 2 percent."
" In contrast, one member thought that the economy may be operating near its current potential and, thus, th at maintaining the Committee’s current highly accommodative policy stance well into 2014 would pose upside risks to the inflation outlook."
" Nonetheless, many members expected that at the end of 2014, the unemployment rate would still be well above their e stimates of its longer -term normal rate and that inflation would be at or below the Committee’s longer -run o bjective of 2 percent."
 Several  members noted the ben efits of accumulating further info rmation that could  help clarify the contours of the outlook for economic activ ity and inflation as well as the need for further policy action.
" With respect to the statement to be released fo llowing the meeting, members agreed that it should acknowledge the deceleration in economic activity, the small gains in employment, and the slowing in inflation reflected in the economic data over the intermeeting period."
" Because most saw no significant changes in the medium -run outlook, t hey agreed to continue to ind icate that the Committee anticipates a very gradual pickup in economic activity over time and a slow d ecline in unemployment, with inflation at or below the rate that it judges most consistent with its dual ma ndate."
" Co nsistent with the concerns expressed by many members about the slow pace of the economic recovery, the downside risks to economic growth, and the conside rable slack in resource utilization, the Committee deci ded that the statement should conclude by indicating that it will provide additional accommo dation as nee ded to promote a stronger economic recovery and su stained improvement in labor market conditions in a context of price stability."
" At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to ex ecute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  “The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output."
 The System Open Market Account Manager and the Secretary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing deve lopments regarding the System’s balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the Committee’s objectives of maximum e mployment and price stability.”  The vote encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:15 p.m.:  “Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in June su ggests that economic activity decelerated somewhat over the first half of this year.
" Growth in employment has been s low in r ecent months, and the unemployment rate remains elevated."
" Inflation has declined since earlier this year, mainly r eflecting lower prices of crude oil and gas oline, and longer -term inflation expectations have remained stable."
" The Committee expects economic growth to remain mode rMinutes of the Meeting of July 31–August 1, 2012Page 9_____________________________________________________________________________________________ate over coming quarters and then to pick up very gradually."
" Consequently, the Committee anticipates that the unemployment rate will decline only slowly toward levels that it judges to be consistent with its dual mandate."
 The Committee anticipates that inflation over the medium term  will run at or below the rate that it judges most consistent with its dual mandate.
" To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate, the Committee expects to maintain a highly accommodative stance for monetary policy."
" In particular, the Committee decided today to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and currently anticipates that economic conditions —including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run —are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through late 2014."
" In his view, signific ant uncertainty regarding the evolution of economic cond itions over the next few years made the future path of interest rates difficult to forecast, and the Committee’s statement implied more confidence on this score than justified by the current outlook."
" At this meeting, partic ipants discussed various aspects of the exercise, such as the possible monetary policy assumptions  on which to condition an FOMC consensus forecast, the measur ement of the degree of uncertainty surrounding each of the pr ojected variables in the forecast, and the potential for communications benefits."
