Athreya’s selection was  effective upon employment at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
" _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of January 30–31, 2024Page 3 Ahead of the vote on the Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, the Chair indicated the next fiveyear review of the statement would begin in the latter half of this year, and the results would be announced about a year later."
" All participants indicated support for the Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, and the Committee voted unanimously to reaffirm it without revision.5 Developments in Financial Markets and Open Market Operations  The manager turned first to a review of developments in financial markets over the intermeeting period."
" Staff models suggested that the declines in shorter -term yields were mostly attributable to a lower expected policy rate path and were concentrated in expected real rates, while expected inflation was little changed."
 Pricing of inflation derivatives continued to suggest a near -term path of inflation consistent with a return to 2 percent later thi s year.
 The manager turned next to expectations for monetary policy.
 Market participants broadly viewed recent inflation data and the December Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) as increasing the odds that rate cuts might start sooner than previously thought.
Staff Review of the Economic Situation  The data available at the time of the January 30–31 meeting indicated that growth in U.S. real gross domestic product (GDP) was solid in the fourth quarter of 2023 but had stepped down from the third quarter’s strong pace.
" Consumer price inflation had declined markedly over the course of the year, though it remained above 2  percent."
 Labor demand and supply continued to gradually move into better alignment.
 The average monthly pace of nonfarm payroll employment gains in the fourth quarter was slower than in the third quarter.
" The unemployment rate remained at 3.7  percent in December,  the same as its third -quarter average."
" However, the labor force participation rate moved down, as did the employment -topopulation ratio."
" The African American unemployment rate declined , and the rate for Hispanics rose; both rates were higher than those for Asians and for whites."
" Easing labor market imbalances were also apparent in the wage data, with the December 12 -month changes in the employment cost index and in average hourly earnings for all employees each below their year -earlier levels."
 Consumer price inflation continued to slow.
" The price index for total personal consumption expenditures (PCE) increased 2.6  percent over the 12  months ending in December, while core PCE price inflation— which excludes changes in energy prices and many consumer food prices —was  2.9 percent over the same period."
 Both total and core PCE price inflation were well below their year -earlier levels.
" The trimmed mean measure of 12month PCE price inflation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas was 3.3 p ercent in December, also lower than its level a year earlier."
" Survey measures of consumers’ short -run inflation expectations moved lower in December, while survey measures of mediumto longer -term inflation expectations were broadly in line with the levels seen in the decade before the pandemic."
" All told, net exports contributed about ½ percentage point to U.S. GDP growth in the fourth quarter after making roughly neutral contributions in the preceding two quarters."
Foreign economic growth remained subdued in the fourth quarter.
"In the advanced foreign economies  (AFEs) , a significant tightening of monetary policy over the past two years, the erosion of real household incomes from high inflation rates, and the repercussions of last year’s energy shock in Europe continued to weigh on economic activity."
" In China, a propertysector slump and depressed consumer confidence continued to weigh on domestic demand, with the government rolling out a series of policy measures to support growth."
" Economic activity in Asia excluding China firmed, supported in part by rebounding global demand for hightech products."
 Foreign headline inflation continued to fall.
 Most major foreign central banks kept their policy rates unchanged over the intermeeting period and emphasized the need to maintain a stance of policy that is sufficiently restrictive to ensure that inflation falls back to their targets.
" Staff Review of the Financial Situation  Over the intermeeting period, nominal Treasury yields declined , and the expected marketimplied path for the federal funds rate through 2024 shifted downward , as market participants viewed monetary policy communications, on balance, as pointing to notably less restrictive policy than expected."
" Real yields declined more than nominal yields, implying somewhat higher measures of inflation compensation."
 Market -based measures of interest rate uncertainty remained highly elevated by historical standards.
" Rates on loans to households declined over the intermeeting period but remained relatively high, while interest rates on existing credit card accounts were little changed."
 Interest rates on commercial and industrial (C&I) loans and small business loans increased over the intermeeting period.
" Growth in credit card balances was strong in November, though SLOOS respondents indicated that standards for credit cards tightened in the fourth quarter and were expected to tighten further over 2024."
" Nonfinancial business debt growth declined , and the ability of firms to service their debt remained high relative to history."
" The fair value of banks’ longer -term fixed -rate assets, including loans, increased in the fourth quarter as longer -term interest rates decreased, though banks remained vulnerable to significant increases in long erterm interest rates."
"  Page 6Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ Staff Economic Outlook  The economic forecast prepared by the staff for the January meeting was slightly stronger than the December projection, as the upward revision to 2023 GDP growth implied by incoming data boosted the level of output throughout the projection period."
" The lagged effects of earlier monetary policy actions, through their continued contribution to tight financial and credit conditions, were still expected to push output growth in 2024 and 2025 below the staff’s estimate of potential growth; in 2026, output was expected to rise in line with potential."
" The projected path for the unemployment rate was revised d own slightly, reflecting the upward revision to the level of output."
 Total and core PCE price inflation were both projected to step down in 2024 as demand and supply in product and labor markets moved into better alignment.
" By 2026, total and core PCE price inflation were expected to be close to 2  percent."
" Risks around the inflation forecast were seen as tilted slightly to the upside; although inflation had come in close to expectations throughout most of 2023, the staff placed some weight on the possibility that further progress in reducing inflation could take longer than expected."
" The risks around the forecast for real activity were viewed as skewed to the downside, as any substantial setback in reducing inflation might lead to a tightening of financial conditions that would slow the pace of real activity by more than the staff anticipated in their baseline forecast."
" Participants ’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook  In their discussion of current economic conditions, participants noted that recent indicators suggested that economic activity had been expanding at a solid pace."
" Real GDP growth in the fourth quarter of last year came in above 3 percent  at an annual rate, below the strong growth posted in the third quarter but still above most forecasters’ expectations."
" Participants observed that the unexpected strength in real GDP growth in the fourth quarter reflected stronger -thanexpected net exports and inventory investment, which tend to be volatile and may carry little signal for future growth."
" In addition to strong demand, many participants attributed the recent expansion in economic activity to favorable supply developments."
 Participants noted that the pace of  job gains had moderated since early last year but remained strong and that the unemployment rate had remained low.
 Inflation had eased over the past year but remained elevated.
" Regarding the economic outlook, participants judged that the current stance of monetary policy was restrictive and would continue to put downward pressure on economic activity and inflation."
" Accordingly, they expected  that supply and demand in product and labor markets would continue to move into better balance."
"  In light of the policy restraint in place, along with more favorable inflation data amid ongoing improvements in supply conditions, participants viewed the risks to achieving the Committee’s  employment and inflation goals as moving into better balance."
" However, participants noted that the economic outlook was uncertain and that they remained highly attentive to inflation risks."
"In their discussion of inflation, participants observed that inflation had eased over the past year but remained above the Committee’s 2 percent inflation objective."
" They remained concerned that elevated inflation continued to harm households, especially those with limited means to absorb higher prices."
" While the inflation data had indicated significant disinflation in the second half of last year, participants observed that they would be carefully assessing incoming data in judging whether inflation was moving down sustainably toward  2 percent."
  Participants noted improvements in both headline and core inflation and discussed the underlying  components  of these series .
" Although total PCE inflation in December remained above the Committee’s 2 percent objective on a 12month basis, on a 6month basis, total PCE inflation was near 2 percent at an annual  rate, and core PCE inflation was just below 2 percent."
 Participants judged that some of the recent improvement in inflation reflected  idiosyncratic movements in a few series .
" Nevertheless,  they viewed that there had been significant progress recently on inflation returning to the Committee’s longer -run goal ."
 Many participants indicated that they expected core nonhousing services inflation to gradually decline further as the labor market continued to move into better balance and wage growth moderated further.
 Various participants noted that housing services inflation was likely to fall further as the deceleration in rents on new leases continued to pass through to measures of such inflation .
" While many participants pointed to disinflationary pressures associated with improvements in aggregate supply —such as increases in the labor force or better productivity growth— a couple _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of January 30–31, 2024Page 7 of participants judged that the downward pressure on core goods prices from the normalization of supply chains was likely to moderate."
 Participants observed  that longer -term inflation expectations had remained well anchored at a level consistent with the Committee’s 2 percent inflation objective.
" Measures of near -term inflation expectations had also declined recently , in some cases to within their ranges in the years before the pandemic."
"  In their discussion of the household sector, participants observed that consumer spending had been stronger than expected, supported by low unemployment and solid income growth."
" A number  of participants judged that consumption growth was likely to moderate this year, as growth in labor income was expected to slow and pandemic -related excess savings were expected to diminish."
" In a few Districts, contacts reported that the pace of economic activity was steady or solid, while in several others, contacts express ed increased optimism about the economic outlook and prospects for investment."
" Participants noted that the labor market remained tight, but demand and supply in that market had continued to come into better balance."
" Payroll growth had remained strong in the last few months of 2023  but had slowed from its pace seen a year ago, while the unemployment rate remained low."
" While labor market conditions were generally seen as strong, several participants noted that recent job gains were concentrated in a few sectors, which, in their view, pointed to downside risks to the outlook for employment."
" As an upside risk to both inflation and economic activity, participants noted that momentum in aggregate demand may be stronger than currently assessed, especially in light of surprisingly resilient consumer spending last year."
" Furthermore, several participants mentioned the risk that financial conditions were  or could become less restrictive than appropriate, which could add undue momentum to aggregate demand and cause progress on inflation to stall."
" Participants also noted some other sources of upside risks to inflation, including possible disruptions to supply chains from geopolitical developments, a potential rebound in core goods prices as the effects of supply -side improvements dissipate, or the possibility that wage growth remains elevated ."
" Downside risks to inflation and economic activity noted by participants included geopolitical risks  that could result in a material pullback in demand , possible negative spillovers from lower growth in some foreign economies, the risk that financial conditions could remain restrictive for too long, or the possibility that a weakening of household balance sheets could contribute to a greater -thanexpected deceleration in consumption."
 A few participants mentioned  the possibility that economic activity could surprise to the upside and inflation to the downside because of morefavorable -thanex-pected  supply -side developments.
" These participants noted potential risks for some banks associated with increased funding costs, significant reliance on uninsured deposits, unrealized losses on assets Page 8Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ resulting from the rise in longer -term interest rates, or high CRE exposures."
" In their consideration of appropriate monetary policy actions at this meeting, participants noted that recent indicators suggested that economic activity had been expanding at a solid pace."

  Participants continued to be resolute in their commitment to bring  inflation down to the Committee’s 2 percent objective.
" In light of current economic conditions and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation, as well as the balance of risks, all participants judged it appropriate to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5¼ to 5½ percent at this meeting."
" Participants viewed maintaining the current stance of policy as appropriate given the incoming  data, which indicated  that inflation had continued to move toward the Committee’s 2 percent objective and that demand and supply in the labor market had continued to move into better balance."
 They pointed to the decline in inflation seen during 2023 and to growing signs of demand and supply coming into better balance in product and labor markets as informing that view.
 Participants generally noted that they did not expect it would be appropriate to reduce the target range for the federal funds rate until they ha d gained  greater confidence that inflation was  moving sustainably toward 2 percent.
 Many participants remarked that the Committee’s past policy actions and ongoing improvements in supply conditions were working together to move supply and demand  into better balance .
" In discussing  riskmanagement considerations that could bear on the policy outlook, participants remarked that while the risks to achieving the Committee’s employment and inflation goals were moving into better balance, they remained highly attentive to inflation risks ."
" In particular, they saw upside risks to inflation as having diminished but noted that inflation was still above the Committee’s longer -run goal."
" Some participants noted the risk that progress toward price stability could stall, particularl y if aggregate demand  strengthened  or supply -side healing slowed more than expected."
   Participants highlighted the uncertainty associated with how long a restrictive monetary policy stance would need to be maintained.
