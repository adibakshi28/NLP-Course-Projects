" In the United States, the trend toward higher longer -term yields observed in recent months accelerated over the intermeeting period , and farforward real rates based on Treasury Inflation - Protected Securities  (TIPS)  rose considerably ."
 Increased uncertainty over the outlook for longer -term interest rates as well as technical factors may also have contributed to the rise in term premiums.
"  Page 2Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________   Rates implied by interest rate futures maturing over the next several years rose notably over the intermeeting period, reportedly reflecting a reassessment by market participants of the expected path of the target range for the federal funds rate."
 The facility can also alleviate downward pressure on overnight  rates associated with reserve growth by broadening the range of liabilities that support the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet expansion.
" In their discussion following the Desk briefings, participants noted that the ON RRP facility had been very effective in establishing a firm floor for the federal funds rate and supporting monetary policy implementation."
" Participants commented that the facility would continue to be an important part of the monetary policy implementation framework going forward, particularly in Minutes of the Meeting of March 16–17, 2021Page 3_____________________________________________________________________________________________   coming months with reserve levels projected to rise rapidly."
 Staff Review of the Economic Situation  The COVID19 pandemic and the measures undertaken to contain its spread continued to affect economic activity in the United States and abroad.
" Labor market conditions improved in January and February, but employment was still well below its level at the start of 2020."
 Consumer price inflation through January —as measured by the 12 -month percentage change in the price index  for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) —remained well below 2 percent.
 Total nonfarm payroll employment increased solidly over January and February after softening at the end of last year.
" As of February, payroll employment had retraced somewhat more than half of the losses seen since  the onset of the pandemic."
 The unemployment rate fell to 6.2  percent in February.
" The unemployment rates for Hispanics and Asians declined, on balance, over January and February, while the unemployment rate for African Americans was unchanged on net; the rates for both African Americans and Hispanics remained well above the national average."
" Even though the labor force participation rate edged down, the employment -topopulation ratio moved up somewhat over January and February; both measures remained below their prepandemic levels."
 Initial c laims for unemployment insurance in early March were at their lowest level since November of last year.
" Weekly estimates of private -sector payrolls constructed by Federal Reserve Board staff using data provided by the payroll processor ADP indicated that the fourweek average increase in private employment at the end of February was about the same as it had been in the middle of the month, when the Bureau of Labor Statistics collects payroll employment data."
" By contrast, the employment cost index of total hourly compensation in the private sector rose 2.6  percent over the 12 months of last year, and a staff estimate of the 12 -month change in the median wage derived from the ADP data was 3.2  percent in January."
 Total PCE price inflation was 1.5  percent over the 12 months ending in January and continued  to be held down by slack in resource utilization.
" Core PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in consumer energy prices and many consumer food prices, also was 1.5  percent over the 12  months ending in January, while the trimmed mean measure of 12 -month PCE inflation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas was 1.7 percent in January."
" In February, the 12 -month change in the consumer price index (CPI) was 1.7  percent, while core CPI inflation was 1.3  percent over the same period."
 The latest readings on survey -based Page 4Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________   measures of longer -run inflation expectations were little changed on balance.
" In early March, the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers preliminary measure for the next 5  to 10  years was the same as in the previous two months, while in February, the 3 -yearahead measure of inflation expectations produced by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was essentially unchanged from its January level."
" The Survey of Professional Forecasters measure of PCE price inflation over the next  10 years edged up in the first quarter, returning to its prepandemic level."
" A staff index of common inflation expectations, which summarizes the co -movement of a wide variety of inflation expectations measures, was at about the same level in the fourth quarter of last year as in the third quarter."
 Data for December and January showed a narrower nominal U.S.  international trade deficit than in November.
"  Recent data pointed to a slowdown in economic activity across foreign economies around the turn of the year, as tight social -distancing restrictions were imposed to rein in a new wave of COVID -19 infections in various parts of the world, most notably in Europe and Latin America."
" Inflation rebounded in many foreign economies, reflecting rising energy prices and other temporary factors."
" However, underlying  inflationary pressures remained subdued."
" The nominal Treasury yield curve steepened markedly, largely because of increases in longer -term real yields, although  measures of inflation compensation also increased further."
" Despite the spi kes in equity market volatility early in the intermeeting period, spurred by heavy trading concentrated in a few specific stocks and subsequent concerns over the rapid rise in longer -term interest rates, broad equity price indexes rose on net."
" Measures of inflation compensation increased moderately, on net, continuing the trend observed over recent months."
 Swaptionimplied volatilities of longer -term interest rates rose notably.
" Improved U.S. economic growth prospects and optimism about the eventual lifting of social -distancing and related restrictions globally were major drivers of asset prices abroad, spurring sizable increases in sovereign Page 6Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________   yields in advanced foreig n economies."
" Financing conditions for nonfinancial businesses in capital markets remained broadly accommodative over the intermeeting period, supported by low interest rates and high equity valuations."
" Gross issuance of leveraged loans was strong in January, driven mainly by refinancing activity, as primarymarket spreads compressed notably since the end of last year in response to strong investor demand for such loans."
 Commercial and industrial loans outstanding on banks’ balance sheets continued to decline through February as loan paydowns persisted and demand for new bank credit reportedly remained subdued.
 Demand for loans remained depressed —and loan originations fell in December last year to about the same level seen in August —after the spike in lending associated with the first round of the Paycheck Protection Program.
" CRE loan growth at banks was weak, on net, through February, consistent with tight bank lending standards."
" Interest rates on new credit card offers to borrowers with prime credit scores continued to trend down, on net, through December."
" Real GDP growth appeared to be picking  up at the beginning of this year by more than the staff had expected, likely reflecting both a faster -thananticipated easing in social distancing and a more rapid response by households to the fiscal support package enacted in late Decem ber."
" All told, real GDP growth was projected to be substantial this year and the unemployment rate was forecast to decline markedly, as the staff’s projection also continued to anticipate that widespread vaccination would allow for further easing in social distancing this year."
" Real GDP growth was expected to step down in 2022 and 2023 but still outpace that of potential over this period, leading to a decline in the unemployment rate to historically low levels, as monetary policy was assumed to remain highly accommodative."
" Minutes of the Meeting of March 16–17, 2021Page 7_____________________________________________________________________________________________   Incoming data on inflation were a little above what the staff had expected."
" The 12 -month changes in total  and core PCE prices were expected to transitorily move above 2  percent in coming months, as the low inflation readings from the spring of last year dropped out of the calculation window."
" In addition, inflation was forecast to be temporarily boosted this year by the expected emergence of some production bottlenecks and supply constraints."
" Following the transitory increase this year, inflation was projected to run a bit below 2 percent next year and then to reach 2 percent by 2023, reflecting tight resourc e utilization in product and labor markets."
 The staff viewed the risks of upside inflationary pressures as having increased since the previous forecast and now saw the risks to the inflation projection as balanced.
"  Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook  In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2021 through 2023 and over the longer run, based on their individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy, including the path of the federal fu nds rate."
" The longer -run projections represented each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy."
" Following a moderation in the pace of the recovery, indicators of economic activity and employment had turned up recently, although the sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic remained weak."
 Inflation continued to run below  2 percent.
" Participants noted that the path of the economy would depend significantl y on the course of the virus, including progress on vaccinations, and that the ongoing public health crisis would continue to weigh on economic activity, employment, and inflation and posed considerable risks to the economic outlook."
" In light of these developments as well as the extent of the recent fiscal policy support, participants significantly revised up their projections for real GDP growth this year  compared with the projections they submitted last December ."
" They noted, however, that economic activity and employment were currently well below levels consistent with maximum employment."
 A number of participants stressed that recently enacted fiscal support would help address some of the hardships faced by these groups and that monetary policy would also help by promoting the economy’s return to the Committee’s goals of broad -based and inclusive maximum employment and price stability.
 Participants anticipated consumer spending would be bolstered by the recently enacted fiscal stimulus packages as well as by accommodative monetary policy.
 Many participants also pointed to the elevated level of household savings and judged that the release of pentup demand could boost consumption growth further as social distancing waned.
 Participants also observed that residential construction continued to be solid and home Page 8Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________   sales remained robust in part because of low interest rates.
" Participants observed that labor market conditions had improved  recently, as payroll employment registered strong gains in February and the unemployment rate fell to 6.2 percent."
" Even so, payroll employment was about 9.5 million jobs below its prepandemic level , and labor market conditions for those in the most disadvantaged communities were viewed as lagging behind those of other households."
" Moreover, participants noted that employment in the leisure and hospitality sector was still down substantially from its prepandemic level despite a sharp rebound in February."
"  Participants generally expected strong job gains to continue over coming months and into the medium term , supported by accommodative fiscal and monetary policies as well as by continued progress on vaccinations , further reopening of sectors most affected  by the pandemic,  and the associated recovery in economic activity."
" However, participants noted that the economy was far from achieving the Committee’s broad -based and inclusive goal of maximum employment."
 Several participants noted that the speed of the labor market recovery also depended on factors such as the movement of workers across industries and occupations in a restructuring  economy or the effects of technological change on the demand for labor.
  Participants observed that headline PCE inflation  continued to run below 2 percent.
" In the near term, t he  12month change in PCE prices was expected to move above 2 percent as the low inflation readings from the spring of last year drop out of the calculation."
" After the transitory effects of these factors  fade, however, participants generally anticipated that annual inflation readings would  edge down  next year."
" Subsequently, participants expected  that inflation would  likely move along a trajectory consistent with achieving the Committee’s objectives over time , supported by strong aggregate demand , which participants expected would be  driven in part by accommodative monetary and fiscal policies ."
  Participants discussed market - and surveybased measures of longer -term inflation expectations and their implications for the inflation outlook.
" Market -based measures of inf lation compensation at the 5and 10year horizons had continued to move up over the intermeeting period, while survey -based measures of inflation expectations were little changed on balance."
 A number of participants indicated that the increases in marketbased measures of inflation compensation from the very low levels of last spring were consistent with the view that inflation was likely to move along a path over time consistent with the Committee’s goal s.
"Participants noted that overall financial conditions remained highly accommodative, in part reflecting the stance of monetary policy."
" Participants commented on the notable rise in longer -term Treasury yields that occurred over the intermeeting period and generally viewed it as reflecting the improved economic outlook, some firming in inflation expectations, and expectations for increased Treasury debt issuance."
" While generally acknowledging that the medium -term outlook for real GDP growth and employment had improved, participants continued to see the uncertainty surrounding that outlook as elevated."
" With regard to upside risks, some participants pointed to the possibility that fiscal policy could have a more expansionary effect than anticipated, that households could display a greater -thanexpected willingness to spend out of accumulated savings, or that widespread vaccinations and easing of social distancing could result in a more rapid boost to spending and employment than anticipated."
  Most participants noted that they viewed the risks to the outlook for inflation as broadly balanced.
 Several remarked that supply disruptions and strong de mand could push up price inflation more than anticipated.
 Several participants commented that the factors that had contributed to low inflation during the previous expansion could again exert more downward pressure on inflation than expected.
" In their consideration of the stance of monetary policy, participants reaffirmed the Federal Reserve’s commitment to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy during this challenging time, thereby promoting the Committee’s statutory goals of maximum employment and price stability."
" Participants noted that indicators of economic activity and employment had turned up recently after a period of moderation, al -though the sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic remained weak."
" Consequently, participants judged that the current stance of policy and policy guidance remained  appropriate to foster further economic recovery as well as to achieve inflation that averages 2  percent over time and longer -term inflation expectations that remain well anchored at 2 percent."
" Participants also noted the importance of communicating to the public that the existing guidance, together with the new monetary policy framework as delineated in the revised Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, meant that the path of the federal funds rate and the balance sheet depend on actual progress toward reaching the Committee’s maximum -employment and inflation goals."
" Participants noted that it would likely be some time until substantial further progres s toward the Committee’s maximum -employment and price -stability goals would be realized and that, consistent with the Committee’s outcomebased guidance, asset purchases would continue at least at the current pace until then."
" Committee Policy Action  In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that the COVID -19 pandemic was causing tremendous human and economic hardship across the United States and around the world."
" They noted that following a moderation in the pace of the recovery, indicators of economic activity and employment had turned up recently, although  the sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic remained weak."
 Inflation continued to run below 2 percent.
" In addition, members agreed that the ongoing public health crisis continued to weigh on economic act ivity, employment, and inflation and was posing considerable risks to the economic outlook."
" Members agreed that the Federal Reserve was committed to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum -employment and pricestability goals."
" All members reaffirmed that, in accordance with the Committee’s goals to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run and with inflation running persistently below this longer -run goal, they would aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer -term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent."
 Members expected to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until those outcomes were achieved.
" All members agreed to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent, and they expected that it would be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions had reached levels consistent with the Committee ’s assessments of maximum employment and inflation had risen to 2 percent and was on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time."
" In addition, members agreed that it would be appropriate for the Federal Reserve to continue to increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80  billion per month and agency mortgagebacked securities by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress had been made toward the Committee ’s maximum - employment and price -stability goals."
" Members agreed that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and that they would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate in the event that risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals."
" Members also agreed that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments."
" With regard to the postmeeting statement, in light of the notably positive tone of recent data, members judged  that it was appropr iate to incorporate that development in the description of the economic situation with the language that “indicators of economic activity and employment ha ve turned up recently.”  Members also determined that, with oil prices having essentially retraced their pandemicrelated declines , it was appropriate to remove the reference to oil prices as a factor holding down consumer price inflation  and to simply state that “ inflation continues to run below 2 percent.”   Regarding the directive to the Desk, members agreed that the directive should incorporate the proposed increase in the per -counterparty limit for the ON RRP facility to $80 billion."
" • Engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve’s agency MBS transactions.”  The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2:00  p.m.: “The Federal Reserve is committed to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum employment and price stability goals."
" Following a moderation in the pace of the recovery, indicators of economic activity and employment have turned up recently, although the sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic remain weak."
 Inflation continues to run below 2  percent.
" The ongoing public health crisis continues to weigh on economic activity, employment, and inflation, and poses consider able risks to the economic outlook."
 The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2  percent over the longer run.
" With inflation running persistently below this longer -run goal, the Committee will aim to achieve inflation m oderately above 2  percent for some time so that inflation averages 2  percent over time and longer -term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent."
 The Committee expects to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outco mes are achieved.
 The Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0  to ¼ percent and expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee’ s assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2  percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2  percent for some time.
" In addition, the Federal Reserve will continue to increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency  mortgagebacked securities by at least $40  billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward the Committee’s maximum employment and price stability goals."
"  In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook."
 The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals.
" The Committee’s assessments will take  into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.”  Voting for this action:   Jerome H."
" Consistent with the Committee’s decision to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the Board of Governors voted unanimously to leave the interest rates on required and excess reserve balances at 0.10 percent."
