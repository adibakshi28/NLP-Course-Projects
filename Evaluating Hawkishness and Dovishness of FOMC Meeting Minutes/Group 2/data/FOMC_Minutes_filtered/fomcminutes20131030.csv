" The Chairman shall keep the Federal Open Market Committee informed of any changes in rates or fees, and the rates and fees shall be consistent with principles discussed with and guidance provided by the Committee.”  Staff Review of the Economic Situation  In general, the data available at the time of the October 29–30 meeting suggested that economic activity co ntinued to rise at  a moderate pace; the set of information reviewed for this meeting, however, was reduced somewhat by delays in selected statistical releases ass ociated with the partial shutdown of the federal gover nment earlier in the month."
" In the labor market, total payroll employment increased further in September, but the unemployment rate was still high."
" Consumer price inflation continued to be modest, and measures of longer -run inflation  expectations remained stable."
" Private nonfarm employment rose in September but at a slower pace than in the previous month, while total government employment increased at a solid rate."
 The unemployment rate edged down to 7.2  percent in Se ptember; both the labor force participation rate and the employmentto-population ratio were un changed.
" Measures of firms’ hiring plans improved, the rate of job openings increased slightly, and the rate of longduration unemployment declined a little."
" In add ition, initial claims for unemployment insurance rose in the first few weeks of October, likely reflecting, in part, some spillover effects from the government shutdown."
 Growth in real private expenditures for business equipment and intellectual property products appeared to be tepid in the third quarter.
 Real federal government purchases likely dec lined as federal employment edged down further in September and many federal employees were temporarily fu rloughed during the partial government shutdown in October.
"  The U.S. international trade deficit remained about unchanged in August, as both exports and imports were flat."
" Both near - and longer -term inflation expectations from the Thomson R euters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers were little changed, on balance, in September and October."
"    Foreign economic growth appeared to improve in the third qua rter following a sluggish first half, largely r eflecting stronger growth estimated for China and a r ebound in Mexico from contraction in the previous quarter."
" Growth also picked up in the third quarter in the United Kingdom, and available indicators sugge sted an increase in growth in Canada and continued mild recovery in the euro area."
" Economic activity in Japan appeared to have decelerated somewhat from its first -half pace but continued to expand, and inflation mea sured on a 12 -month basis turned positiv e in the middle of this year."
 Inflation elsewhere generally remained subdued.
 Monetary policy stayed highly accommod ative in advanced foreign economies.
" In addition, the Bank of Mexico continued to ease monetary policy, citing concerns about the strength of the economy, but central banks in certain other emerging market econ omies, including Brazil and India, tightened policy and intervened in currency markets in response to concerns about the potential effect of currency depreciation on inflation."
" Staff Review of the Financial Situation  On balance over the intermeeting period, longer -term interest rates declined and equity prices rose, largely in response to expectations for more -accommodative monetary policy."
" Financial market views about the outlook for monetary policy shifted notably following the September FOMC meeting, as the outcome and communications fr om that meeting were seen as more accommodative than expected."
 Concerns about the fiscal situation and somewhat weaker -thanexpected economic data releases also contributed to the change in expectations about the timing of monetary policy actions.
 Fiveand 10year yields on both nominal and inflationprotected Treasury securities declined 30 basis points or more over the intermeeting period.
 The Treasury bill market was particularly affected as yields on bills maturing be tween mid -October and early November rose sharply and some bill auctions saw reduced demand.
" Growth of core loans slowed , primarily because of a sizable decline in outstanding balances of residential mortgages on banks’ books."
" Preliminary data indicated that growth in M2 picked up temporarily in early October amid uncertainty about the passage of debt limit legislation; deposits increased sharply as inst itutional investors appeared to shift from money fund shares to bank deposits, and as money funds increased their bank deposits in anticipation of possible redemptions."
"Staff Economic Outlook  In the economic projection prepared by the staff for the October FOMC meeting, the forecast for growth in real gross domestic product (GDP) in the near term was revised down somewhat from the one prepared for the previous meeting, primar ily reflecting the effects of the federal government shutdown and some data on  consumer spending that were softer than anticipated."
" In contrast, the staff’s mediumterm forecast for real GDP was revised up slightly, mostly reflecting lower projected paths  for the foreign exchange value of the dollar and longer -term interest rates, along with somewhat higher projected paths for equity prices and home values."
" The staff anticipated that the pace of expansion in real GDP this year would be about the same as the growth rate of potential output but continued to pr oject that real GDP would accelerate in 2014 and 2015, supported by an easing in the effects of fiscal policy restraint on economic growth, increases in consumer and business sentiment, further improvements in credit availability and financial conditions, and accommod ative monetary policy."
 Real GDP growth was projected to begin to slow a little in 2016 but to remain above potential output growth.
" The expansion in economic activity was anticipated to sl owly reduce resource slack over the projection period, and the unemployment rate was expected to decline gradually."
 The staff’s forecast for inflation was little changed from the projection prepared for the previous FOMC mee ting.
" The staff continued to expect that inflation would be modest in the second half of this year, but higher than its level in the first half."
" Over the medium term, with long errun inflation expectations assumed to r emain stable, changes in commodity and import prices expected to be relatively small, and slack in labor and product markets persisting over most of the projection period, inflation was projected to run somewhat below the FOMC’s longer -run inflation objecti ve of 2 percent through 2016."
" The downside risks to economic activity included the uncertain effects and  future course of fi scal policy, concerns about the outlook for consumer spending growth, and the potential effects on reside ntial construction of the increase in mortgage rates since the spring."
" With regard to inflation, the staff saw risks both to the downside , that the low rates of core co nsumer price inflation posted earlier this year  could be more persistent than anticipated, and  to the upside, that unanticipated increases in energy or other commodity prices could emerge."
" Although the  incoming data sugges ted that growth in the second half of 2013 might prove somewhat weaker th an many of them had previously anticipated , participants broadly  continued to project the pace of economic activity to pick up ."
" The  acceler ation over the medium term was expected to be bolstered by the gradual abatement of he adwinds that have been slowing the pace of economic recovery —such as household -sector deleveraging, tight credit conditions for some households and businesses, and fiscal r estraint —as well as improved prospects for global growth ."
" A number of participants  noted that their  outlook for stronger economic activity was contingent on a pickup in growth of consum er spending and reviewed the factors that might contri bute to such a development, including  low interest rates, easing of debt burdens, continued gains in employment, lower  gasoline  prices, higher real incomes , and higher household wealth boosted by rising home prices and equity values ."
 A few participants commented that a pickup in the growth rates of economic activity or real disposable income could require  improvements in productivity  growth.
" However, it was noted that slower growth in productivity might have  become the norm."
" Business contacts generally reported continued mode rate growth  in sales, but remain ed cautious  about e xpanding payrolls and capital expenditures ."
" More broadly, fiscal policy , which has been exerting significant restraint on economic growth,  was expected to become somewhat less restrictive over the forecast period ."
" Nonetheless, it was noted that the stance of fiscal policy was likely to remain one of the most important headwinds  restrain ing growth over the medium term ."
"Although a number of participants indicated that the September employment report w as somewhat disa ppointing, they judged that t he labor market continue d to improv e, albeit slowly."
" The drop in the unemployment rate  over the past year , while welcome and significant, could overstate  the degree of improvement in labor market conditions , in part  because of the  decline in the labor force participation rate."
" However , a few participants offered  reasons why recent  readings  on the unemployment rate might provide an accurate assessment , on balance,  of the extent  of improvement in the labor market."
" Finally, revised data showed that the historical relationship between real GDP growth and changes in the unemployment rate had remained broadly in place in recent years, suggesting that the unemployment rate continue d to provide a reasonably accurate signal about the strength of the labor market and the degree of slack in the economy ."
Available information suggested that inflation remained  subdued and below the Committee’s longer -run obje ctive of 2 percent.
" Similarly, longer -run inflation expe ctations remained stable and, by some measures,  below 2 percent."
" Financial conditions eased notably  over the intermee ting period , with declines in long erterm interest rates  and increases in equity values."
" It was noted that interest rate volatil ity was substantially lower than at the time of the Se ptember meeting, and a couple of participants pointed to signs suggesting that reaching -foryield behavior might be increasing again."
" Nev ertheless , term premiums a ppeared to only partially retrace their rise of earlier in the year, and longer -term interest rates remained well above their levels in the spring ."
"  One participant stated that the e xtended period of near -zero interest rates continued to create challenges for the banking industry, as net inte rest margins remained under pressure."
" Policy Planning  After an introductory briefing by the staff,  meeting p articipants had a wideranging discussion of topics related to the path of monetary policy over the medium term, including strategic and communication issues associa ted with the Committee’s asset purchase program  as well as  possibilities for clarifying or strengthening its forward guidance for the federal funds rate."
 A number of participants noted that recent movements in interest rates and other indicators suggested that financial market s viewed the Committee’s tools —asset purchases and forward gui dance regarding the federal funds rate —as closely linked .
" A couple of participants observed that the decision at the September FOMC meeting might have strengthened the credibility of monetary policy , as suggested by the downward shift in the expected path of short -term i nterest rates that  had brought the  path more closely into alignment with the Committee’s forward guidance ."
Participants generally  expressed reservations about the possibility of introducing a simple mechanical rule that would adjust the pace of asset purchases automatically based on a single variable such as the unemployment rate or payroll employ ment.
" A couple of participants favored simply reducing the 6½ percent unemployment rate threshold, but others noted that such a change might raise concerns about the durability of the Co mmittee’s commitment to the thresholds ."
" Participants also weighed the merits of stating that, even after the unemployment rate dropped below 6½ percent,  the target for the federal funds rate would not be raised so long as  the inflation rate was projected to run below a given level."
" In general, the benefits of adding  this kind of quantitative floor for inflation were viewed as unce rtain and likely to be rather modest, and communicating  it could present challenges , but a fe w participants r emained  favorably inclined toward it ."
 Several  partic ipants concluded  that provid ing additional qualitative information on the Committee’s intentions regarding the federal funds rate after the unemployment thres hold was reached  could be more helpful.
" For example, m ost participants thought that a redu ction by the Board of Governors in  the interest rate pai d on excess reserves could be worth considering at some stage, although the benefits of such a step were genera lly seen as likely to be small  except possibly as a sign al of policy intentions ."
" By contrast, participants e xpressed a range of concerns about using open market operations  aimed at affecting the expected path of shortterm interest rates , such as a standing purchase facility for shorter -term Treasury securities or the pr ovision of term funding through repurchase  agreements ."
" Although indicat ors of labor market conditions had shown some further improvement, the unemployment rate remained elevated."
"  Household spending and business fixed investment advanced, but  the recovery in the housing sector slowed somewhat in recent months, and fiscal policy was restraining economic growth."
" The Committee expected that, with appropr iate policy accommodation, economic growth would pick up from its recent pace , resulting in a gradual d ecline in  the unemployment rate toward levels consistent with the Committee’s dual mandate."
" I nflation was running below the Committee’s longer -run objective, but longer -term inflation expectations were stable, and the Co mmittee anticipated that inflation would move back t oward its obje ctive over the medium term."
" Members recognized, however, that inflation persistently below the Committee’s  2 percent objective could pose risks to economic performance."
" In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead,  members generally noted that there had been little change in the  economic  outlook since the Se ptember meeting , and all members but one again judged that it would be appropriate for the Committee to await more evidence that progress toward its economic objectives would be sustained  before adjusting the pace of asset purchases."
"  In the view of one member, the c umulative improvement in the economy indicated that the continued easing of  monetary policy at the current pace was no longer necessary ."
" A couple of members also commented that it would be important to continue laying  the groundwork for such a reduction in pace through public statements and speeches , while emphasizing that the overall stance of monetary policy would remain highly accommodative as needed to meet the  Committee’s objectives ."
" In addition, the Committee rea ffirmed its intention to keep the target federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and retained its forward guidance that it anticipates that this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6½ percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee’s 2 percent longer -run goal , and longer -term inflation expectations continue to be well a nchored."
" At the conclusion of  the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to ex ecute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  “Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster maximum employment and price stability."
 The System Open Market Account Manager and the Se cretary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the Sy stem’s balance sheet that could affect the a ttainment over time of the Committee’s o bjectives of maximum employment and price stability.”  The vote encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p.m.:  “Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in September generally sugges ts that economic activity has continued to expand at a moderate pace.
" I ndicators of labor market conditions have shown some further improvement, but the unemployment rate remains elevated."
 Fiscal policy is restraining economic growth.
" Apart from fluctuations due to changes in energy prices, inflation has been running below the Committee’s longe rrun objective, but   longer -term inflation expectations have r emained stable."
" The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy a ccommodation,  economic growth will pick up from its recent pace and the unemployment rate will gradually decline toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate."
" The Committee recognizes that inflation persistently below its 2 percent objective could pose risks to economic pe rformance, but it anticipates that inflation will move back toward its objective over the medium term."
" Taken together, these actions should maintain downward pressure on longer -term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to mak e broader financial conditions more accommodative, which in turn should promote a stronger economic recovery and help to ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with the Committee’s dual mandate."
" In judging when to moderate the pace of asset purchases, the Committee will, at its coming meetings, assess whether incoming information continues to support the Commi ttee’s expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back toward its longer -run objective."
"To support continued progress toward ma ximum employment and price stability, the Committee today reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropr iate for a conside rable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens."
" In particular, the Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at  0 to ¼ percent and currently anticipates that this excep tionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above  6½ percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee’s 2 percent longer -run goal, and longer -term inflation expectations continue to be well a nchored."
" In determining how long to mai ntain a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy, the Committee will also consider other information, including additional measures of labor market conditions, indic ators of inflation pressures and inflation e xpectations, and readings on financial deve lopments."
" When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer -run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent.”  Voting for this action:  Ben Bernanke, William C."
 Ms. George dissented because she did not see the co ntinued aggressive easing of monetary policy as warran ted in the face of both actual and forecasted improv ements in the economy.
" Under certain circumstances, the Desk might act to facilitate the smooth transmission of monetary policy through money markets and to address disruptions in  market functioning and liquidity."
