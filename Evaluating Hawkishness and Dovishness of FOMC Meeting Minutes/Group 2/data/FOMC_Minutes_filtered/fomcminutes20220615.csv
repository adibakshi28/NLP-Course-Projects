" After the release of the higherthan-expected inflation data, policysensitive rates pointed instead to a considerable probability of 75 basis point moves at both the June and July meetings."
 Market participants noted elevated uncertainty about the economic and monetary policy outlook.
"Across the yield curve, rates on nominal Treasury securities ended the period significantly higher, primarily reflecting the revision in the outlook for monetary policy and the associated rise in real yields."
" Marketbased measures of inflation compensation continued to indicate expectations that inflation would decline notably in coming quarters, and measures of mediumterm inflation compensation fell over the intermeeting period."
" Responding to higher inPage 2Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ terest rates and some concerns about the growth outlook, equity prices moved substantially lower over the period."
 Most major foreign central banks were proceeding on a path of removing policy accommodation in order to address elevated levels of inflation.
" Meanwhile, the stance of monetary policy in Japan was generally expected to remain highly accommodative, though recent upward pressure on Japanese government bond yields had led the Bank of Japan (BOJ) to step up its efforts to defend its yield curve control target."
" On balance, market participants were focused on the largely synchronous shift toward monetary policy tightening across most advanced economies."
" Contacts attributed the downward pressure on secured rates to high liquidity levels and declining Treasury bill supply, as well as elevat ed uncertainty about the interest rate path, which had increased demand for shortterm investments."
" As note d in the recent SOMA annual report and reported in the Board’s firstquarter financial statements for the Federal Reserve System, the SOMA portfolio had an unre alized loss, reflecting the increase in longerterm interest rates."
 Neither unrealized losses on the Federal Reserve’s existing securities portfolio nor negative net income would impair the implementation of monetary policy or the Federal Reserve’s ability to achi eve its dualmandate objectives.
" Consumer price inflation—as measured by the 12‑month percentag e change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE)—remained elevated in April, and available information suggested that inflation was still elevated in May."
"Total nonfarm payroll employme nt rose solidly in April and May, though the pace of increase was slower than in the first quarter, and the unemployment rate remained unchanged at 3.6 percent."
" The unemployment rates for African Americans and for Hispanics were little Minutes of the Meeting of June 14–15, 2022Page 3_____________________________________________________________________________________________ changed, on net, though both rates remained noticeably higher than the national average."
" On net, the labor force participation rate edged down between March and May, while the employmentto-population ratio was unchanged."
" Nominal wage growth remained elevated, with average hourly earnings having risen 5.2 percent over the 12 months ending in May, and the incr eases were widespread across industries."
 Consumer price inflation rema ined elevated.
" Total PCE price inflation was 6.3 percent over the 12 months ending in April, and core PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in consumer energy prices and many consumer food prices, was 4.9 percent over the same period."
" The trimmed mean measure of 12‑month PCE price inflation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas was 3.8 percent in April, nearly 2 percentage points higher than its yearearlier rate of increase."
" In May, the 12month change in  the CPI was 8.6 percent, while core CPI inflation was 6.0 percent over the same period."
 Measures of inflation expectations derived from surveys of professional forecasters and of consumers generally suggested that inflation was expected to remain high in the short run but then fall back toward levels consistent with a longerrun rate of 2 percent.
" And with the available trade data for April pointing to a rebound in exports and a moderation in import growth in the second quarter, GDP growth appeared to be rebounding after having declined in the first quarter."
 The nominal U.S. international trade deficit widened to a record size in March and then reversed that widening in April.
Incoming data suggested that the global reverberations from lockdown measures to deal with the spread of the COVID19 virus in China an d the Russian invasion of Ukraine slowed foreign economic growth.
" In China, activity indicators pointed to a sizable restraint on economic activity."
"Inflation abroad moved higher, driven by further increases in consumer energy and food prices as well as some additional broadening of price pressures to core goods and services."
 Central banks around the world further tightened their monetary policy stances to curb high inflation.
"Early in the intermeeting period, Treasury yields moved lower amid rising concerns about a weakening U.S. growth outlook and Federal Reserve communications perceived as lowering the chances of large policy rate hikes at upcoming meetings."
" However, yields increased late in the period, with economic data releases largely being interpreted as highlighting the possibility of a more aggressive tightening of monetary policy."
" Real yields increased more than their nominal Page 4Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ counterparts, while inflation compensation implied by Treasury InflationProtected Securities declined."
This widening of spreads wa s associated with increased concerns about the outlook for corporate credit amid monetary policy tightening.
" Since the previous FOMC meeting, spreads on municipal bonds narrowed substantially, on net, moving near levels observed for several years before the pandemic, as investor demand exhibited some recovery over much of the period from earlier weak levels."
" Secured overnight rates softened significantly relative to the ON RRP offering rate since the May FOMC meeting, with the downward pressure on rates attributed to continuing declines in net Treasury bill issuance, elevated demand for collateral in  the form of Treasury securities, and MMFs maintaining very short portfolio maturities amid uncertainty about the pace of anticipated policy rate increases."
Sovereign yields in most AFEs rose over the intermeeting period amid investors’ concerns about further inflationary pressures and major central banks’ policy communications suggesting a firmer stance of policy.
" Interest rate volatility in AFEs increased, consistent with increased uncertainty about the path of policy rates."
" Concerns about the global growth outlook weighed on equity prices, and the broad do llar edged up."
" Japanese yields and equity prices, however, ended the period about unchanged, as the BOJ reaffirmed its accommodative monetary policy stance."
" Credit card balances at commercial banks rose in April at the fastest pace seen in recent decades, but growth slowed in May."
 Bank interest rates for both C&I and CRE loans also increased.
Staff Economic Outlook The projection for U.S. economic activity prepared by the staff for the June FOMC meeting implied a trajectory for real GDP that was lower than in the May projection.
The staff continued to project that GDP growth would rebound in the second quarter and remain solid over the remainder of the year.
" However, monetary policy was assumed to be less accommodative than in the previous projection, and the recent and prospective tightening of financial conditions led the staff to reduce its GDP growth forecast for the s econd half of 2022 and for 2023."
"With regard to PCE price inflation, the staff revised up its projection for the second half of 2022 in response to strongerthan-expected wage growth and the staff’s assessment that the boost to inflation from supply– demand imbalances in the economy, including in food and energy markets, would be more persistent than previously assumed."
" All told, total PCE price inflation was expected to be 5.0 percent in 2022, while core inflation was expected to be 4.1 percent."
" PCE price inflation was then expected to step down to 2.4 percent in 2023 and to 2.0 percent in 2024, as ener gy prices were forecast to decline and as supply–demand imbalances were projected to diminish because of slowing aggregate demand and an easing of supply constraints."
" Similarly, core inflation was projected to slow to 2.6 percent in 2023 and to 2.2 percent in 2024."
The staff continued to judge that the risks to the baseline projection for real activity were skewed to the downside and that the risks to the inflation projection were skewed to the upside.
"Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2022 through 2024 and over the longer run based on their individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy, including the path of the federal funds rate."
" The longerrun projections represented each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of Page 6Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ further shocks to the economy."
"In their discussion of current economic conditions, participants noted that overall economic activity appeared to have picked up after edging down in the first quarter."
"Job gains had been robust in  recent months, and the unemployment rate had remained low."
" Inflation remained elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher energy prices, and broader price pressures."
Participants judged that the invasion and related events were creating additional upward pressure on inflation and were weighing on global economic activity.
" Against this background, participants stated that they were highly attentive to inflation risks."
"With regard to the economic outlook, participants noted that recent indicators suggested that real GDP growth was expanding in the current quarter, with consumption spending remaining strong."
" Participants generally judged that growth in business fixed investment appeared to be slowing, and activity in the housing sector appeared to be softening, in part as a result of a sharp rise in mortgage rates."
" Co rrespondingly, participants indicated that they had revised down their projections of real GDP growth for this year, consistent with ongoing supply chain disruptions and tighter financial conditions."
Participants noted that the imbalance between supply and demand across a wide range of product markets was contributing to upward pressu re on inflation.
 They saw an appropriate firming of monetary policy and associated tighter financial conditions as playing a central role in helping address this imba lance and in supporting the Federal Reserve’s goals of maximum employment and price stability.
" An easing of supply bottlenecks, a further rise in labor force participation, and the waning effects of pandemicrelated fiscal policy support were cited as additional factors that could help reduce the supply– demand imbalances in the economy and therefore lower inflation over the next few years."
" Participants generally expected higher mortgage interest rates to contribute to further declines in home sale s, and a couple of participants noted that housing activity in their Districts had begun to slow noticeably."
Participants noted that the demand for labor continued to outstrip available supply across many parts of the economy.
" These indicators included an unem ployment rate near a 50year low, job vacancies at historical highs, and elevated nominal wage Minutes of the Meeting of June 14–15, 2022Page 7_____________________________________________________________________________________________ growth."
"Employment growth, while moderating somewhat from its pace earlier in the year, had remained robust."
" A couple of participants raised th e possibility that tight labor markets would spur investment  in automation by firms, boosting labor productivity."
"While labor markets were anticipated to remain tight in the near term, participants expected labor demand and supply to come into better balance over time, helping to ease upward pressure on wages and prices."
" As in the case of product markets, they anticipated that an appropriate firming of monetary policy would play a central role in helping address imbala nces in the labor market."
"With the tightness in labor markets anticipated to diminish over time, participants generally expected the unemployment rate to increase, as the median projection of the unemployment rate in the June SEP showed a gradual rise over the next few years, reaching 4.1 percent in 2024."
" In light of the very hi gh level of job vacancies, a number of participants judg ed that the expected moderation in labor demand relative to supply might primarily affect vacancies and have a less significant effect on the unemployment rate."
"Participants noted that inflation remained much too high and observed that it continued to run well above the Committee’s longerrun 2 percent objective, with total PCE prices having risen 6.3 percent over the 12 months ending in April."
" Participants we re concerned that the MayCPI release indicated that inflation pressures had yet toshow signs of abating, and a number of them saw it assolidifying the view that infl ation would be more persistent than they had previously anticipated."
" They commented on the hardship caused by elevated inflation,with lowand moderateincome households especiallyaffected."
 Participants also stressed that persistently high inflation would impede the achievement of maximum employment on a sustained basis.
"Participants judged that strong aggregate demand, together with supply constraints that had been larger and longer lasting than expected, continued to contribute to price pressures across a broad array of goods and services."
 They noted that the su rge in prices of oil and other commodities associated  with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was boosting gasoline and food prices and putting additional upward pressure on inflation.
" Participants commented on the global nature of inflation pressures, and a few of them added that many foreign central banks were also firming the stance of monetary policy."
" Participants had revised up their PCE inflation projections for 2022 in their June SEP submissions, largely in response to higherthan-expected inflation readings and the slower anticipated resolution of supply constraints."
 They ex pected that the appropriate firming of monetary policy and an eventual easing of supply and demand imbalances would bring inflation back down to levels roughly consistent with the Committee’s longerrun objectives by 2024 and keep longerterm inflation expectations well anchored.
"Participants observed that some measures of inflation expectations had moved up recently, including the staff index of common inflation expectations and the expectations of inflation over the next 5 to 10 years provided in the Michigan survey."
" With respect to marketbased measures, however, a few participants noted that medium-term measures of inflation compensation fell over the intermeeting period and longerterm measures were unchanged."
" While measures of longerterm inflation expectations derived from surveys of households, professional forecasters, and market participants were generally judged to be broadly consistent with the Committee’s longerrun 2 percent inflation objective, many participants raised the concern that longerrun inflation expectations could be beginning to drift up to levels inconsistent with the 2 percent objective."
" These participants noted that, if inflation expectations were to become unanchored, it would be more costly to bring inflation back down to the Committee’s objective."
"Page 8Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ In their discussion of risks, participants emphasized that they were highly attentive to inflation risks and were closely monitoring developments regarding both inflation and inflation expectations."
" Most agreed that risks to inflation were skewed to the upside and cited several such risks, including those associated with ongoing supply bottlenecks and rising energy and commodity prices."
Participants judged that uncertainty about economic growth over the next couple of years was elevated.
" In that context, a couple of them noted that GDP and gross domestic income had been gi ving conflicting signals recently regarding the pace of economic growth, making it challenging to determine the economy’s underlying momentum."
 Most participants assessed that the risks to the outlook for economic growth were skewed to the downside.
 Downside risks includ ed the possibility that a further tightening in financial conditions would have a larger negative effect on economic activity than anticipated as well as the possibilities that the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the COVIDre lated lockdowns in China would have largerthan-expected effects on economic growth.
"In their consideration of the appropriate stance of monetary policy, participants concurred that the labor market was very tight, inflation wa s well above the Committee’s 2 percent inflation objective, and the nearterm inflation outlook had deteriorated since the time of the May meeting."
" In light of elevated inflation pressures and signs of deterioration in some measures of inflation expectations, all pa rticipants reaffirmed their strong commitment to returning inflation to the Committee’s 2 percent objective."
 Participants observed that a return of inflation to the 2 percent objective was necessary for creating conditions  conducive to a sustainably strong labor market over time.
" Participants concurred that the economic outlook warranted moving to a restrictive stance of policy, and they recogniz ed the possibility that an even more restrictive stance could be appropriate if elevated inflation pressures were to persist."
" Many participants noted that the Committee’s credibility with regard to bringing inflation back to the 2 percent objective, together with previous communications, had been helpful in shifting market ex pectations of future policy and had already contributed to a notable tightening of financial conditions that wo uld likely help reduce inflation pressures by restrainin g aggregate demand."
"At the current juncture, with inflation remaining well above the Committee’s objective, participants remarked that moving to a restrictive stance of policy was required to meet the Committee’s legislative mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability."
" In addition, such a stance would be appropriate from a risk management perspective because it would put the Committee in a better position to implement more restrictive policy if inflation came in higher than expected."
 Many participants judged that a significant risk now facing the Committee was that elevated inflation could become entrenched if the public bega n to question the resolve of the Committee to adjust the stance of policy as warranted.
" On this matter, participants stressed that appropriate firming of monetary policy, together with clear and effective communications, would be essential in restoring price stability."
"Participants remarked that developments associated with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the COVIDrelated lockdowns in China, and other factors restraining supply conditions would affect the inflation outlook and that it would likely take some time for inflation to move down to the Committee’s 2 percent objective."
 Participants also judged that maintaining a strong labor market during the process of bringing inflation down to 2 percent would depend on many factors affecting demand and supply.
"Participants recognized that policy firming could slow Minutes of the Meeting of June 14–15, 2022Page 9_____________________________________________________________________________________________ the pace of economic growth for a time, but they saw the return of inflation to 2 percent as critical to achieving maximum employment on a sustained basis."
"Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that overall economic activity appeared to have picked up after edging down in the first quarter."
"  M e m b e r s  a l s o  agreed that inflation remained elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher energy prices, and broader price pressures."
 Members agreed that the invasion and related events were creating additional upward pressure on inflation and were weighing on global economic activity.
" In light of these developments, members remarked that they remain highly attentive to the upside risks to inflation and would be nimble in responding to incoming data and the evolving outlook."
"In their assessment of the monetary policy stance necessary for achieving the Committee’s maximumemploy-ment and pricestability goals,  the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 1½ to 1¾ percent and anticipated that ongoing increases in the target range would be appropriate."
"Members judged that, with high and widespread inflation pressures and some measures of longerterm inflation expectations moving up somewhat, it would be appropriate for the postmeeting statement to note that the Committee was strongly commi tted to returning inflation to its 2 percent objective."
" As the further firming in the policy stance would likely result in some slowing in economic growth and tempering in labor market conditions, members also agreed to remove the previous statement language that had indicated an expectation that appropriate policy would result in a return of inflation to 2 percent and a strong labor market."
"Members agreed that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and that they would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate in the event that risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals."
" They also concurred that their assessments would take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments."
