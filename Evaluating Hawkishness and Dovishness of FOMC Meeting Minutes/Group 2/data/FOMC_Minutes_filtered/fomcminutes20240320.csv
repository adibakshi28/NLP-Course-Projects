" At shorter maturities, most of the increase was attributable to a rise in inflation compensation, prompted by indications that the decline in inflation wa s proceeding somewhat more slowly than markets in recent months had been expecting."
" In contrast, at longer maturities, much of the increase in Treasury yields was due to a rise in real rates, reflecting solid labor market readings and strongerthan-expected data on economic activity."
" The changes in policy rate expectations over the intermeeting period occurred in the wake of stronger economic data, perceptions that disinflation might be proceeding more slowly than previously thought, and Federal Reserve communications."
" This growth was again driven primarily by the strong increases in valuations of largecapitalization technology companies, while broader equity price gains were more measured."
" At the end of the intermeeting period, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) announced that it would discontinue its policies of a negative shortterm interest rate and yield curve control; this decision was largely expected by investors, and the BOJ’s anno uncement had a limited effect on global financial markets."
" The manager noted that there was nevertheless significant uncertainty about the demand for reserves and that, under the current pace of runoff of the Federal Reserve’s securities portfolio, stabilization in total ON RRP balances would, all else equal, cause reserves to start declining at a rapid rate."
" All part icipants emphasized the importance of communicating that a decision to slow the pace of runoff would have no  implications for the stance of monetary policy, as it would mean implementing one of the transitional steps previously announced in the Committee’s balance sheet plans."
" Consumer price inflation—as measured by the 12month change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE)—continued to tren ddown, though it remained above 2 percent.Labor demand and supply appeared to continue to move into better balance, althou gh recent indicators were mixed."
 Total nonfarm payroll employment increased at a faster average monthly pace over January and February than in the fourth quarter.
" In contrast, the unemployment rate edged up to 3.9 pe rcent in February, while the labor force participation rate and the employmentto-population ratio were essentially unchanged."
" The unemployment rate for African Americans increased, and the rate for Hispanics was unch anged; both rates were higher than those for Asians and for Whites."
 The Wage Growth Tracker constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta was lower over the past two months than readings last year.
"Consumer price inflation continued to decline, but recent progress was uneven."
" Total PCE prices increased 2.5 percent over the 12 months ending in January, while core PCE price inflation—which excludes changes in energy prices and many consumer food prices—was 2.9 percent over the same period."
" The trimmed mean measure of 12mo nth PCE priceinflation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank ofDallas was 3.2 percent in Janu ary, lower than its level ayear earlier."
" Recent survey measures of consumers’ inflation expectations at both shorterand longerterm horizons werebroadly in line with the levels seen in the decade beforethe pandemic.Recent indicators suggested that real GDP was increasing at a solid pace in the first quarter, although more slowly than its robust fourthquarter rate."
" Incoming data pointed to some slowing in PCE growth, as expenditures declined in January and the components of the retail sales data used to estimate PCE were soft in February."
" In contrast, starts and permits for singlefamily homes in January and February pointed to a modest pickup in residential investment growth."
 Real exports of goods stepped down in January relative to December following rapid growth last quarter.
" Overall, the nominal U.S. international trade deficit widened in January, as goods and services imports expanded more than exports, which increased only slightly."
" G D P  g r o w t h  i n  t h e  f o u r t h  quarter, economic growth in foreign economies was generally weak amid tight monetary policy, the erosion in real household incomes from high inflation, and the Minutes of the Meeting of March 19–20, 2024Page 5_____________________________________________________________________________________________ongoing repercussions of th e 2022 energy shock in Europe."
" More recently, purchasing managers indexes in Europe through February and other indicators provided tentative signs of some firming in the region’s economic activity."
" Although exports, investment, and industrial production were strong, household demand remained depresse d amid China’s ongoing propertysector slump."
" On the other hand, some economies in emerging Asia performed well, in part reflecting strong demand for leadin gedge semiconductors."
Foreign headline inflation picked up early in the year as the downward pressure from previous energy price declines waned and some emerging market economies (EMEs) experienced renewed food price pressures due to adverse weather.
 Most major foreign central banks kept their policy rates unchanged over the intermeeting period and emphasized the need for greater confidence that inflation was falling back to target before easing policy.
 Most of the increase in shortterm Treasury yields was attributed to a rise in nearterm inflation compensation.
" Marketbased measures of nearterm interest rate uncertainty for shorterterm yields remained elevated by historical standards, in part reflecting investors’ continued uncertainty about the path of policy rates."
"Despite the rise in interest rates, broad stock price indexes increased notably amid upbeat corporate earnings reports, particularly for the largest firms."
" At its meeting on March 19, the BOJ exited negative interest rate policy and increased its overnight policy rate from negative 0.1 percent to a range of 0 to 0.1 percent."

 Growth in auto lending at finance companies was muted in January following robust growth last year.
" CRE loans at banks picked up moderately in January and February, driven by growth in multifamily and residential loans."
" The lagged effects of earlier monetary policy actions, through their continued contribution to tight financial and credit conditions, were still expected to hold output growth in 2024 below the staff’s estimate of potential growth."
 The unemployment rate was forecast to remain roughly flat over the next several years.
"Total and core PCE price inflation were both projected to edge down in 2024, ending the year around 2½ percent, as demand and supply in product and labor markets continued to move into  better balance."
" By 2026, total and core PCE price inflation were expected to be close to 2 percent."
" Risks around the inflation forecast were seen as tilted slightly to the upside, as supplyside disruptions—from developm ents domestically or abroad—or unexpectedly persistent inflation dynamics could materialize."
" The risks around the forecast for economic activity were viewed as skewed a little to the downside, as any substantial setback in reducing inflation might lead to a tightening of financial conditions that would slow the pace of economic activity by more than the staff anticipated in their baseline forecast."
"  Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2024 through 2026 and over the longer run."
" The projections were based on their individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy, including the path of the federal funds rate."
" The longerrun projections represented each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to conv erge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy."
" In their discussion of inflation, participants observed that significant progress had been made over the past Minutes of the Meeting of March 19–20, 2024Page 7_____________________________________________________________________________________________year to ward the Committee’s 2 percent inflation objective even though the two most recent monthly readings on core and headline inflation had been firmer than expected."
 Some participants noted that the recent increases in inflation had been relatively broad based and therefore should not be discounted as merely statistical aberrations.
" However, a few participants noted that residual seasonality could have affected the inflation readings at the start of the year."
 Participants generally commented that they remained highly attentive to inflation risks but that they had also anticipated that there would be some unevenness in monthl y inflation readings as inflation returned to target.
"In their outlook for inflation, participants noted that they continued to expect that inflation would return to 2 percent over the medium term."
" They remained concerned that elevated inflation continued to harm households, especially those least ab le to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation."
 A few participants remarked that they expected core nonhousing services inflation to decline as the labor market continued to move into bett er balance and wage growth moderated further.
 Particip ants discussed the stillelevated rate of housing services inflation and commented on the uncertainty regarding when and by how much lower readings for rent growth on new leases would pass through to this category of inflation.
 Several participants noted that the disinflationary pressure for core goods that had resulted from the receding of supply chain bottlenecks was likely to moderate.
" Other factors related to aggregate supply, such as increases in the labor force or better productivity growth, were viewed by several participants as likely to support continued disinflation."
" Some participants observed that longerterm inflation expectations appeared to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets."
  Participants expected that economic growth would slow from last year’s strong pace.
"Participants noted mixed reports about the pace of homebuilding amid stillelevated financing costs for developers, despite strong housing demand and a limited supply of affordable housing."
" Some participants noted that increased immigration, which had likely been boosting the growth of personal consumption spending, may also have been adding to the demand for housing."
"Reports from business contacts in some industries and Districts conveyed increased optimism about the outlook, while contacts in a couple of other Districts reported only a steady or stable pace of economic activity."
" Participants noted strong recent payroll growth, while the unemployment rate remained low."
 Several participants noted that the better balance between labor supply and demand had contributed to an easing of nominal wage pressures.
 Part icipants further commented that recent estimates of greater immigration in the past few years and an overall increase in labor supply could help explain the strength in employment gains even as Page 8Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________the une mployment rate had remained roughly flat and wage pressures had eased.
 Participants generally noted their uncertainty about the persistence of high inflation and expressed the view that recent data had not increased their confidence that inflation was moving sustainably down to 2 percent.
" Some participants pointed to geopolitical risks that might result in mo re severe supply bottlenecks or higher shipping costs that could put upward pressure on prices, and observed that those developments could also weigh on economic growth."
 The possibility that geopolitical events or surges in domestic demand could generate increased energy prices was also seen as an upside risk to inflation.
" Some participants noted the uncertainties regarding the restrictiveness of financial conditions and the associated risk that conditions were or could become less restrictive than desired, which could add momentum to aggregate demand and put upward pressure on inflation."
" Several participants commented that increased efficiencies and technological innovations had the potential to raise productivity growth, which might allow the economy to grow faster without raising inflation."
" Participants also noted downside risks to economic activity, including slowing economic growth in China, a deterioration in conditions in domestic CRE markets, a potential reemergence of stresses in the banking sector, or the possibility that a pickup in layoffs could result in a relatively rapid rise in unemployment."
" Many participants pointed to the difficulty in assessing how recent immigration trends would influence the evolution of labor supply, aggregate demand, and overall economic activity."
"  In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, all participants judged that, in light of current economic conditions, the outlook for economic activity and inflation, and the balance of risks, it was appropriate to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5¼ to 5½ percent."
 Participants commented that maintaining the current target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting would support the Committee’s progress to return inflation to the 2 percent objective and keep longerterm inflation expectations well anchored.
" In support of this view, they noted that the disinflation process was continuing along a path that was generally expected to be somewhat uneven."
 They also pointed to the Committee’s policy actions together with the ongoing improvements in supply conditions as factors working to move supply and demand into better balance.
 Participants noted indicators pointing to strong economic momentum and disappointing readings on inflation in recent months and commented that they did not expect it would be appropriate to reduce the target range for the federal funds rate until they had gained greater confidence that inflation was moving sustainably toward 2 percent.
 Participants noted the importance of continuing to communicate clearly the Committee’s datadependent approach in formulating monetary policy and the strong commitment to achieve its dualmandate objectives of maximum employment and price stability.
" In discussing riskmanagement considerations that could bear on the policy outlook, participants generally judged that risks to the achievement of the Committee’s employment and inflation goals were moving into better balance."
" They remarked th at it was important to weigh the risks of maintaining a rest rictive stance for too long, which could unduly weaken economic activity and employment, against the risks of easing policy too quickly, which could stall or even reverse progress in returning inflation to the Committee’ s 2 percent inflation objective."
" Regarding the latter risk, participants emphasized the importance of carefully assessing incoming data to judge whether inflation is moving down sustainably to 2 percent."
" Participants no ted various sources of uncertainty associated with their outlooks for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, with some participants additionally mentioning uncertainty about the extent to which past monetary policy actions or the current stance of policy would weigh further on aggregate demand."
" Participants agreed, however, that monetary policy remained well positioned to respond to evolving economic conditions and risks to the outlook, including the possibility of maintaining the current restrictive policy stance for longer should the disinflation process slow, or reducing policy restraint in the event of an unexpected weakening in labor market conditions."
