"Logan, Vice Presidents, Federal Reserve Banks of Richmond and New York, respectively   Monetary Policy under Alternative Scenarios  A staff presentation provided an overview of an exercise that explored individual participants’ views on appropriate monetary policy responses under alternative economic scenarios."
 Commit tee participants discussed the potential value and drawbacks of this type of exercise for both internal deliberations and external communications about monetary policy.
 Possible benefits include helping to clarify the factors that individual participants judge most important in forming their views about the economic outlook and their assessments of appropriate monetary policy.
" Payroll employment continued to move up, and the unemployment rate, while still elevated, declined a little further."
" Overall consumer price inflation increased somewhat, primarily reflecting higher prices of crude oil and gasoline, but measures of longrun inflation expectations  remained stable."
The unemployment rate declined to 8.2 percent in March.
" The share of workers employed part time for economic reasons also moved down, but the rate of longduration unemployment remained elevated."
" Private nonfarm employment rose at a slower pace in March than in the preceding three months, while total government employment was little changed in recent months after declining last year."
The U.S. international trade deficit narrowed in February as exports rose and impo rts fell.
" Nearterm inflation expectations from the Thomson Reut ers/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers increased in March but then fell back in early April, wh ile longerterm inflation expectations in the survey remained stable."
"Recent indicators suggested that foreign economic activity improved on balance in the first quarter, but there were important differences across economies."
" Readings on foreign inflation eased, although they were still relatively high in some Latin American countries."
" However, asset prices fluctuated subs tantially over the period, apparently in response to the evolving views on the U.S. and global economic ou tlook and changing expectations regarding the future course of monetary policy."
 Domestic nonfinancial firms’ bond issuance and growth in commercial and industrial (C&I) loans were robust in the first quarter.
" Leveraged loan issuance was brisk over this period as well, reportedly supported by investor demand for newly issued collateralized loan obligations as well as by interest from pension funds and other institutional investors."
" The Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices conducted in April indicated that, in the aggregate, domestic banks eased slightly their lending standards on core loans—C&I, real estate, and consumer loans—and experienced somewhat stronger demand for such loans in the first quarter of 2012."
" C&I loans at domestic banks continued to expand in March, with growth concentrated at large domestic banks."
"M2 expanded at a moderate pace in March, reflecting growth in liquid deposits an d currency that was only partially offset by declines in small time deposits and in balances in retail mo ney market funds."
 Monetary policy abroad remained generally accommodative.
"The total outstanding amount on the Federal Reserve’s dollar liquidity swap lines declined to $32 billion, down from $65 billion at the time of the March FOMC meeting; demand for dollars fell at the lending operations of the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan, and the Swiss National Bank."
"  Staff Economic Outlook  In the economic forecast prepared for the April FOMC meeting, the staff revised up slightly its nearterm projection for real gross domestic product (GDP) growth, reflecting that the unemployment rate was a little lower, the level of overall payroll employment a bit higher, and consumer spending noticeably stronger than the staff had expected at the time of the previous forecast."
" However, the staff’s mediumterm projection for real GDP growth in the April forecast was little changed from the one presented in March."
" The staff continued to project that real GDP would accelerate gradually through 2014, supported by accommodative monetary policy, further improvements in credit availability, and rising consumer and business sentiment."
" Increases in economic activity were expect ed to be sufficient to decrease the wide margin of slack in the labor market slowly over the projection period, but the unemployment rate was anticipated to still be elevated at the end of 2014."
"The staff’s forecast for inflation over the projection period was just a bit above the forecast prepared for the March FOMC meeting, reflecting somewhat higher-thanexpected data on core consumer prices and a slightly narrower margin of economic slack than in the March forecast."
" However, with the passthrough of the recent runup in crude oil prices into consumer energy prices seen as nearly complete, oil prices expected to edge lower from current levels, substantial resource slack persisting over the projection period, and stable longrun inflation expectations, the staff continued to forecast that inflation woul d be subdued through 2014."
"Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, meeting participants—the five members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks, all of whom participate in the deliberations of the FOMC—submitted their assessments of real output growth, the unemployment rate, inflation, and the target federal funds rate for each year from 2012 through 2014 and over the longer run, under each participant’s judgment of appropriate monetary policy."
" The longerrun projections re present each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy."
" So far this year, payroll employment had expanded at a faster pace than last year and the unemployment rate had declined further, although it remained elevated."
" Despite some volatility in financial markets over the intermeeting period, financial conditions in U.S. markets continued to improve; bank credit quality and loan demand  both increased."
" However, longerterm inflation expectations remained stable."
"Participants’ assessments of the economic outlook were little changed, with the intermeeting information generally seen as suggesting that economic growth would remain moderate over coming quarters and then pick up gradually."
" Reflecting the moderate pace of economic growth, most anticipated a gradual decline in the unemployment rate."
" A number of factors continued to be seen as likely limiting the  economic expansion to a moderate pace in the near term; these included slow growth in some foreign economies, prospective fiscal tightening in the United States, slow household income growth, and—notwithstanding some recent signs of improvement—ongoing weakness in the housing market."
" Most participants anticipated that inflation would fall back from recent elevated levels as the effects of higher energy prices waned, and still expected that inflation subsequently would run at or below the   2 percent rate that the Committee judges to be most consistent with its statutory mandate."
" However, other participants saw upside risks to the inflation outlook given the recent pickup in inflation and the highly accommodative stance of monetary policy."
 The recent strengthening in the pace of light motor vehicle sales was attributed to both pentup demand and the desire for increased fuel efficiency in the wake of higher gasoline prices.
" Looking forward, increases in household wealth  f r o m  t h e  r i s e  i n  e q u i t y  prices, improving consumer sentiment, and a diminishing drag from household deleveraging were seen as helping to support continued increases in household expenditures, notwithstanding sluggish growth in real disposable income and restrictive fiscal policies."
" Most participants anticipated that the housing sector was likely to recover only slowly over time, but a few were more optimistic about the potential for a more rapid housing recovery given reports of stronger demand in some regions and of improved sentiment among builders, as well as signs that recent changes to the Home Affordable Refinance Program were contributing to the refinancing of performing high loanto-value mortgages."
 Auto production had picked up in light of strengthening demand.
" Business contacts suggested  that sentiment was improving, but many firms remained somewhat cautious in their hiring and investment decisions, with most capital investment being undertaken to improve productivity or gain market share rather than to expand capacity."
Participants expected that the government sector would be a drag on economic growth over coming quarters.
"Exports have supported U.S. growth so far this year; however, some participants noted risks to the export picture from economic weakness in Europe or from a more significant slowdown in the pace of expansion in China and emerging Asia."
" The decline in labor force participation, which has been sharpest for younger workers, has been a factor in the nearly 1 percentage point decline in the unemployment rate since last August, a drop that was larger than would have been predicted from the historical relationship between real GDP growth and changes in the unemployment rate."
" Assessing the extent to wh ich the changes in labor force participation reflect cyclical factors that will be reversed once the recovery picks up, as opposed to changes in the trend rate of participation, was seen as important for understanding unemployment dynamics going forward."
" One participant cited research suggesting that about half of the d ecline in labor force participation had reflected cyclical factors, and thus, as participation picks up, unemployment may decline more slowly in coming quarters compared with the recent pace."
 Another posited that the strength in payroll job growth in recent months may be a onetime reaction to the sharp layoffs in 2008 and 2009 and that future job gains may be somewhat weaker unless the pace of economic growth increases.
 Participants expressed a range Page 6Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________of views on the extent to which the unemployment rate was being boosted by structural factors such as mismatches between the skills of unemployed workers and those being demanded by hiring firms.
" A few participants acknowledged there could be structural factors at work, but said that in their view, slack remained high and weak aggregate demand was the major reason that unemployment was still elev ated."
" Two noted the possibility that sustained high levels of longterm unemployment could result in higher structural unemployment, an outcome that might be forestalled by increased aggregate demand."
  A few participants noted that current measures of labor market slack would be overstated if structural factors accounted for a large portion of the current high levels of unemployment.
" As a result, such measures might be an unreliable guide as to how close the economy was to maximum employment."
" So me participants cited the recent rise in inflation, abstracting from the direct effect of the rise in energy prices, as supportive of the view that the level of slack was lower than some believe."
" Bank credit quality and consumer and business loan demand were increasing, although commercial and residential real estate lending remained relatively weak."
 A few participants indicated that they were seeing signs that very low interest rates might be inducing some investors to take on im prudent risks in the search for higher nominal returns.
Readings on consumer price inflation had picked up somewhat mainly because of increases in oil and gasoline prices earlier in the year.
" With longerrun inflation expectations well anchored and the unemployment rate elevated, most participants anticipated that after the temporary effect of the rise in oil and gasoline prices had run its course, inflation would be at or below the 2 percent rate that the Committee judges to be most consistent with its mandate."
" Overall, most participants viewed the risks to their inflation outlook as being roughly balanced."
" However, some participants saw a risk that inflation pressures could increase as the expansion continued; they pointed to the fact that inflation was currently above target and were skeptical of models that rely on economic slack to forecast inflation partly because of the difficulty in measuring slack, especially in real time."
 These participants were concerned that maintaining the current highly accommodative stance of monetary policy over the medium run could erode the stability of inflation expectations and risk higher inflation.
"In their discussion of the economic outlook and policy, some participants noted the potential usefulness of simple monetary policy rules, of the type the Committee regularly reviews, as guides for monetary policy decisionmaking and for external communications about policy."
 These participants suggested that because such rules give an indication of how policy should systematically respond to changes in economic conditions they might help clarify the relationship between appropriate monetary policy and the evolution of the economic outlook.
" While acknowledging that there could be differences across participants in the type of rules they might favor—for example, one participant expressed a preference for rules based on growth rates rather than output gaps because of measurement issues—a few participants indicated that the likely degree of commonality across participants was suggestive that this might be a promising approach to explore."
" Another participant questioned the value of inte rest rate rules when the policy rate is constrained by the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates and unconventional policy options are being used, but others indicated they believed the rules could be appropriately adjusted to account for these factors."
" Participants planned to discuss further, at a future meeting, the potential merits and drawbacks of using simple rules as guides to monetary policy decisionmaking and for communications."
Committee Policy Action Members viewed the information on U.S. economic activity received over the intermeeting period as suggesting that the economy had been expanding moderately and generally agreed that the economic outlook was broadly similar to that at the time of their March meeting.
" Labor market conditions had improved in recent months, and the unemployment rate had fallen, but almost all of the members saw the unemployment rate as still elevated relative to levels that they viewed as consistent with the Committee’s mandate."
 Growth was expected to be moderate over coming quarters and then to pick up over time.
 Members expected the unemployment rate to decline gradually.
 Strains in global financial markets stemming from the sovereign debt and banking situation in Europe continued to pose significant downside risks to economic activity both here and abroad.
" Recent readings indicated that inflation remained above the Committee’s 2 percent longerrun target, primarily reflecting the increase in o il and gasoline prices seen earlier in the year."
" With longerterm inflation expectations stable, most members anticipated that the increase in inflation would prove temporary and that subsequently inflation would run at or below the rate that the Committee judges to be most consistent with its mandate."
" However, one member thought that there were upside risks to inflation, especially if the current degree of highly accommodative monetary policy were maintained much beyond this year."
"In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, the Committee members reached the collective judgment that it would be appropriate to maintain the existing highly accommodative stance of monetary policy."
" With the economic outlook over the medium term not greatly changed, almost all of the members again agreed to indicate that the Committee expects to maintain a highly accommodative stance for monetary policy and currently anticipates that economic conditions—including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run—are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through late 2014."
" Most me mbers continued to anticipate that the unemployment rate would still be well above their estimates of its longerrun level, and inflation would be at or below the Committee’s longerrun objective, in late 2014."
" Some Committee members indicated that their policy judgment reflected in part their perception of downside risks to growth, especially since the Committee’s ability to respond to weakerthan-expected economic cond itions would be somewhat limited by the constraint imposed on monetary policy when the policy rate is near the zero lower bound."
 Several members indicated that additional monetary policy accommodation could be necessary if the economic recovery lost momentum or the downside risks to the fore cast became great enough.
Committee members discusse d the desirability of providing more clarity about the economic conditions that would likely warrant maintaining the current target range for the federal funds rate and those that would indicate that a change in monetary policy was appropriate.
 The Chairman asked the subcommittee on communications to consider possible enhancements and refinements to the SEP that might help better clarify the link between economic developments and the Committee’s view of the appropriate stance of monetary policy.
"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct  the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was in structed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: “The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output."
 The System Open Market Account Manager and the Secretary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the System’s balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the Committee’s objectives of maximum employment and price stability.” The vote encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 12:30 p.m.: “Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in March suggests that the economy has been expanding moderately.
 Labor market conditions have improved in recent months; the unemployment rate has declined but remains elevated.
" Inflation has picked up somewhat, mainly reflecting higher prices of crude oil and gasoline."
" However, longerterm inflation expectations have remained stable."
"Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
" The Committee expects economic growth to remain modMinutes of the Meeting of April 24–25, 2012Page 9_____________________________________________________________________________________________erate over coming quarters then to pick up gradually."
" Consequently, the Committee anticipates that the unemployment rate will decline gradually toward levels that it judges to be consistent with its dual mandate."
" The increase in oil and gasoline prices earlier this year is expected to affect inflation only temporarily, and the Committee anticipates that subs equently inflation will run at or below the rate that it judges most consistent with its dual mandate."
"To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate, the Committee expects to maintain a highly accommodative stance for monetary policy."
" In particular, the Committee decided today to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and currently anticipates that economic conditions—including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run—are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through late 2014."
" In his view, an increase  in the federal funds rate was likely to be necessary by mid2013 to prevent the emergence of inflationary pressures."
"English Secretary Page 10Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________Summary of Economic Projections In conjunction with the April 24–25, 2012, Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, meeting participants—the members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks, all of whom participate in the deliberations of the FOMC— submitted their assessments of real output growth, the unemployment rate, inflation, and the target federal funds rate for each year from 2012 through 2014 and over the longer run, under each participant’s judgment of appropriate monetary policy."
" The longer-run projections represen t each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy."
 “Appropriate monetary policy” is defined as the future path of policy that participants deem most likely to foster outcomes for economic activity and inflation that best satisfy their individual interpretations of the Federal Reserve’s objectives of maximum employment and stable prices.
"Overall, the assessments that FOMC participants submitted in April indicated that, with appropriate monetary policy, the pace of economic recovery over the 2012–14 period would likely cont inue to be moderate."
" Taki ng into account the decline in the unemployment rate since the time of the previous Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) in January, participants generally anticipated only a small further reduction in the unemployment rate this year."
 They judged that the unemployment rate would then gradually move lower as eco nomic growth picks up.
" Even so, participants generally projected that the unemployment rate at the end of 2014 would still be well above their estimates of the longerrun rate of unemployment that they currently view as being consistent with the FOMC’s statutory mandate for promoting maximum employment and pri ce stability."
" Most participants judged that inflation, as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), would be at or below the FOMC’s longrun inflation objective of 2 percent under the assumption of appropriate monetary policy."
 Core inflation was generally projected to run at rates similar to those of overall inflation.
"Relative to their previous projections in January, shown in table 1, participants revised up their projected rate of increase in real GDP in 2012 while marking down the pace of real growth over the next two years."

"Page 2Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________by more than participants had anticipated in the previous SEP, they generally lowered their projections for the level of the unemployment rate over coming years."
 Participants’ expectations for both the longerrun rate of increase in real GDP and the longerrun unemployment rate were little changed from January.
 The range and central tendency of the projections of longerrun inflation remained equal to 2 percent.
"As shown in figure 2, most participants judged that highly accommodative monetary policy was likely to be warranted over coming years to promote a stronger economic recovery in the cont ext of price stability."
" In particular, with inflation generally projected to be subdued over the projection period and the unemployment rate elevated, 11 participants thought that it would be appropriate for the first increase in the target federal funds rate to occur during 2014 or later, the same number as in the January SEP (upper panel)."
 The remaining 6 participants judged that it would be appropriate to raise the federal funds rate in 2012 or 2013 in order to avoid a buildup of inflationary pressures or the creation of imbalances in the financial system.
 One participant reported that appropriate policy would include additional balance sheet actions in the near term to  mitigate downside risks to economic growth.
"Most participants judged the level of uncertainty associated with their projections for real activity, the unemployment rate, and inflation to be unusually high relative to historical norms, although the number of participants doing so declined somewhat since the January SEP."
" About half of the participants now see the risks to real GDP growth as weighted to the downside and those to the unemployment rate as weighted to the upside, also down somewhat from the previous SEP."
" As in January, a majority of participants viewed the risks to their inflation projections as broadly balanced."
"The Outlook for Economic Activity Under appropriate monetary policy, participants continued to judge that the economy would expand at a moderate pace over the projection period."
" The central tendency of participants’ projections for the change in real GDP growth in 2012 was 2.4 to 2.9 percent, a bit higher than in January."
 Growth at this rate would be a noticeable pickup from the pace of expansion in 2011 and a little above most participants’ assessments of trend growth over the longer run.
 Participants projected that real GDP growth would pick up gradually over the 2013–14 period.
" Economic growth would be supported by monetary policy accommodation as well as some gradual improvements in credit conditions, the housing sector, and household balance sheets."
" The central tendencies of participants’ projections of real growth in 2013 and 2014 were 2.7 to 3.1 percent and 3.1 to 3.6 percent, respectively, down somewhat from the central tendencies of the January projections."
" In particular, tighter fiscal policy seemed likely to impart a si gnificant drag on economic activity for a time."
"Overview of FOMC participants’ assessments of appropriate monetary policy, April 2012                    Appropriate timing of policy f irming                    Number of p articipants            Appropriate pace of policy f irming                          Percent           NOTE:  In the upper panel, the height of each bar denotes the number of FOMC participants who judge that, under appropriate monetary policy, the first increase in the target federal funds rate from its current ran ge of 0 to ¼ percent will occur in the specified calendar year."
 Most participants marked down their projections for the rate of unemployment over the projection period.
" The unemployment rate had d eclined from 8.7 percent, on average, in the final quarter of last year to 8.2 percent at the end of the first quarter of 2012, more than most participants anticipated when they prepared their January projections."
" With real GDP expected to increase at a moderate pace, the unemployment rate was projected to decline only a bi t further this year, with the central tendency of participants’ forecasts at 7.8 to    8.0 percent at yearend."
 The central tendency of participants’ forecasts for the unemployment rate was 7.3 to 7.7 percent at the end of 2013 and 6.7 to   7.4 percent at the end of 2014.
" The central tendency of participants’ estimates of the longerrun normal rate of unemployment that would prevail in the absence of further shocks to the economy was 5.2 to 6.0 percent, unchanged from January."
" Most participants anticipated that five or six years would be required to close the gap between the current unemployment rate and their estimates of the longerrun rate, although a few anticipated that less time would be needed."
"The diversity of participants’ projections for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate over the next three years and over the longer run is depicted in figures 3.A and 3.B.  The dispersion in these projections reflects differences in participants ’ assessments of many factors, including appropriate monetary policy and its effects on the economy, the underlying momentum in economic activity, the likely evolution of credit and financial market conditions, the prospective path for U.S. fiscal policy, the effects of the European situation, and the extent to which current dislocations in the labor market were structural versus cyclical."
" Given the decline in the rate of unemployment in the first quarter, the distribution of participants’ projections of this variable for the fourth quarter  of 2012 shifted noticeably lower, and the range of these projections became considerably narrower, relative to the January assessments."
 The distributions of the unemployment rate projections for 2013 and 2014 exhibited less pronounced shifts toward lower rates.
" Participants made only minor adjustments to their projections of the rates of output growth and unemployment over the longer run, leaving the dispersions of their projections for both little changed."
" As in January, the dispersion of estimates for the longerrun rate of output growth is fairly narrow, with only one participant’s estimate outside of a range of 2.2 to 2.7 percent."
" By comparison, participants’ views about the level to which the unemployment rate would converge in the longer run are more diverse, reflecting, among other things, different views on the outlook for labor supply and the structure of the labor market."
The Outlook for Inflation Participants’ views about the outlook for inflation generally firmed a little since January.
" In particular, a majority of participants indicated that the incoming readings on inflation, especially for the prices of crude oil and gasoline, were a little hi gher than had been anticipated."
" Nonetheless, assumi ng no further shocks, most participants judged that both headline and core inflation would remain subdued over the 2012–14 period, running at rates at or below the FOMC’s longerrun objective of 2 percent under the assumption of appropriate monetary policy."
" Part icipants pointed to several factors that would help restrain inflation pressures over the projection period, including expected declines in commodity prices, modest in creases in business costs, and the ongoing stability of inflation expectations."
" Specifically, the central tendency of participants’ projections for inflation, as measured by the PCE price index, moved up in 2012 to 1.9 to 2."
"0 percent, and it edged up in 2013 and 2014 to 1.6 to 2.0 percent and 1.7 to       2.0 percent, respectively; the central tendencies of the forecasts for core PCE inflation were very close to those for the total measure."
" Participants indicated that it would take about five or six years, or less, for inflation to converge to its longerrun level."
" Information about the diversity of participants’ views regarding the outlook for inflation is provided in figures 3.C and 3.D.  Relative to the assessments that were compiled in January and reflecting the recent incoming data, the projections for inflation shifted higher in 2012 and exhibited a noticeably narrower range."
" The dispersion of inflation projecti ons also narrowed in 2013, although to a lesser degree, and was little changed in 2014."
" In general, the dispersion of views on the outlook for inflation over the projection period represented differences in judgments regarding a range of issues, including the current degree of slack in resource utilization and the extent to which such slack influences inflation and inflation expectations."
" In addition, participants differed in their estimates of how the stance of monetary policy would influence inflation expectations."

"Summary of Economic Projections of the Meeting of April 24–25, 2012Page 9_____________________________________________________________________________________________Appropriate Monetary Policy About half of the participants judged that exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate would remain appropriate at least until late  2014."
" Participants’ estimates of the longerrun target federal funds rate ranged from 3½ to 4½ percent, reflecting the Committee’s inflation objective of 2 percent and participants’ individual judgments about the longerrun equilibr ium level of the real federal funds rate."
"Several key factors informed participants’ individual expectations about the appropriate setting for monetary policy, including their assessments of the maximum level of employment, the Committee’s longerrun inflation objective, the extent to which current conditions had deviated from these mandateconsistent levels and why the deviations had arisen, and their projections of the likely time periods required to return employment and inflation to  levels they judge to be most consistent with the Committee’s mandate."
" Several participants commented that their assessments took into account the risks and uncertainties associated with their outlooks for economic activity and inflation, and one pointed specifically to the potential effects of a protracted period of very low interest rates on financial stability."
" Participants also noted that because the appropriate stance of monetary policy depends importantly on the evolution of real activity and inflation over time, their assessments of the appropriate future path of the federal funds rate would change if economic conditions were to evolve in an unexpected manner."
" Two participants judged that once begun, asset sales should proceed relatively quickly, while one participan t’s assessment of appropriate monetary policy incorporated an expansion of the maturity extension program in the near term."
" Relative to the other participants, the group of participants who judged that a longer period of exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate would be appropriate tended to include those who anticipated a somewhat more gradual increase in the pace of the economic expansion and a slower decline in the unemployment rate over the projection period."
" In contrast, the six participants who judged that policy firming should begin in 2012 or 2013 included some who projected a somewhat faster pickup in economic activity over the near term."
" Participants seeing an earlier increase in the target federal funds rate tended to indicate that the Committee would need to begin removing policy accommodation relatively soon in order to keep inflation at mandateconsistent levels and to limit the risk of undermining the Federal Reserve’s credibility and causPage 10Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________24681012141618Number of participantsFigure 3.E.

 One of these participants also stressed the risk of distortions in the financial system from an extended period of exceptionally low interest rates.
"Uncertainty and Risks Most participants judged that their projections for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate were subject to a higher level of uncertainty than was the norm during the previous 20 years (figure 4).1  However, the number reporting elevated uncertainty moved down somewhat relative to the January SEP."
" Many participants also judged the levels of uncertainty associated with their inflation forecasts to be higher than the longerrun historical norm, but such an assessment continued to be somewhat less prevalent among participants than was the case for uncertainty about real activity."
 Many participants also cited considerable uncertainty about U.S. fiscal policy over coming quarters and its potential implications for economic activity.
 Among the sources of uncertainty about the outlook for inflation were the difficulties in assessing the current and prospective margins of slack in resource markets and the effect of such slack on prices.
" Participants also cited uncertainty about the future path of global commodity prices, which were seen as depending on idiosy ncratic supply and demand factors as well as on global growth."
"                                                 1 Table 2 provides estimates of the forecast uncertainty for the change in real GDP, the unemployment rate, and total consumer price inflation over the period from 1992 to 2011."
"Turning to the balance of risks that participants attached to their economic projections, about half reported that they judged the risks to their forecasts of both real GDP growth and the unemployment rate as broadly balanced, a few more than was the case in January."
 Nearly all of the remaining participants viewed the risks to real GDP growth as weighted to the downside and the risks to the unemployment rate as skewed to the upside.
" In addition, some of the factors that had restrained the U.S. reco very in recent years could persist for longer than currently expected and thus weigh on economic activity to a greater extent going forward than participants had assumed in their baseline forecasts."
" A few pa rticipants noted the risk of another disruption in global oil markets or greater tensions in the Middle East that could not only boost inflation but also reduce real incomes, consumer confidence, and spending."

" As described in the box “Forecast Unce rtainty,” under certain assumptions, there is about a 70 percent probabili ty that actual outcomes for real GDP, unemployment, and consumer prices will be in ranges implied by the average size of projection errors  made in the past."

"Most participants judged the risks to their projections of inflation as broadly balanced, including a few more than held that view in Janu ary."
" However, a few saw the risks as tilted to the upsi de, pointing to the possibility of disruptions in global oil and commodity markets or to effects from the current stance of monetary policy."
" Two of these participants indicated that the current highly accommodative stance of monetary policy and the substantial liquidity currently in the financial system risked a pickup in inflation to a level above the Committee’s longerrun objective, or cited the risk that uncertainty about the Committ ee’s ability to effectively remove policy accommodation when appropriate could lead to a rise in inflation expectations."
  Page 14Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________       Forecast Uncertainty    The economic projections provided by the members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks inform discussions of monetary policy among policymakers and can aid public understanding of the basis for policy actions.
" Thus, in setting the stance of monetary policy, participants consider no t only what appears to be the most likely economic outcome as embodied in their projections, but also the range of alternative possibilities, the likelihood of their occurring, and the potential costs to the economy should they occur."
"Table 2 summarizes the average historical accuracy of a range of forecasts, including those reported in past Monetary Policy Report s and those prepared by the Federal Reserve Board’s staff in advance of meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee."
 The corresponding 70 percent confidence intervals for overall inflation would be 1.2 to 2.8 percent in the current year and 1.0 to 3.0 percent in the second and third years.
"As with real activity and inflation, the outlook for the future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable uncertainty."
 This uncertainty arises primarily because each participant’s assessment of the appropriate stance of monetary policy depends importantly on the evolution of real activity and inflation over time.
