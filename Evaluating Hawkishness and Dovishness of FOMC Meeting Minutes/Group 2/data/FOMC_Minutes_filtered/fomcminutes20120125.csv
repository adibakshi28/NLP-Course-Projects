" However, a third study, which employed householdlevel data, suggested that movements in consumption before, during, and after the recession were driven primarily by employment, income, and net worth, leaving little variation to be explained by changes in leverage and credit availability."
" Participants also considered the possible influence on aggregate consumer spending of changes in real interest rates and the distribution of income, the potential for policy actions to affect the fundamental factors driving household saving, and whether households’ spending behavior is being affected by concerns about the future of Social Security."
" Any such adjustment shall be made in the context of the Committee’s discussion and decision at its most recent meeting and the Committee’s longrun objectives for price stability and sustainable econo mic growth, and shall be based on economic, financial, and monetary developments during the intermeeting period."
" In his view, such intervention would be ineffective if it did not also signal a shift in domestic monetary policy; and if it did signal such a shift, it could potentially compromise the Federa l Reserve’s monetary policy independence."
"For this purpose, the overall open position in all foreign currencies is defined as the sum (disregarding signs) of net positions in individual currencies, excluding changes in dollar value due to foreign exchange rate movements and interest accruals."
" For the purpose of providing an investment return on System holdings of foreign currencies or for the purpose of adjusting interest rates paid or received in connection with swap drawings, transactions with foreign central banks may be undertaken at nonmarket exchange rates."
"System operations in foreign currencies shall generally be directed at counte ring disorderly market conditions, provided that market exchange rates for the U.S. dollar reflect actions and behavior consistent with IMF Article IV, Section 1."
"  Statement on LongerRun Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy Following the Committee’s disposition of organizational matters, participants considered a revised draft of a statement of principles regarding the FOMC’s longerrun goals and monetary policy strategy."
" Instead, the statement was intended to help enhance the transparency, accountability, and effectiveness of monetary policy."
" Second, the statement specifies a numerical inflation goal in a context that firmly underscores the Federal Reserve’s commitment to fostering both parts of its dual mandate."
"All participants but one supported adopting the revised statement of principles regarding longerrun goals and monetary policy strategy, which is reproduced below."
"“Following careful deliber ations at its recent meetings, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has reached broad agreement on the following principles regarding its longerrun goals and monetary policy strategy."
"The FOMC is firmly committed to fulfilling its statutory mandate from the Congress of promoting maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate longterm interest rates."
 The Committee seeks to explain its monetary policy decisions to the public as clearly as possible.
" Such clarity facilitates wellinformed decisionmaking by households and businesses, reduces economic and financial uncertainty, increases the effectiveness of monetary policy, and enhances transparency and accountability, which are essential in a democratic society."
" Inflation, employment, and longterm interest rates fluctuate over time in response to economic and financial disturbances."
" Moreover, monetary policy actions tend to influence economic activity and prices with a lag."
" The inflation rate over the longer run is primarily determined by monetary policy, and hence the Committee has the ability to specify a longerrun goal for inflation."
" The Committee judges that inflation at the rate of 2 percent, as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, is most consistent over the longer run with the Federal Reserve’s statutory mandate."
" Communicating this inflation goal clearly to the public helps keep longerterm inflation expectations firmly anchored, thereby fostering price stability and moderate longterm interest rates and enhancing the Committee’s ability to  promote maximum employment in the face of significant economic disturbances."
 The maximum level of employment is largely determined by nonmonetary factors that affect the structure and dynamics of the labor market.
" Consequently, it would not be appropriate to specify a fixed goal for employment; rather, the Committee’s policy decisions must be informed by assessments of the maximum level of employment, recognizing that such assessments are necessarily uncertain and subject to revision."
 Information about Committee participants’ estimates of the longerrun normal rates of output growth and unemployment is published four times per year in the FOMC’s Summary of Economic Projections.
" For example, in the most recent projections, FOMC participants’ estimates of the longerrun normal rate of unemployment had a central tendency of 5.2 percent to     6.0 percent, roughly unchanged from last January but substantially higher than the corresponding interval several years earlier."
" In setting monetary policy, the Committee seeks to mitigate deviations of inflation from its longerrun goal and deviations of employment from the Co mmittee’s assessments of its maximum level."
" However, under circumstances in which the Committee judges that the objectives are not complementary, it follows a balanced approach in promoting them, taking into account the magnitude of the deviations and the potentially different time horizons over which employment and inflation are projected to return to levels judged consistent with its mandate.” All FOMC members voted to adopt this statement except Mr. Tarullo, who abstained because he questioned the ultimate usefulness of the statement in promoting better communication of the Committee’s policy strategy."
"Staff Review of the Economic Situation  The information reviewed at the January 24–25 meeting indicated that U.S. economic activity continued to expand moderately, while global growth appeared to be slowing."
" Overall conditions  in the labor market improved further, although the unemployment rate remained elevated."
" Consum er price inflation was subdued, and measures of longrun inflation expectations remained stable."
"The unemployment rate declined to 8.5 percent in December; however, both longduration unemployment and the share of workers employed part time for economic reasons were still quite  high."
" Private nonfarm employment continued to expand moderately, while Page 8Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________state and local government employment decreased at a slower pace than earlier in 2011."
" Initial claims for unemployment insurance edged lower, on balance, since the middle of December but remained at a level consistent with only modest employment growth."
" Motor vehicle assemblies were scheduled to increase, on balance, in the first quarter of 2012, and broader indicators of manufacturing activity, such as the diffusion indexes of new orders from the national and regional manufacturing surveys, were at levels that suggested moderate growth in production in the near term."
The U.S. international trade deficit widened in November as exports fell and imports rose.
" Nearterm inflation expectations from the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers were essentially unchanged in early January, and longerterm inflation expectations remained stable."
Recent indicators of foreign economic activity pointed to a substantial deceleration in the fourth quarter of 2011.
" Twelvemonth inflation rates receded in several advanced and emerging market economies, and most central banks maintained policy rates or eased further while continuing to provide significant liquidity support."
 Indicators of inflation compensation derived from nominal and inflationprotected Treasury securities edged up.
" Although mortgage interest rates and yields on currentcoupon ag ency MBS edged down to Page 10Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________near their historical lows, mortgage refinancing activity continued to be subdued amid tight underwriting standards and low levels of home  equity."
"In the fourth quarter, bank credit continued to increase as banks accumulated agency MBS and growth of total loans picked up."
 Growth of C&I loans at domestic banks was robust but was partly offset by weakness at U.S. branches and agencies of European banks.
" Responses to the January SLOOS indicated that, in the aggregate, loan demand strengthened slightly and lending standards eased a bit furt her in the fo urth quarter."
"M2 increased at an annual rate of 5¼ percent in December, likely reflecting continued demand for safe and liquid assets given investor concerns over developments in Europe."
" In addition, demand deposits rose rapidly around yearend, reportedly because lenders in shortterm funding markets chose to leave substantial balances with banks over the turn of the year."
" The monetary base increased in December, largely reflecting growth in currency."
" Shortterm euro interest rates moved lower as euroarea institutions drew a substantial amount of threeyear funds from the ECB, and dollar funding costs for European banks also  appeared to decline."
"Staff Economic Outlook  In the economic forecast prepared for the January FOMC meeting, the staff’s projection for the growth in real gross domestic product (GDP) in the near term was revised down a bit."
 The mediumterm projection for real GDP growth in the January forecast was little changed from the one presented in December.
" Although the developments in Europe were expected to continue to weigh on the U.S. economy during the first half of this year, the staff still projected that real GDP growth would acce lerate gradually in 2012 and 2013, supported by acco mmodative monetary policy, further improvements in credit availability, and risMinutes of the Meeting of January 24–25, 2012Page 11_____________________________________________________________________________________________ing consumer and business sentiment."
" The increase in real GDP was expected to be  sufficient to reduce the slack in product and labor markets only slowly over the projection period, and the unemployment rate was anticipated to still be high at the end of 2013."
" With stable longrun inflation expectations and substantial slack in labor and product markets anticipated to persist over the forecast period, the staff continued to project that inflation would remain subdued in 2012 and 2013."
"Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, all participants—the five members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks—provided projections of output growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2011 through 2014 and over the l onger run."
" Longerrun projections represent each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy."
"In their discussion of the economic situation and outlook, meeting participants agreed that the information received since the Committee met in December suggested that the economy had been expanding moderately, notwithstanding some slowing in growth abroad."
" In general, labor market indicators pointed to some further improvement in labor market conditions, but progress was gradual and the unemployment rate remained elevated."
" Household spending had continued to advance at a moderate pace despite stillsluggish growth in real disposable income, but growth in business fixed investment had slowed."
" Many participants observed that some indicators bearing on the economy’s recent performance had shown greaterthan-expected improvement, but a number also noted less favorable data; one noted that growth in final sales appeared to have slowed in the fourth quarter of last year even as output growth picked up."
" Inflation had been subdued in recent months, there was little evidence of wage or cost pressures, and longerterm inflation expectations had remained stable."
"With respect to the economic outlook, participants generally anticipated that economic growth over coming quarters would be modest  and, consequently, expected that the unemployment rate would decline only gradually."
" A number of factors were seen as likely to restrain the pace of economic expansion, including the slowdown in economic activity abroad, fiscal tightening in the United States, the weak housing market, further household deleveraging, high levels of uncertainty among households and businesses, and the possibility of increased volatility in fi nancial markets until the fiscal and banking issues in the euro area are more fully addressed."
" With unemployment expected to remain elevated, and with longerterm inflation expectations stable, almost all participants expected inflation to remain subdued in coming quarters—that is, to run at or below the 2 percent level that the Committee judges most consistent with its statutory mandate over the longer run."
" Several participants observed that consumer spending had outpaced growth in personal disposable income last year, and a few noted that households remained pessimistic about their income prospects and uncertain about the economic outlook."
 These observations suggested that growth of consumer spending might slow.
" However, a few other participants pointed to increasing job gains in recent months as contributing to an improving trend in real incomes and thus supporting continued moderate growth in consumer spending."
 The combination of high energy prices and availability of new drilling technologies was promoting strong growth in investment outlays in the energy sector.
Participants generally expected that growth of U.S. exports was likely to be held back in the coming year by slower global economic growth.
" In particular, fiscal austerity programs in Europe  and stresses in the European banking system seemed likely to restrain economic growth there, perhaps with some spillover to growth in Asia."
"Participants agreed that recent indicators showed some further gradual improvement in overall labor market conditions:  Payroll employment had increased somewhat more rapidly in recent months, new claims for unemployment insurance ha d trended lower, and the unemployment rate had declined."
" However, unemployment—including longerterm unemployment—remained elevated, and the numbers of discouraged workers and people working part time because they could not find fulltime work were also still quite high."
" Very high longduration unemployment might indicate a mismatch between unemployed workers’ skills and employers’ needs, suggesting that a substantial part of the increase in unemployment since the beginning of the recession reflected factors other than a shortfall in aggregate demand."
" A few participants noted that the recent decline in the unemployment rate reflected declining labor force participation in large part, and judged that the decline in the participation rate was likely to be reversed, at least to some extent, as the recovery continues and labor demand picks up."
" U.S. banks reported increase s in commercial lending as some European lenders pulled back, and some banking contacts indicated that creditworthy companies’ demand for credit had increased."
"Participants observed that longerrun inflation expectations were still well anchored  and also noted that inflation had been subdued in recent months, partly reflectMinutes of the Meeting of January 24–25, 2012Page 13_____________________________________________________________________________________________ing a decline in commodity prices and an easing of supply chain disruptions since mid2011."
" In addition, labor compensation had risen only slowly and productivity continued to increase."
" One participant reported that a survey of business inflation expectations indicated firms were anticipating increases in unit costs on the order of 1¾ percent this year, just a bit higher than last year."
" Looking farther ahead, participants generally judged that the modest expansion in economic activity that they were projecting would be consistent with a gradual reduction in the curre nt wide margins of slack in labor and product markets and with subdued inflation going forward."
" Some remained concerned that, with the persistence of considerable resource slack, inflation might continue to drift down and run below mandateconsistent levels for some time."
" However, a couple of participants were concerned that inflation could rise as the recovery continued and argued that providing additional monetary accommodation, or even maintaining the current highly accommodative stance of monetary policy over the medium run, would erode the stability of inflation expe ctations and risk higher inflation."
 Many participants thought it important to explore means for better communicating policymakers’ thinking about future monetary policy and it s relationship to evolving economic conditions.
" Several participants thought it would be helpful to provide more information about the economic conditions that would be likely to warrant maintaining the current target range for the federal funds rate, perhaps by providing numerical thresholds for the unemployment and inflation rates."
" However, some participants worried that such thresholds would not accurately or effectively convey the Committee’s forwardlooking approach to monetary policy and thus would pose difficult communications issues, or that movements in the unemployment rate, by themselves, would be an unreliable measure of progress toward maximum employment."
 Participants agreed to continue exploring approaches for providing the public with greater clarity about the linkages between the economic outlook and the Committee’s monetary policy decisions.
Committee Policy Action Members viewed the information on U.S. economic activity received over the intermeeting period as suggesting that the economy had been expanding moderately and generally agreed that the economic outlook had not changed greatly since they met in December.
" While overall labor market conditions had improved somewhat further and unemployment had declined in recent months, almost all members viewed the unemployment rate as still elevated relative to levels that they saw as consistent with the Committee’s mandate over the longer run."
" Available data indicated some slowing in the pace of economic growth in Europe and in some emerging market economies, pointing to reduced growth of U.S. exports going forward."
" With the economy facing continuing headwinds from the recent financial crisis and with growth slowing in a number of U.S. export markets, members generally expected a modest pace of economic growth over coming quarters, with the unemployment rate declining only gradually."
 Strains in global financial markets continued to pose significant downside ri sks to economic activity.
" Inflation had been subdued in recent months, and longerterm inflation expect ations remained stable."
 Members generally anticipated that inflation over coming quarters would run at or below the 2 percent level that the Committee judges most consistent with its mandate.
"In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members agreed that it would be appropriate to maintain the existing highly accommodative stance of monetary policy."
" In light of the economic outlook, almost all members agreed to indicate that the Committee expects to maintain a highly accommodative stance for monetary policy and currently anticipates that economic conditions—including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run—are likely to warrant ex ceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through late 2014, longer than had been indicated in recent FOMC statements."
" In particular, several members said they anticipated that unemployment would still be well above their estimates of its longerterm normal rate, and inflation would be at or below the Committee’s longerrun objective, in late 2014."
" A few members observed that, in their judgme nt, current and prospective economic conditions—including elevated unemployment and inflation at or below the Committee’s objective—could warrant the initiation of additional securities purchases before long."
 Other members indicated that such policy action could become necessary if the economy lost momentum or if inflation seemed likely to remain below its mandateconsistent rate of 2 percent over the medium run.
" In contrast, one member judged that maintaining the current degree of policy accommodation beyond the near term would likely be inappropriate; that member anticipated that a preemptive tightening of monetary policy would be necessary before the end of 2014 to keep inflation close to 2 percent."
"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct  the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was in structed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: “The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output."
" The System Open Market Account Manager and the Secretary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the System’s balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the Committee’s objectives of maximum employment and price stability.” The vote encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 12:30 p.m.: “Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in December suggests that the economy has been expanding moderately, notwithstanding some slowing in global growth."
" While indicators point to some further improv ement in overall labor market conditions, the unemployment rate remains elevated."
" Household spending has continued to advance, but growth in business fixed investme nt has slowed, and Minutes of the Meeting of January 24–25, 2012Page 15_____________________________________________________________________________________________the housing sector remains depressed."
" Inflation has been subdued in recent months, and longerterm inflation expectations have remained stable."
" Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
 The Committee expects economic growth over coming quarters to be modest and consequently anticipates that the unempl oyment rate will decline only gradually toward levels that the Committee judges to be consistent with its d u a l  m a n d a t e .
" The Committee also anticipates that over coming quarters, inflation will run at levels at or below those consistent with the Committee’s dual mandate."
" To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at levels consistent with the dual mandate, the Committee expects to maintain a highly accommodative stance for monetary policy."
" In particular, the Co mmittee decided today to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and currently anticipates that economic conditions—including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run—are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through late 2014."
 He expected that a preemptive tightening of monetary policy would be necessary to prevent an increase in inflation projections or inflation expectations prior to the end of 2014.
"English Secretary  Page 16Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________Summary of Economic Projections In conjunction with the January 24–25, 2012, Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, the members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks, a ll of whom participate in the deliberations of the FOMC, submitted projections for growth of real output, the unemployment rate, and inflation for the years 2012 to 2014 and over the longer run."
" The economic projections were based on information available at the time of the meeting and participants’ individual assumptions about factors likely to affect economic outcomes, including their assessments of appropriate monetary policy."
  Longerrun projections represent each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge over time under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks.
 “Appropriate monetary policy” is defined as the future path of policy that participants deem most likely to foster outcomes for economic activity and inflation that best satisfy their individual interpretation of the Federal Reserve’s objectives of maximum employment and stable prices.
 Participants ge nerally anticipated only a small decline in the unemployment rate this year.
" In 2013 and 2014, the pace of the expansion was projected to exceed participants’ estimates of the longerrun sustainable rate of increase in real GDP by enough to result in a gradual further decline in the unemployment rate."
" However, at the end of 2014, participants generally expected that the unemployment rate would still be well above their estimates of the longerrun normal unemployment rate that they currently view as consistent with the FOMC’s statutory mandate for promoting maximum employme nt and price stability."
" Participants viewed the upward pressures on inflation in 2011 from factors such as supply chain disruptions and rising commodity prices as having waned, and they anticipated that inflation woul d fall back in 2012."
" Over the projection period, most participants expected inflation, as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), to be at or below the FOMC’s objective of 2 percent that was expressed in the Commi ttee’s statement of longerrun goals and policy strategy."
 Core inflation was projected to run at about the same rate as overall inflation.
2.5 to 2.9 3.0 to 3.5 3.0 to 3.9 2.4 to 2.7 2.3 to 3.5 2.7 to 4.0 2.7 to 4.5 2.2 to 3.0 Unemployment rate.

" PCE infl ation and core PCE inflation are the percentage rates of change in, respectively, the price index for personal consumption expenditur es (PCE) and the price index for PCE excluding food and energy."
 Projections for the unemployment rate are for the average civilian unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of the yea r indicated.
 Each participant’ s projections are based on his or  her assessment of appropriate monetary policy.
 Longerrun projections represent each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy.
 Longerrun projections for core PCE inflation are not collected.

"The data for the change in realGDP, PCE inflation, and core PCE inflation shown for 2011 incorporate the advance estimate of GDP for the fourth quarter of 2011, which the Bureauof Economic Analysis released on January 27, 2012."
" With the unemployment rate having declined in recent months by more than participants had anticipated in the previous Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), they generally lowered their forecasts for the level of the unemployment rate over the next two years."
 Participants’ expectations for both the longerrun rate of increase in real GDP and the longerrun unemployment rate were little changed from November.
 They did not significantly alter their forecasts fo r the rate of inflation over the next three years.
" However, in light of the 2 percent inflation that is the objective included in the statement of longerrun goals and policy strategy adopted at the January meeting, the range and central tendency of their projections of longerrun inflation were all equal to 2 percent."
"As shown in figure 2, most participants judged that highly accommodative monetary policy was likely to be warranted over coming years to promote a stronger economic expansion in the context of price stability."
" In particular, with the unemployment rate projected to remain elevated over the projection period and inflation expected to be subdued, six participants anticipated that, under appropriate monetary policy, the first increase in the target federal funds rate would occur after 2014, and five expect ed policy firming to commence during 2014 (the uppe r panel)."
 The remaining six participants judged that  raising the federal funds rate sooner would be required to forestall inflationary pressures or avoid distortions in the financial system.
A sizable majority of participants continued to judge the level of uncertainty associated with their projections for real activity and the unemployment rate as unusually high relative to historical norms.
" Many also attached a greaterthan-normal level of uncertainty to their forecasts for inflation, but, compared with the November SEP, two additional participants viewed uncertainty as broadly similar to longerrun norms."
" As in November, many participants saw downside risks attending their forecasts of real GDP growth  and upside risks to their forecasts of the unemployment rate; most participants viewed the risks to their inflation projections as broadly balanced."
The Outlook for Economic Activity The central tendency of participants’ forecasts for the c h a n g e  i n  r e a l  G D P  i n  2 0 1 2  was 2.2 to 2.7 percent.
" This forecast for 2012, while  slightly lower than the projection prepared in November, would represent a pickup in output growth from  2011 to a rate close to its longerrun trend."
" Participants stated that the economic information received since November showed continued gradual improvement in the pace of economic activity during the second ha lf of 2011, as the influence of the temporary factors that damped activity in the first half of the year subsided."
" Participants also read the information on economic activity abroad, particularly in Europe, as pointing to weaker demand for U.S. exports in coming quarters than had seemed likely when they prepared their forecasts in November."
"Participants anticipated that the pace of the economic expansion would strengthen over the 2013–14 period, reaching rates of increase in real GDP above their estimates of the longerrun rates of output growth."
"Overview of FOMC participants’ assessments of appropriate monetary policy                     Appropriate Timing of Policy Firming                     Number of Participants             Appropriate Pace of Policy Firming                           Percent            NOTE: In the upper panel, the height of each bar denotes the number of FOMC participants who judge that, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy, the first increase in the target federal funds rate from its current range of 0 to ¼ percent will occur in the specified calendar year."
" Among the considerations supporting their forecasts, participants cited their expectation that the expansion would be supported by monetary policy accommodation, ongoing improvements in credit conditions, rising household and business confidence, and strengthening household balance sheets."
" Many participants judged that U.S. fiscal policy would still be a drag on economic activity in 2013, but many anticipated that progress would be made in resolving the fiscal situation in Europe and that the foreign economic outlook would be more positive."
"The unemployment rate improved more in late 2011 than most participants had anticipated when they prepared their November projections, falling from 9.1 to 8.7 percent between the third and fourth quarters."
" As a result, most participants adjusted down their projections for the unemployment rate this year."
" The central tendency of participants’ forecasts for the unemployment rate at the end of 2013 was 7.4 to 8.1 per cent, and it was 6.7 to  7.6 percent at the end of 2014."
 The central tendency of participants’ estimates of the longerrun normal rate of unemployment that would prevail in the absence of further shocks was 5.2 to 6.
" Most participants indicated that they anticipated that five or six years would be required to close the gap between the current unemployment rate and their estimates of the longerrun rate, although some noted that more time would likely be needed."
Figures 3.A and 3.B provide details on the diversity of participants’ views regarding the likely outcomes for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate over the next three years and over the longer run.
" The dispersion in these projections refl ected differences in participants’ assessments of many factors, including appropriate monetary policy and its effects on economic activity, the underlying momentum in economic activity, the effects of the European situation, the prospective path for U.S. fiscal policy, the likely evolution of credit and financial market conditions, and the extent of structural dislocations in the labor market."
" Compared with their November projections, the range of participants’ forecasts for the ch ange in real GDP in 2012 narrowed somewhat and shifte d slightly lower, as some participants reassessed the outlook for global economic growth and for U.S. fiscal  policy."
" Many, however, made no material change to their forecasts for growth of real GDP this year."
" Having incorporated the data showing a lower rate of unemployment at the end of 2011 than previously expected, the distribution of participants’ projections for the end of 2012 shifted noticeably down relative to the November fore casts."
" The ranges for the unemployment rate in 2013 and 2014 showed less pronounced shifts toward lower rates and, as was the case with the ranges for output growth, remained wide."
" Participants made only modest adjustments to their projections of the rates of output growth and unemployment over the longer run, and, on net, the dispersions of their projections for both were little changed from those reported in November."
" The dispersion of estimates for the longerrun rate of output growth is narrow, with only one participant’s estimate outside of a range of 2.2 to 2.7 percent."
" By comparison, participants’ views about the level to which the unemployment rate would converge in the long run are more diverse, reflecting, among other things, different views on the outlook for labor supply and on the extent of structural impediments in the labor market."
The Outlook for Inflation Participants generally viewed the outlook for inflation as very similar to that in  November.
" Most indicated that, as they expected, the effects of the runup in prices of energy and other commodities and the supply disruptions that occurred in the first half of 2011 had largely waned, and that inflation had been subdued in recent months."
 Participants also noted that inflation expectations had remained s table over the past year despite the fluctuations in headline inflation.
" Assuming no further supply shocks, most participants anticipated that both headline and core inflation would remain subdued over the 2012–14 period at rates at or below the FOMC’s longerrun objective of 2 percent."
" Specifically, the central tendency of participants’ projections for the increase in inflation, as measured by the PCE price index, in 2012 was 1.4 to  1.8 percent, and it edged up to a central tendency of 1.6 to 2.0 percent in 2014; the central tendencies of the forecasts for core PCE Summary of Economic Projections of the Meeting of January 24–25, 2012Page 5_____________________________________________________________________________________________24681012141618Number of participantsFigure 3.A.

Figures 3.C and 3.D provide information about the diversity of participants’ views about the outlook for inflation.
" Compared with their November projections, expectations for inflation in  2012 shifted down a bit, with some participants noting that the slowing in inflation at the end of 2011 had been greater than they anticipated."
" Nonetheless, the range of participants’ forecasts for inflation in 2012 re mained wide, and the dispersion was only slightly narrower in 2013."
" By 2014, the range of inflation forecasts narrowed more noticeably, as participants expected that, under appropriate monetary policy, inflation would begin to converge to the Committee’s longerrun objective."
" In general, the dispersion of views on the outlook for inflation over the projection period represented differences in judgments regarding the degree of slack in resource utilization and the extent to which slack influences inflation and inflation expectations."
" In addition, participants differed in their estimates of how the stance of monetary policy would influence inflation expectations."
Appropriate Monetary Policy Most participants judged that the current outlook—for a moderate pace of economic recovery with the unemployment rate declining on ly gradually and inflation subdued—warranted exceptio nally low levels of the federal funds rate at least un til late 2014.
Participants’ assessments of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate reflected their judgments of the policy that would best support progress in achieving the Federal Reserve’s mandate for promoting maximum employment and stable prices.
" Among the key factors informing participants’ expectations about the appropriate setting for monetary policy were their assessments of the maximum level of employment, the Committee’s longerrun inflation goal, the extent to which current conditions deviate from these mandateconsistent levels, and their projections of the likely time horizons required to return employment and inflation to such levels."
" Several pa rticipants commented that their assessments took into account the risks to the outlook for economic activity and inflation, and a few pointed specifically to the re levance of financial stability in their policy judgments."
" Participants also noted that because the appropriate stance of monetary policy depends importantly on the evolution of real activity and inflation over time, their assessments of the appropriate future path of the federal funds rate could change if economic conditions were to evolve in an unexpected manner."
" The longerrun nominal levels were in a range from 3¾ to 4½ percent, reflecting participants’ judgments about the longerrun equilibrium level of the real federal funds rate and the Committee’s inflation objective of 2 percent."
" A few participants’ assessments of appropriate monetary policy incorporated additional purchases of longerterm securities in 2012, and a number of participants indicated that they remained open to a consideration of additional asset purchases if the economic outlook deteriorated."
" Those participants who judged that a longer period of exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate would be appropriate generally also anticipated that the pace of the economic expansion would be moderate and that the unemployment rate would decline only gradually, remaining well above its longerrun  rate at the end of 2014."
 Almost all of these participants expected that inflation would be relatively stable at or below the FOMC’s longerrun objective of 2 percent until the time of the first increase in the federal funds rate.
"  I n  c o n t r a s t , the six participants who judged that policy firming should begin in 2012 or 2013 indicated that the Committee would need to act decisively to keep inflation at ma ndateconsistent levels and to limit the risk of undermining Federal Reserve credibility and causing a rise in inflation expectations."
" Several were projecting a faster pickup in economic activity, and a few stressed the risk of distortions in the financial system from an extended period of exceptionally low interest rates."
"Uncertainty and Risks Figure 4 shows that most participants continued to share the view that their projections for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate were subject to a higher level of uncertainty than was the norm during the previous 20 years.1  Many also judged the level of uncertainty associated with their inflation forecasts to be  higher  than the  longer -run  norm, but  that assess1 Table 2 provides estimates of the forecast uncertainty for the change in real GDP, the unemployment rate, and total consumer price inflation over the period from 1991 to 2010."
±1.3 ±1.7 ±1.8 Unemployment rate1 .
" As described in the box “Forecast Unce rtainty,” under certain assumptions, there is about a 70 percent probabili ty that actual outcomes for real GDP, unemployment, and consumer prices will be in ranges implied by the average size of projection errors made in the past."
" Regarding the unemployment rate, several expressed uncertainty about how labor demand and supply would evolve over the forecast period."
 Among the sources of uncertainty about the outlook for inflation were the difficulties in assessing the current and prospective margins of slack in resource markets and the effect of such slack on prices.
"A majority of participants continued to report that they saw the risks to their foreca sts of real GDP growth as weighted to the downside and,  accordingly, the risks to their projections for the unemployment rate as skewed to the upside."
" All but one of the remaining participants viewed the risks to both projections as broadly balanced, while one noted a risk that the unemployment rate might continue to decline more rapidly than expected."

 A number of participants noted the risk of another disruption in global oil markets that could not only boost inflation but also reduce real income and spending.
 The participants who judged the risks to be broadly balanced also recognized a number of these downside risks to the outlook but saw them as counterbalanced by the possibility that the resilience of economic activity in late 2011 and the recent drop in the unemployment rate might signal greater underlying momentum in economic activity.
"In contrast to their outlook for economic activity, most participants judged the risks to their projections of inflation as broadly balanced."
" Participants generally viewed the recent decline in inflation as having been in line with their earlier forecasts, and they noted that inflation expectations remain stable."
" While many of these participants saw the persistence of substantial slack in resource utilization as likely to keep inflation subdued over the projection period, a few others noted the risk that elevated resource slack might put more downward pressure on inflation than expected."
" In contrast, some participants noted the upside risks to inflation from developments in global oil and commodity markets, and several indicated that the current highly accommodative stance of monetary policy and the substantial liquidity currently in the financial system risked a pickup in inflation to a level above the Committee’s objective."
 A few also pointed to the risk that uncertainty about the Committee’s ability to effectively remove policy accommodation when appropriate could lead to a rise in inflation expectations.
 Page 14Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________       Forecast Uncertainty    The economic projections provided by the members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks inform discussions of monetary policy among policymakers and can aid public understanding of the basis for policy actions.
" Thus, in setting the stance of monetary policy, participants consider no t only what appears to be the most likely economic outcome as embodied in their projections, but also the range of alternative possibilities, the likelihood of their occurring, and the potential costs to the economy should they occur."
"Table 2 summarizes the average historical accuracy of a range of forecasts, including those reported in past Monetary Policy Report s and those prepared by the Federal Reserve Board’s staff in advance of meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee."
 The corre sponding 70 percent confidence intervals for overall inflation would be 1.1 to 2.9 percent in the current year and 1.0 to 3.0 percent in the second and third years.
"As with real activity and inflation, the outlook for the future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable uncertainty."
 This uncertainty arises primarily because each participant’s assessment of the appropriate stance of monetary policy depends importantly on the evolution of real activity and inflation over time.
