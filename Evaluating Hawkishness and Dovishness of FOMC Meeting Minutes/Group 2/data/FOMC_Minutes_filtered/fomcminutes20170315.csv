" The monetary policies of other advanced -economy central banks  remained quite accommodative, and some signs of progress on central banks’ inflation mandates were evident."
" Late in the intermeeting period, market participants came to interpret U.S. monetary policy communications as implying high odds of a firming of m onetary policy at this meeting, and changes in market prices suggested a slightly steeper path for the federal funds rate over the next few years than was previously anticipated."
 Most participants expressed the view that changes in the target range for the federal funds rate should be the p rimary means for adjusting the stance of monetary policy when the federal funds rate was above its effective lower bound.
 A number of  participants indicated  that the Committee should resume asset purchases  only if substantially adverse economic circumstances warranted greater monetary policy accommodation than could be provided by lowering the federal funds rate to the effective lower bound.
" Moreover, it was noted that the Committee’s policy of maintaining reinvestments until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate was well under way had supported the smooth and effective conduct of monetary policy  and had helped maintain accommodative financial conditions ."
" The 12 -month change in consumer prices moved up in Minutes of the Meeting of March 14–15, 2017Page 3_____________________________________________________________________________________________   recent months and was close to the Committee’s longer -run objective of 2  percent; excluding food and energy prices, inflation was little changed and continued to run somewhat below 2 percent."
 Total nonfarm payroll employment increased at a brisk pace in January and February.
" The unemployment rate edged back down to 4.7  percent in February, and the labor force participation rate rose over the first two months of the year."
 The four -week moving average of initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits was at a very low level in early March.
" The unemployment rates for African Americans, for Hispanics, and for whites were close to the levels seen just before the most recent recession, but the unemployment rates for African Americans and for Hispanics remained above the rate f or whites."
" Total industrial production declined in January, as unseasonably warm weather reduced the demand for heating, which  held down the output of utilities."
" Recent readings on some key factors that influence consumer spending —including further gains in employment, real disposable personal income, and households’ net worth—were consistent with moderate increases in real PCE in early 2017."
 The limited available data suggested that inventory investment was likely to make a smaller contribution to real GDP growth in the early part of the year than it did in the fourth quarter.
" Net exports exerted a significant drag on real GDP growth in the fourth quarter of 2016, and the January trade data suggested that net exports would continue to weigh on growth in the first quarter of this year."
" The U.S. international trade deficit widened in January in nominal terms, with imports —led by consumer goods —rising more than exports."
" Core PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in food and energy prices, was 1¾ percent over those same 12  months, held down in part by decreases in the prices of non­energy impor ts over part of this period."
" Over the 12  months ending in February, total consumer prices as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) rose 2¾  percent, while core CPI inflation was 2¼  percent."
" The medians of survey -based measures of longer -run inflation  expectations —such as those from the Michigan survey, the Survey of Professional Forecasters, and the Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants —were little changed, on balance, in recent months."
" Foreign real GDP growth slowed a bit  in the fourth quarter from a relatively strong rate in the third quarter, but it was still somewhat higher than its average pace over the past two years."
" In much of the world, including Europe, Japan, and most of emerging Asia, economic activity continue d to grow at a moderate pace."
" I n Canada and Mexico —two important trading partners of the United States —growth stepped down from unusually strong third -quarter rates  to a stillsolid pace in the fourth quarter , and Brazil’s recession deepened."
" Recently re leased purchasing managers indexes and confidence indicators from abroad were generally upbeat and pointed to continued moderate foreign growth in early 2017, although indicators from Mexico suggested a further slowing."
" Inflation in the advanced foreign economies (AFEs) continued to rise, largely reflecting increases in retail energy prices and currency depreciation."
" Among the emerging market economies (EMEs), inflation rose in Mexico, in part reflecting a substantial hike in fuel prices, but fell in China and parts of South America."
" Treasury yields rose late in the intermeeting period, following monetary policy communications by se veral Federal Reserve officials."
 The Chair’s semiannual monetary policy testimony reportedly led market participants to price in a slightly higher probability of a monetary policy firming in the near term.
" Subsequently, investors took note of the mention in the minutes of the January – February FOMC meeting that many participants expressed the view that it might be appropriate to rais e the federal funds rate again fairly soon if incoming information on the labor market and inflation was in line with or stronger than their current expectations or if the risks of overshooting the Committee’s maximum - employment and inflation objectives i ncreased."
" Measures of inflation compensation based on Treasury Inflation -Protected Securities  were little changed , on net, since the February FOMC meeting."
" In contrast, the dollar appreciated against the Minutes of the Meeting of March 14–15, 2017Page 5_____________________________________________________________________________________________   AFE currencies, reflecting continued divergence in monetary policy expectations for the United States and AFEs as well as political uncertainty in Europe ."
" Bank loans continued to be largely available for small businesses, al though small business credit demand reportedly remained subdued."
" Despite the increase in Treasury yields, the interest rate on  30year fixed -rate mortgages was little changed over the intermeeting period."
" Consumer credit continued to increase at a steady pace, with similar growth rates across credit card, automobile, and student loans."
" The growth of consumer lending at banks continued in January and February, albeit at a slower pace than in the fourth quarter of 2016."
"  Staff Economic Outlook  In the U.S. eco nomic projection prepared by the staff for the March FOMC meeting, the near -term forecast for real GDP growth was a little weaker, on net, than in the previous projection."
" Real GDP was expected to expand at a slower rate in the first quarter than in the fourth quarter, reflecting some data for January that were judged to be transitorily weak, but growth was projected to move back up in the second quarter."
 The negative effect of this timing change on projected real GDP growth through 2019 was offset by a higher  assumed path for equity prices and by a lower assumed path for the exchange value of the dollar.
 The unemployment rate was forecast to edge down gradually through the end of 2019 and to run below the staff’s estimate of its longer -run natural rate; the path for the unemployment rate was little changed from the previous projection.
"The staff’s forecast for consumer price inflation , as measured by changes in the PCE price index,  was unchanged for 2017 as a whole and over the next couple of years."
" Th e staff continued to project that inflation would increase gradually over this period, as food and energy prices, along with the prices of non -energy imports, were expected to begin steadily rising this year."
" However, inflation was projected to be slightl y below the Committee’s longer -run objective of 2  percent in 2019."
" The staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as similar to the average of the past 20 years."
" The risks to the forecast for real GDP were seen as tilted to the downside, primarily reflecting the staff’s assessment that monetary policy appeared to be better positioned to respond to large positive shocks to the economic outlook than substantial adverse ones."
" Consistent with the downside risk s to aggregate demand, the staff viewed the risks to its outlook for the unemployment rate as tilted to the upside."
 The risks to the projection for inflation were seen as roughly balanced.
 The downside risks from the possibility that longer -term inflatio n expectations may have edged down or that the dollar could appreciate substantially further were seen as roughly counterbalanced by the upside risk that inflation could increase more than expected in an economy that was projected to continue operating above its longer -run potential.
" Participants ’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook  In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, members of the Board of Governors and Federal Reserve Bank presidents submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real output growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2017 throug h 2019 and over the longer run, based on their individual assessments of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate.4  The longer -run projections represented each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converg e, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy.5  These projections and policy assessments are described in the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), which is an addendum to these minutes."
" In their dis cussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants agreed that information received over the intermeeting period indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had continued to expand at a modera te pace."
 Job gains had remained solid and the unemployment rate was little changed in recent months.
" Inflation had increased in recent quarters and moved close to the Committee’s 2 percent longer -run objective; excluding energy and food prices, inflation was little changed and had continued to run somewhat below 2 percent."
" Market -based measures of inflation                                                  4 The office of the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta was vacant at the time of this FOMC meeting; the incoming president of  the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta is scheduled to assume office on June 5, 2017."
" Marie Gooding, compensation had remained low;  survey -based measures of inflation compensation were little changed on balance."
" Participants co ntinued to anticipate that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity would expand at a moderate pace, labor market conditions would strengthen somewhat further, and inflation would stabilize around 2 percent over the med ium term."
 Participants  continued to underscore the considerable uncertainty about the timing and nature of potential changes to fiscal policies as well as the size of the effects of such changes on economic activity.
" At the same time, some participants and their business contacts saw downside risks to labor force and economic growth from possible  changes to other government policies, such as those affecting immigration and trade ."
"  Regarding the outlook for inflation, several participants noted that the apparently modest response of inflation to measures of resource slack in recent years , along with  First Vice President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, submitted economic projections."
" 5 One participant did not submit longer -run projections for real output growth, the unemployment rate, or the federal funds rate."
"  Minutes of the Meeting of March 14–15, 2017Page 7_____________________________________________________________________________________________   inflation expectations that appeared to have remained well anchored , limited the risk of a marked pickup in inflation as the labor market tightened further."
" In contrast, some other participants continued to express co ncern that a substantial undershooting of the longer -run normal rate of unemployment, if it was to occur,  posed a significant upside risk to inflation, in part because of the possibility that the behavior of inflation   could differ from that in recent decades ."
 Participants generally agreed that it would be appropriate to continue to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments.
"     In their discussion of developments in the household sector, participan ts agreed that consumer spending was likely to contribute significantly to economic growth this year."
" In addition , conditions conducive t o growth in consumer spending, such as a strong labor market or higher levels of household wealth, were expected to persist."
" In the housing market, access to mortgage credit that was still restricted for some borrowers, constraints on buildable land in some regions, and rising interest rates were cited as having continued to res train the recovery in housing."
" Investment in oil drilling, and particularly extraction from shale, was described as increasing in a couple of Districts, and demand for related production inputs was also said to be expanding."
" Nonetheless, slow er economic growth, ample existing capacity, and modest returns in the energy sector were noted as factors that were  continuing to res train overall capital spending."
" Monthly increases in nonfarm payroll employment averaged nearly 210,000 over the three months ending in February, the unemployment rate edged down, and the labor force participation rate ticked up."
" In contrast, several other participants cited evidence that some slack remained in the labor market, such  as still -modest aggregate wage growth and the unevenness of wage gains across industries, an elevated share of employees working part time for economic reasons, or other broad measures of labor underutilization."
" Most participants still expected that if economic growth stayed moderate , as they projected, the unemployment rate would remain only modestly below their estimates of the longer -run normal rate of unemployment over the next few years."
   Participants generally viewed the information received over the intermeeting period as reinforcing their expectation that inflation would stabilize around the Committee’s 2 percent objective over the medium term.
" The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas’s  12month trimmed mean PCE inflation rate had gradually increased over the past couple of years, reaching 1.9 percent in January."
" Al though m arket -based measures of inflation compensation had remained low, they were  somewhat above the levels seen last year."
" In addition, longer -term inflation expectations in the Michigan survey had been relatively stable since the beginning of the year, while other survey measures of inflation expectations, such as the three -yearahead measure from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Survey of Consumer Expectations, had increased in recent months."
" Notwithstanding these developments, some participants cautioned that  progress toward the Committee’s inflation objective should not be overstated ; they noted that inflation had been persistently below 2 percent during the current economic expansion and that core inflation on a 12 -month basis was little changed in recent months at a level below 2  percent."
" In contrast,  a few other  participants comme nted that recent inflation data were stronger than they had expected and that they anticipated that inflation would reach the Committee’s objective of 2 percent this year ."
"In their discussion of recent developments in financial markets, participants noted that financial conditions remained accommodative despite the rise in longer -term interest rates in recent months and continued to support the expansion of economic activity."
 A few participants attributed the recent equity price appreciation to expectations for corporate tax cuts or to increased risk tolerance among investor s rather than to expectations of stronger economic growth.
" In their consideration of monetary policy, participants generally agreed that the data over the intermeeting period were broadly in line with their expectations, providing e vidence of further strengthening of labor market conditions and ongoing progress toward the Committee’s objective of 2 percent inflation."
" They judged that, even after an increase in the target range, the stance of monetary policy would remain accommodative, supporting some additional strengthening in labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation."
" With their views of the outlook for the economy little changed, participants generally continued to judge that a gradual pace of rate increases was likely to be appropriate to promote the Committee’s objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation."
" A few noted that it could take some time for inflation to rise to 2 percent on a sustained basis, and thus monetary policy would likely need to remain accommodative for a while longer in order to support the economic conditions that would foster such an increase."
 Several participants remarked that risk -management considerations still argued for a gradual removal of accommodation because the proximity of the federal funds rate to the effective lower bound placed constr aints on the ability of monetary policy to respond to adverse shocks.
" Moreover, the neutral real rate —defined as the real interest rate that is neither expansionary nor contractionary when the economy is operating at or near its potential —still appeared t o be low by historical standards."
" Furthermore, uncertainty about current and prospective values of the neutral real rate reinforced the argument for a gradual approach to removing monetary policy accommoda tion over the next few years."
" These risks  included the possibility of stronger spending by businesses and households as a result of improved sentiment, appreciably more expansionary fiscal policy, or a more rapid buildup of inflationary pressures than anticipated."
   Nearly all participan ts judged that the U.S. economy was operating at or near maximum employment.
" In contrast, participants held different views regarding prospects for the attainment of the Committee’s inflation goal."
" A number of participants noted that core inflation was a  useful indicator of future headline inflation, and the latest reading on 12 -month core inflation suggested that it could still be some time before headline inflation reached 2 percent on a sustained basis."
" Moreover, several participants remarked that eve n though inflation was currently not that far below the Committee’s 2 percent objective, it was important for the Committee to remove accommodation gradually to help ensure that inflation would stabilize around that objective over the medium term."
 These p articipants emphasized that a sustained return to 2 percent inflation was particularly important in light of the persistent shortfall of inflation from its objective over the past several years.
" However, se veral other  participants judged that —with the hea dline PCE price index rising nearly 2 percent and the core PCE index increasing close to 1 ¾ percent over the 12 -month period ending in January —the Committee essentially had met its inflation goal or was poised to meet it later this year."
" Committee Policy Action  In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members  judged that the information received since the Committee’s previous meeting indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had continued to expand at a moderate pace."
" Job gains had remained solid, and the unemployment rate had changed little in recent months."
" Inflation had increased in recent quarters, with the  12month change i n the headline PCE price index r ising to nearly 2 percent in January , close to the Committee’s longer -run objective."
" However, n early all members judged that the Committee had not yet achieved its objective for headline inflation on a sustained basis."
 M embers generally viewed it as important to highlight that core inflation—which excludes volatile energy and food prices and historically has tend ed to be a good indicator of future headline inflation —was little changed and continued to run somewhat below 2 percent.
" Moreover, market -based measures of inflation compensation had remained low."
" With respect to the economic outlook and its implications for monetary policy, members continued to expect that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy , economic activity would expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions would strengthen somewhat further."
 It was noted that r ecent increases in consumer energy prices could cause inflation to temporarily reach or even rise a bit above 2 percent i n the near term.
 Members anticipated that inflation would stabilize around 2  percent over the medium term and commented that transitory deviations above and below 2 percent were to be expected.
 Members agreed that they would continue to clo sely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments.
" After assessing current conditions and the outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, all but one member agreed to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to ¾ to 1 percent."
 This increase was viewed as appropriate in light of the further progress that had been made toward the Committee’s objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.
 That member preferred to await additional information on the amount of slack remaining in the labor market and increased evidence that inflation would stabilize at Page 10Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________   the Committee’s objective before taking another step to remove monetary policy accommodation.
"  Members agreed that, in determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee would assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation."
"This assessment would take into account a wide range of information, inc luding measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
" Partly i n light of the likelihood that the recent higher readings on headline inflation had  mostly reflected the temporary effect of increases in consumer energy prices, members agreed that the Committee would continue to carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to its inflation goal."
 A few members expressed the view that the Committee should avoid policy actions or communications that might be interpreted as suggesting that the Committee’s 2 percent inflation objective was actually a ceiling.
" S everal members observed that an explicit recognition in the statement that the Committee’s inflation goal was symmetric could help support inflation expectations at a level consistent with that goal, and it was noted  that a symmetric inflation objective implied that the Committee would adjust the stance of monetary policy in response to inflation that was either persistently above or persistently below 2  percent."
” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00  p.m.: “Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met  in February indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has continued to expand at a moderate pace.
 Job gains remained solid and the unemployment rate was little changed in recent months.
" Inflation has increased in recent quarters, moving close to the Committee’s 2 percent longer -run objective; excluding energy and food prices, inflation was litt le changed and continued to run somewhat below 2  percent."
" Market -based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey -based measures of longer -term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance."
" Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
" The Committee expects that, Minutes of the Meeting of March 14–15, 2017Page 11_____________________________________________________________________________________________   with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat further, and inflation will stabilize around 2 percent over the medium term."
 The Committee continues to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments.
" In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to ¾ to 1  percent."
" The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting some further strengthe ning in labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2  percent inflation."
" In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions rela tive to its objectives of maximum employment and 2  percent inflation."
" This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and read ings on financial and international developments."
 The Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to its symmetric inflation goal.
" In his view, recent data had not pointed to further progress on the Committee’s dual objectives and thus had not provided a compelling case to firm monetary policy at this meeting."
 He preferred to await additional information on the amount of slack remaining in the labor market and increased evidence that inflation would stabilize at the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent inflation objective before taking another step to remove monetary policy accommodation.
"  Mr. Kashkari also preferred that when data do support a removal of monetary policy accommodation, the FOMC first publish a detailed plan to normalize its balance sheet before proceeding with further increases in the federal funds rate."
" To support the Committee ’s decision to raise the target range for the federal funds rate, the Board of Governors voted unanimously to raise the interest rates on required and excess reserve balances ¼  percentage point, to 1 percent, effective March  16, 2017."
" (Secretary’s note:  Subsequently, the Federal Reserve Banks of New York, St. Louis, and Minneapolis were informed by the S ecretary of the Board of the Board’s approval of their establishment of a primary credit rate of 1½  percent, effective March  16, 2017.)  The second vote of the Board also encompassed approval of the establishment of the interest rates for secondary and seasonal credit under the existing formulas for computing such rat es."
"Madigan  Secretary Minutes of the Meeting of March 14–15, 2017Page 13_____________________________________________________________________________________________    Summary of Economic ProjectionsIn conjunction with the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting held on March 14 –15, 201 7, meeting participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real output growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2017 to 2019 and over the longer run.1  Each participant’s projection was based on information available at the time of the meeting, together with his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy, including a path for the federal funds rate and its longer -run value, and assumptions about other fa ctors likely to affect economic outcomes."
" The long errun projections represent each participant’s assessment of the value to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shoc ks to the economy.2  “Appropriate monetary policy” is defined as the future p ath of policy that each partici pant deems most li kely to foster outcomes for eco nomic activity and inflation that best satisfy his or her individual interpretat ion of the Federal Reserve’s ob jectives of maximum employment and stable prices."
" Most FOMC participants expected that, under appropriate monetary policy, growth in real gross domestic product (GDP) would run somewhat above their individual estimates of its longer -run rate this year and in 2018, while about half of the participants projected that economic growth would slow in 2019 and run at or slightly below their individual longer -run estimates ."
 A substantial majority of participants projected that the unemployment rate would run below their estimates of its longer -run normal level in 2017 and remain below that level through 2019.
" A  large majority of  participants projected that inflation, as measured by the four -quarter p ercentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), would increase over the next two years ; a majority of participants projected that inflation would be at the Committee’s 2  percent objective in 2019, and all participants projected that inflation would be within a couple of  tenths of a percentage point of the objective in that year."
" As shown in figure 2, all but one participant expected that the evolution of economic conditions would likely warrant gradual increases in the federal funds rate to achieve and sustain maximum employment and 2 percent inflation."
"  However, the ec onomic outlook is un certain, and participants noted that their economic projections and assessments of appropriate monetary policy could chang e in response to incoming information."
" Most participants also judged the risks around their projections for economic growth , the unemployment rate, and inflation as broadly balanced, while several participants saw the risks to their forecasts of real GDP growth and inflation as weighted to the upside and several participants viewed the risks to their unemployment rate forecasts as tilted to the downside."
" Figures 4.A, 4.B, and 4.C for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation, respectively, present for the first time  “fan charts” as well as charts of participants’ current qualitative assessments of the uncertainty and risks surrounding the ir economic projections."
" Reflecting in part the uncertainty about the future evolution of GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation, participants’ assessments of appropriate monetary policy are also subject to considerable uncertainty."

"The Outlook for Economic Activity  The median of participants’ projections for the growth rate of real GDP, conditional on their individual assumptions about appropriate monetary policy, was 2.1 percent in 2017  and 2018 and 1.9 percent in 2019; the median of projections for the longer -run normal rate of real GDP growth was 1.8 percent."
" Compared with the December SEP, the medians of the forecasts for real GDP growth over the period from 2017 to 2019 , as well as the median assessment of the longer -run growth rate , were mostly unchanged ."
" As in December, about half of the participants incorporate d expectations of fiscal stimulus into their projections; almost all in this group projected slightly higher real GDP growth next year relative to their December projections ."
"The median of projections for the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of 2017 was 4.5 percent, unchanged from December and 0."
 Alm ost all participants projected that the unemployment rate would not change much over the subsequent two years.

" 4 One participant’s projections for the federal funds rate, real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation were informed by the view that there are multiple possible medium -for 2017 and 2018, while they shifted slightly lower for 2019 and for the longer -run normal rate."
 The Outlook for Inflation  The median s of projections for headline PCE price inflation w ere 1.9 percent in 2017 and  2.0 percent in 2018 and 2019 ; these  medians  were unchanged from December.
" Only a few  participants s aw inflation continuing to run below 2  percent in 2019, while several participants projected that  inflation would run modestly abov e the Committee’s objective  in that year."
" The median s of projections for core inflation w ere 1.9 percent in 2017 and 2.0 percent in 2018 and 2019, very similar to the contour in December ."
 Figures 3.C and 3.D provide information on the distribution s of participants’ views about the outlook for inflation.
" The distributions of projections for headline PCE price inflation were largely unchanged from December, while the distributions for core PCE price inflation shifted up slightly."
 Some participants attribu ted the upward shift in  their project ions for  core inflation to recent data that were somewhat above expectations .
Appropriate Monetary Policy Figure 3.E provides the distribution of participants’ judgments regarding the appropriate target or midpoint of the target range for the federal funds rate at the end of each year from 2017 to 2019 and over the longer run.4  The distri butions for 2017 through 2019 shifted up modestly.
" Under this view, the economy currently is in a regime characterized by expansion of economic activity with low productivity growth and a low shortterm real interest rate, but longer -term outcomes for variables other than inflation cannot be usefully projected."
±1.6 ±2.1 ±2.1 Unemployment rate1 .
 ±0.9 ±1.1 ±1.1 Short -term interest rate s3 .
" As described in the box “Forecast Uncertainty,” under certain assumptions, there is about a 70 percent probability that actual outcomes for real GDP, unemployment, consumer prices, and the federal funds rate will be in ranges implied by the average size of projection errors made in th e past."
" That anticipated pace  reflected a few factors , such as a short -term neutral real interest rate that was currently low and was expected to move up only slowly  as well as  a gradual return of inflation to the Committee’s 2 percent objective ."
 A few participants indicated that positive news on inflation and the continued strengthening of labor market conditions in recent months had in creased their confidence that inflation would move toward or to the 2 percent objective .
 Some participants judged  that a slightly firmer path of monetary policy than in their previous projections  would likely be appropriate .
"Uncertainty and Risks  The economic projections of FOMC participants are generally subject to considerable uncertainty a nd risks,                                                  5 At the end of this summary, the box “Forecast Uncertainty” discusses the sources and interpretation of uncertainty in the economic forecasts and explains the approach used to assess and, in assessing the path of appropriate monetary policy, F OMC participants take account of the range of possible outcomes, the likelihood of their occurring, and the potential benefits and costs to the economy should they occur."
" Table 2 provides one measure of the forecast uncertainty for the change in real GDP, the unemployment rate, and total consumer price inflation— the root mean squared error (RMSE) for forecasts made over the past 20 years."
" This measure of forecast uncertainty is incorporated graphically in the top panels of figures 4.A, 4.B, and 4.C, which  display fan charts plotting the median s of participants’ projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and PCE price inflation surrounded by symmetric confidence intervals derived from the RMSEs presented in table 2."
" Participants’ assessments of the current level of uncertainty surrounding their economic projections are shown in the bottomleft panels of figures 4.A, 4.B, and 4.C.  Most  participants continued to view the uncertainty attached to their economic projections as broadly similar to the average of the past 20 years, with one fewer participant than in December seeing uncertainty abo ut GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and headline inflation as higher than its historical average.5  In the ir discussion of the uncertainty attached to the ir current  projections relative to levels of uncertainty over the past 20 years, as in December , about half of the participants expressed the view that, at this point, uncertainty surrounding prospective changes in fiscal and other policies is very large or that there is not yet enough information to make reasonable assumptions about the timing, nature, and magnitude of the changes."

" Participants’ assessments of the balance of risks to their economic projections are shown in the bottomright panels  of figures 4.A, 4.B, and 4.C.  As in December, most participants judged  the risks to their projections of real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, headline inflation, and core inflation as broadly balanced —in other words,  as broadly consistent  with a symmetric fan chart."
  One more participant saw the risks to unemployment as weighted to the downside than in Dec ember (the bottomright panel of figure 4.B).
"  The balance of risks to the  inflation projection  shifted up slightly relative to December, as one fewer participant  judge d the risks to both headline  and core inflation as weighted to the downside and one more participant  viewed the risks as weighted to the upside  (the lower -right panels of figure 4.C) ."
"  Moreover, a number of participants noted that the possibility of a more expansionary U.S. fiscal policy  might present upside risks to real GDP growth and inflation and downside risks to unemployment."
" Participants’ assessments of the future path of the federal funds rate consistent with appropriate policy are generally subject to considerable uncertainty, re flecting in part uncertainty about the evolution  of GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation over time."
 The fi -nal line in table 2 shows the  RMSEs  for forecasts  of shortterm interest rates.
" These RMSEs  are not strictly consistent with parti cipants’ projections of the federal funds rate, in part because the se assessments are not forecasts of the likeliest outcomes but rather reflect each participant’s individual judgment of appropriate monetary policy."
" However, the associated confidence intervals may provide a sense of the likely uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy that may be appropriate to offset the effects of shocks to the economy."
 This approach to the construction of the federal funds rate fan chart would be merely a convention and would not have any implication for possible future policy decisions regarding the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so were appropriate.
"The conﬁdence interval is not strictly consistent with theprojections for the federal funds rate, primarily because these projections are not forecasts of the likeliest outcomes forthe federal funds rate, but rather projections of participants’ individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy.Still, historical forecast errors provide a broad sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rategenerated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policythat may be appropriate to oﬀset the eﬀects of shocks to the economy.The conﬁdence interval is assumed to be symmetric except when it is truncated at zero—the bottom of the lowesttarget range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted in the past by the Committee."
This truncation wouldnot be intended to indicate the likelihood of the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary policyaccommodation if doing so was judged appropriate.
"Because currentconditions may diﬀer from those that prevailed, on average, over the previous 20 years, the width and shape of theconﬁdence interval estimated on the basis of the historical forecast errors may not reﬂect FOMC participants’ currentassessments of the uncertainty and risks around their projections.* The conﬁdence interval is derived from forecasts of the average level of shortterm interest rates in the fourthquarter of the year indicated; more information about these data is available in table 2."
The shaded area encompassesless than a 70 percent conﬁdence interval if the conﬁdence interval has been truncated at zero.Page 16Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________      Forecast Uncertainty The economic projections provided by the members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks inform discussions of monetary policy among policymakers and can aid public understanding of the basis for policy actions.
" Thus, in setting the stance of monetary policy, participants consider not only what appears to be the most likely economic outcome as embodied in their projections, but also the range of alternative possibilities, the like lihood of their occurring, and the potential costs to the economy should they occur."
" Table 2 summarizes the average historical accuracy of a range of forecasts, including those reported in past Monetary Policy Report s and those prepared by the Federal Reserve Board’s staff in advance of meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee  (FOMC)."
" The corresponding 70  percent confidence intervals for overal l inflation would be 1.1 to 2.9  percent in the current year, and 0.9 to 3.1  percent in the second and third years."
" Figures 4.A through 4.C illustrate these confidence bounds in “fan charts” t hat are symmetric and centered on the median s of FOMC participants’  projections for GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation."
" In particular, the unemployment rate cannot be negative; furthermore, the risks around a particular projection might be tilted to either the upside or the downside, in which case the corresponding fan chart would be asymmetrically positioned around the median projection."
" These judgments are summarized in the lower -right panels of figures 4.A through 4.C.  As with real activity and inflation, the outlook for the future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable uncertainty."
 This uncertaint y arises primarily because each participant ’s assessment of the appropriate stance of monetary policy depends importantly on the evolution of real activity and inflation over time.
 The final line in table  2 shows the error ranges for forecasts of short -term interest rates.
" It should be noted, however, that these confidence intervals are not strictly consistent with the projections for the federal funds rate, as the se projections are not forecasts of the most likely quarter ly outcomes but rather are projections of participants’ individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy and are on an end -ofyear basis."
" However, the forecast errors should provide a sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy that would be appropriate to offset the effects of shocks to the economy."
 This approach to the construction of the federal funds rate fan chart would be  merely a convention; it would  not have any implications for possible future policy decisions regarding the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary polic y accommodation if doing so were appropriate.
