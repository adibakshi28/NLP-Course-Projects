" In China, signs of strain in the property sector increased, and optimism about growth diminished further, on net, although broader markets, including global commodity markets, did not appear to show elevated concern about Chinarelated risks."
"  In addressing the increase in nominal yields on longerrun Treasury securities over the intermeeting period, the manager noted that the rise in  real yields exceeded that of nominal yields over the period, implying a small decline in inflation compensation."
 Inflation expectations appeared to remain very well anchored.
" Still, market particip ants noted that, with household and corporate borrowers having a limited need to refinance debt in the near term, it could take more time for past monetary policy actions to fully pass through to these sectors."
" The labor market continued to be tight, with the unemployment rate low and job gains slowing but remaining strong."
 Consumer price inflation was still elevated.
  The imbalance between labor demand and supply appeared to be easing.
 Total nonfarm payroll employment increased at a slower pace over July and August than in the second quarter.
" Over July and August, the unemployment rate edged up, on net, and stood at 3.8 percent in August, and both the labor force participation rate (LFPR) and the employmentto-population ratio rose slightly."
" The unemployment rate for African Americans declined, while the jobless rate for Hi spanics rose, and both rates were still above the national average."
" The easing of labor market imbalances was also evident in the recent wage data, with the 12month changes in average hourly earnings and the employment cost  index, and the fourquar-ter change in businesssector  comp ensat ion per hour all lower than their yearearlier levels."
Consumer price inflation re mained elevated but continued to show signs of slowing.
"  The total price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) increased 3.3 percent over the 12 months ending in July, and core Minutes of the Meeting of September 19–20, 2023Page 3_____________________________________________________________________________________________ PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in energy prices and many consumer food prices, was 4.2 percent over the same period; both total and core PCE price inflation were lower than a year earlier."
" The trimmed mean measure of 12month PCE price inflation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas was 4.1 percent in July, down from its level earlier in the year."
"In August, the 12month change in the consumer price index (CPI) was 3.7 percent,  while core CPI inflation was 4.3 percent over the same period, and both total and core CPI inflation were well below their yearearlier levels."
 Survey measures of consumers’ shortterm inflation expectations had moved down alongside actual inflation but remained above prepandemic levels.
" In contrast, survey measures of mediumto longerterm inflation expectations remained in the ra nge seen in the decade before the pandemic."
" The nominal U.S. international trade deficit widened, as growth in imports of goods and services outpaced that of exports."
" Foreign economic growth slowed in the second quarter, as troubles in the property sector weighed on economic activity in China and monetary policy restraint contributed to the slowing in econ omic growth in Europe."
"Available data for the third qua rter, such as purchasing managers indexes and measures of business confidence, pointed to a continued subdued pace of economic activity abroad."
Foreign headline inflation continued to fall but remained elevated.
" In the context of stillhigh core inflation, some central banks in advanced foreign economies (AFEs) raised their policy rates, despite a slowdown in economic activity, and indicated their intention to hold these rates at sufficiently restrictive levels to bring inflation back to target rates."
" In contrast, central banks of emerging market economies largely remained on hold, and some even began to cut rates amid easing inflationary pressures."
" Real yields increased almost as much as or a little more than nominal yields, leaving implied measures of inflation compensation modestly changed."
"   Over the i ntermeeting period, the dollar appreciated, as U.S. economic data came in stronger than expected, while foreign data suggested slowing economic growth abroad."
" Interest rates on newly originated bank loans to businesses and households increased over the second quarter, interest rates on credit card offers increased in July, and interest rates on auto loans increased in July and August."
" The staff assumed that GDP growth for the rest of this year would be damped a bit by the autoworkers’ strike, with these effects unwound by a small boost to GDP growth next year."
" In all, the staff projected that real GDP growth in 2024 through 2026 would be slower, on average, than this year and would run below the staff’s estimate of potential output growth, restrained over the next couple of years by the lagged effects of monetary policy actions."
" The unemployment rate was projected to remain roughly flat through 2026, as upward pressure from belowpotential output growth was offset by downward pressure from further improvements in labor market functioning."
"Total and core PCE price inflation were forecast to be around 3.5 percent at the end of this year, and inflation was projected to move lower in coming years, as demand and supply in product and labor markets continued to move into better alignment."
 Total and core PCE price inflation were expected to be close to 2 percent in 2026.
" Risks around the inflation forecast were seen as skewed to the upside, given the possibility that inflation could prove to be more persistent than expected or that further adverse shocks to supply conditions might occur."
" Should these upside inflation risks materialize, the response of monetary policy could, if coupled with an adverse reaction in financial Minutes of the Meeting of September 19–20, 2023Page 5_____________________________________________________________________________________________ markets, tilt the risks arou nd the forecast for economic activity to the downside."
"Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2023 through 2026 and over the longer run."
" The projections were based on their individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy, including the path of the federal funds rate."
" The longerrun projections represented each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy."
" Nevertheless, participants also noted that they expected that real GDP growth would slow in the near term."
 Participants judged that the current stance of monetary policy was restrictive and that it broadly appeared to be restraining the economy as intended.
 Participants stressed that current inflation remained unacceptably high while acknowledging that it had moderated somewhat over the past year.
They also noted that further evidence would be required for them to be confident that inflation was clearly on a path to the Committee’s 2 percent objective.
 Participants continued to view a period of belowtrend growth in real GDP and some soften ing in labor market conditions as likely to be needed to bring aggregate demand and aggregate supply into better balance and reduce inflation pressures sufficiently to  return inflation to 2 percent over time.
" However, ma ny participants remarked that the finances of some households were coming under pressure amid high inflation and declining savings and that there had been an increasing reliance on credit to finance expenditures."
" In addition, tighter credit conditions, waning fiscal support for families, and a resumption of student loan payments were viewed by several participants as having the potential to weigh on the growth of consumption."
" Some participants noted that housing demand was resilient despite higher interest rates; new home construction was solid, in part reflecting the limited inventory of homes available for sale."
" Several participants judged that, over coming quarters, business activity would be restrained by tighter financial conditions, such as higher interest rates and more constrained access to bank credit."
" With respect to the agricultural sector, a few participants noted that conditions were mixed, as crop prices had declined amid higher production estimates and as supply and demand imbalances pushed up the prices of some types of livestock and held down the prices of others."
  Participants observed that the labor market was tight but that supply and demand conditions were continuing to come into better balance.
" Most participants remarked that a range of indicators of labor demand were easing—as could be seen by declines in job openings, a narrowing of the jobsto-workers gap, lower quits rates, and a reduction in average weekly hours worked to levels at or below those seen before the pandemic."
 Some participants observed that payroll growth remained strong but had slowed in recent months to a pace closer to that consistent with maintaining a constant unemployment rate over time.
" They noted, however, that nominal wages were still rising at rates above leve ls generally assessed to be consistent with the sustained achievement of the Committee’s 2 percent inflation objective, given current estimates of trend productivity growth."
Participants noted that the data received over the past several months generally su ggested that inflation was slowing.
" Even with these favorable developments, they emphasized that further progress was needed to get inflation sustainably to 2 percent."
 Participants pointed to the softening of price inflation for goods amid improving supply conditions and to declining housing services inflation.
" Several participants remarked that, despite the recent rise in energy prices, food and energy prices over the past year had contributed to a decline in overall inflation."
" However, participants also noted that significant progress in reducing inflation had yet to become apparent in the prices of core services excluding housing."
 Participants noted that longerterm inflation expectations remained well anchored and that shorterterm inflation expectations had been moving down from elevated levels.
" Participants observed that, notwithstanding recent favorable developments, inflation remained well above the Committee’s 2 percent longerrun objective and that elevated inflation was continuing to harm businesses and households—particularly lowincome households."
 Participants stressed that they would need to see more data indicating that inflation pressures were abating to be more confident that inflation was on course to return to 2 percent over time.
" One new source of uncertainty was that associated with the autoworkers’ strike, and many participants observed that an intensification of the strike posed both an upside risk to inflation and a downside risk to activity."
 A majority of participants pointed to upside risks to inflation from rising energy prices that could undo some of the recent disinflation or to the risk that inflation would prove more persistent than expect ed.
" Various participants noted downside risks to economic activity, including that credit conditions might tighten more than expected if the domestic banking sector experienced further strains; the possibility that the economic slowdown in China could result in a drag on global economic growth; or that an extended U.S. government shutdown could have negative, albeit temporary, consequences for growth."
 Some participants remarked that an upside risk to their projections for economic activity was that the unexpected resilience that  the economy had demonstrated so far could persist.
"  In their consideration of appropriate monetary policy actions at this meeting, participants concurred that economic activity had been expanding at a solid pace and had been resilient."
" While the labor market remained tight, job gains had slowed, and there were continuing signs that supply and demand in the labor market were coming into better balance."
" Participants also noted that tighter credit conditions facing households and businesses were a source of headwinds for the economy and would likely weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation."
" Although inflation had moderated since the middle of last year, it remained well above the Committee’s longerrun goal of 2 percent, and participants remained resolute in their commitment to bring inflation down to the Committee’s 2 percent objective."
" Amid these economic conditions, and in consideration of the significant cumulative tightening in the stance of monetary policy and the lags with which policy affects economic activity and inflation, almost all participants judged it appropriate to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5¼ to 5½ percent at this meeting."
" In discussing the policy outlook, participants continued to judge th at it was critical that the stance of monetary policy be kept sufficiently re strictive to return inflation Minutes of the Meeting of September 19–20, 2023Page 7_____________________________________________________________________________________________ to the Committee’s 2 percent objective over time."
 Participants expected that the data arriving in coming months would help clarify the extent to which the disinflation process was continuing and labor markets were reaching a better balance between demand and supply.
 This information would be valuable in determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time.
 Some participants also emphasized the importance of continuing to communicate clearly to the public about the Committee’s datadependent approach to policy and its firm commitment to bring inflation down to 2 percent.
 All participants agreed that policy should remain restrictive for some time until the Committee is confident that inflation is moving down sustainably toward its objective.
 A few participants noted that the pace at which inflation was returning to the Committee’s 2 percent goal would influence their views of the sufficiently restrictive level of the policy rate and how long to keep policy restrictive.
" Several participants commented that, with the policy rate likely at or near its peak, the focus of monetary policy decisions and communications should shift from how high to raise the policy rate to how long to hold the policy rate at restrictive levels."
 A few participants noted that it would be important to monitor the real federal funds rate in ga uging the stance of monetary policy over time.
" Most participants observed that postmeeting communications, including the SEP, would help clarify to the public how participants assessed the likely evolution of the stance of monetary policy."
" Participants generally judged that, with the stance of monetary policy in restrictive terr itory, risks to the achievement of the Committee’s goals had become more two sided."
" But with inflation still well above the Committee’s longerrun goal and the labor market remaining tight, most participants continued to  see upside risks to inflation."
" These risks included the imbalance of aggregate demand and supply persisting longer than expected, as well as risks emanating from global oil markets, the potential for upside shocks to food prices, the effects of a strong housing market on shelter inflation, and the potential for more limited declin es in goods prices."
" Many participants commented that even though economic activity had been resilient an d the labor market had remained strong, there continue d to be downside risks to economic activity and upside risks to the unemployment rate."
" Such risks included largerthan-anticipated lagged macroeconomic effects from the tightening in financial conditions, the effect of labor union strikes, slowing global growth, and continued weakness in the CRE sector."
"Committee Policy Actions In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that economic activity had been expanding at a solid pace, and, accordingly, that the corresponding language in the postmeeting statement should be changed from “moderate” to “solid.”  They also concurred that job gains had slowed in recent months but remained strong, and the unemployment rate had remained low."
 Inflation had remained elevated.
" They also agreed that ti ghter credit conditions for households and businesses were likely to weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation but that the e xtent of these effects was uncertain."
 Members also concurred that they remained highly attentive to inflation risks.
"In support of the Committee’s objectives to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run, members agreed to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5¼ to 5½ percent."
 They also agreed that they would continue to assess additional information and its implications for monetary policy.
" In determining the extent of additional Page 8Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ policy firming that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time, members concurred that they would take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments."
 All members affirmed that they are strongly committed to returning inflation to their 2 percent objective.
"Members agreed that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook."
 They would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals.
" Members also agreed that their assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments."
