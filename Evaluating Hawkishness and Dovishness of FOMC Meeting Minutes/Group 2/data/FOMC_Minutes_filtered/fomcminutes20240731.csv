" Financial conditions eased modestly over the intermeeting period, reflecting lower longterm interest rates and higher equity prices."
 The manager noted that current financial conditions appeared to be providing neither a headwind nor tailwind to growth.
" Treasury yields remained sensitive to surprises in economic data, particularly consum er price index releases and employment reports."
" While nearterm inflation compen sation fell over the intermeeting period, longerterm forward measures were little changed."
"  In the equity markets, the high perceived likelih ood of a September cut in the target range for the policy rate induced a notable appreciation in the stoc ks of firms with small and medium capitalization, which tend to be more sensitive to interest rates."
"2    Jul y 30–31, 2024  Expectations for policy rates in most advanced fo reign economies (AFEs) de clined, as recent data generally pointed to continued prog ress on inflation."
" The effective federal funds rate remained unchanged over the intermeeting period, but the manager noted that rates on repurchase agreements (repo)  had edged higher, reflecting increased demand for financing Treasury securities as well as the expected  effects of gradual balance sheet normalization."
"Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information available at the time of the meet ing indicated that U.S. economic activity had advanced solidly so far this year, but at a markedly  slower pace than in the second half of 2023."
" Labor market conditions continued to ease:  Jo b gains moderated, and the unemployment rate moved up further but remained low."
 Consumer price inflation was well below its yearearlier pace but remained somewhat elevated.
"Consumer price inflation—as meas ured by the 12month change in  the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE)—was about the same in June as it was at the start of the year, though the monthover-month changes in May and June were  smaller than those seen earlier in the year."
" Total PCE price inflation was 2.5 percent in June , and core PCE price inflation—which excludes changes in energy prices and many consumer food prices—was 2.6 percent."
" The unemployment rate mo ved up further in June to 4.1 percent; the labor force participation rate ticked up as well, and the employmentto-population ratio was unchanged."
" The unemployment rate for African Americans rose in June, while the rate for Hispanics declined slightly; both rates were above that for Whites."
" Th e ratio of job vacancies to unemployment remained at 1.2 in June, about the same as its prepandemic  level."
" Measures of nominal wages continued to decelerate:  Average hourly earnings for all employee s rose 3.9 percent over the 12 months ending in June, down 0.8 percentage point relative to a year earlier, and the 12month change in the employment cost index of hourly compensation of private industry workers was 3.9 percent in June, down 0.6 percentage point fr om its yearearlier pace."
" Over th e first half of the year, GDP growth was noticeably slower than its average pace in 2023."
"As in the first quarter, net exports subtracted from U.S. GDP growth in the second quarter."
" Growth in real exports of goods and services remained tepid overall, as gains in exports of capital goods and consumer goods were partly offset by declines in ex ports of foods and industrial supplies."
" Foreign economic growth was estimate d to have been subdued in the second quarter, held down by a sharp deceleration in economic ac tivity in China amid ongoing prop ertysector woes."
" In Europe and Latin America, output likely expanded below its tren d pace, as restrictive monetary policy continued to be a drag on activity."
  Recent global inflation developments  were mixed.
" In the AFEs, head line inflation edged down in the second quarter but generally remained above target le vels."
" In emerging market economies, headline inflation rose a touch overall, reflec ting, in part, runups in food prices in some countries."
" The Bank of Canada and the Swiss National Bank  cut their policy rates further, in part citing easing inflation pressures."
 Options on interest rate futures suggested that market participants were placing higher odds on a larger policy easing by early 2025 than they did just before the June meeting.
" Interest rates on new credit card offers increased slightly, while rates on new auto lo ans were little changed."
 Interest rates on small business loans remained elevated.
" In the July Senior Loan Office r Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS), Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee    5  banks reported modestly tighter standards and le nding terms for commercial  and industrial (C&I) loans, on net, while reported demand for C&I loan s remained about unchanged."
"Credit remained available for most consumers ov er the intermeeting period, though credit growth showed signs of moderating."
" Although banks reported in the SLOOS that lending standard s on auto loans were unchanged in  the second quarter, growth in auto lending at both banks and nonbanks contracted further."
 The staff’s outlook for growth in the second half of 2 024 had been marked down largely in response to weakerthan-expected labor market indicators.
" Over 2025 and 2026, real GDP growth was expected to rise about in line with potential, leaving the output gap roughly flat in those years."
 The unemployment rate was ex pected to edge up slightly over the remainder of 2024 and then to remain roughly unchanged in 2025 and 2026.
"The staff’s inflation forecast was slightly lower than the one prepared for the previous meeting, reflecting incoming data and the lower projected level of resource utilization."
" Both total and core PCE price inflation were expected to decline further as demand and su pply in product and labor markets continued to move into better balance; by 2026, tota l and core inflation were expected to be around 2 percent."
" Risks to the inflation forecast we re still seen as tilted to the upside, albeit to a smaller degree than at the time of the previous meetin g."
" The risks around the forecast for real activity were viewed as skewed to the downside, both becaus e morepersistent inflation could result in tighter financial conditions than in the ba seline and because the recent soft ening in some indicators of labor market conditions might be pointing to a largerthan-anticipated slowdown in aggregate demand growth."
"Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee    7  Participants’ Views on Current Cond itions and the Economic Outlook Participants observed that inflation had eased over the past year but remained elevated and that, in recent months, there had been so me further progress toward the Committee’s 2 percent inflation objective."
 Participants noted that the recent pr ogress on disinflation was broad based across the major subcomponents of core inflat ion.
" Price inflation in June for housing services showed a notable slowing, which part icipants had been anticipating for some time."
"    With regard to the outlook for in flation, participants judged that  recent data had increased their confidence that inflation was moving  sustainably toward 2 percent."
 Almost all participants observed that the factors that had contribu ted to recent disinflation would likely continue to put downward pressure on inflation in coming months.
" These fact ors included a continued wa ning of pricing power, moderating economic growth, and the runoff in ex cess household savings accumulated during the pandemic."
" Many participants noted that the modera tion of growth in labor costs as labor market conditions rebalanced would continue  to contribute to disinflation, particularly in core nonhousing services prices."
 Some participants noted that th e lags in the time it takes for housing rental conditions for new tenants to show through to aggre gate price data for housing services meant that the disinflationary trend in this component would li kely continue.
 Participants also observed that longerterm inflation expectatio ns had remained well anchored and viewed this anchoring as underpinning the disinflation process.
" A couple of  participants noted that inflation pressures might persist for some time, as they assessed that the economy had considerab le momentum, and that, even with some easing of the demand for labor, the labor market remained strong."
Participants assessed that supply and demand cond itions in the labor mark et had continued to come into better balance.
" However, many participants noted that reported payroll gains migh t be overstated, and several assessed that payroll gains may be lower than those needed to keep the un employment rate constant with a flat labor force participation rate."
" Participants noted that, with continued rebalancing of labor market conditions, nominal wage growth had continued to moderate."
"Participants noted that real GDP growth was solid in the first half of the year , though slower than the robust pace seen in the second half of last year."
" PDFP growth, which usually gives a better signal than GDP growth of economic momentum, also moderated in  the first half, but by less than GDP growth."
 Participants viewed the moderation in the growth of economic  activity to be largely in line with what they had anticipated.
"Regarding the household sector, participants observed  that consumer spending had slowed from last year’s robust pace, consistent with restrictive mone tary policy, easing of labor market conditions, and slowing income growth."
" Upside risks to the inflation outlook were seen as ha ving diminished, while downside risks to employment were seen as having increased."
" Participants saw risks to achi eving the inflation and employment objectives as continuing to move into better balance, with a couple  noting that they viewed these risks as more or less balanced."
" As sources of upside risks to inflation, some participants cited the potential for disruptions to supply chains and a further deterioration in geopolitical conditions."
 A few participants noted that an easing of financial conditions could boost economic activi ty and present an upside risk to economic growth and inflation.
"In their consideration of monetary po licy at this meeting, participants  observed that recent indicators suggested that economic activity had continued to expand at a solid pace, job gains had moderated, and the unemployment rate had moved up but rema ined low."
" While inflation remained somewhat above the Committee’s longerrun goal of 2 percent, participants noted that inflation had eased over the past year and that recent incoming data indi cated some further progress toward the Committee’s objective."
" All participants support ed maintaining the target range for the federal funds rate at 5¼ to 5½ percent, although several observed that the re cent progress on inflation and increases in the unemployment rate had provided a plausible case for reducing the target range 25 basis points at this meeting or that they could have supported such a decision."
"In discussing the outlook for moneta ry policy, participants noted that  growth in economic activity had been solid, there had been some further progress on  inflation, and conditions in the labor market had eased."
" Almost all participants remarked that while the incoming data regarding inflation were encouraging, additional informat ion was needed to provide greate r confidence that inflation was moving sustainably toward the Committee’s 2 percen t objective before it would be appropriate to lower the target range for the federal funds rate."
" Ne vertheless, participants vi ewed the incoming data as enhancing their confidence that inflation was mo ving toward the Committee’s objective."
" Many participants commente d that monetary policy continued to be restrictive, although they expressed a range of views about the degree of restrictiveness, and a few participants noted that on going disinflation, with no change in the nominal target range for the policy rate, by itself results in a tightening in monetary policy."
" Most participants remarked on the importance of  communicating the Committee’s datadependent approach and emphasized, in particular, that monetary policy decisions are conditional on the evolution of the economy rather than being on a preset path or that those decisions depend on the totality of the incoming data rather than on any particular data point."
 Several participan ts stressed the need to monitor conditions in money markets and factors af fecting the demand for reserves amid the ongoing reduction in the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet.
"Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee    11  In discussing riskmanagement cons iderations that could bear on the outlook for monetary policy, participants highlighted uncertainties affecting th e outlook, such as those regarding the amount of restraint currently provided by monetary policy, th e lags with which past and current restraint have affected and will affect economic activity, and the degree of normalization of the economy following disruptions associated with the pandemic."
" A majority  of participants remarked that the risks to the employment goal had increased, and many participan ts noted that the risks to the inflation goal had decreased."
 Ma ny participants noted that reducing policy restraint too late or too little could risk unduly weakenin g economic activity or employment.
 Several participants remarked th at reducing policy restraint too soon or too much could risk a resurgence in aggregate demand and a reversal of the progress on inflation.
 These participants pointed to risks related to potential shoc ks that could put upward pressure on inflation or the possibility that inflation could prove mo re persistent than currently expected.
