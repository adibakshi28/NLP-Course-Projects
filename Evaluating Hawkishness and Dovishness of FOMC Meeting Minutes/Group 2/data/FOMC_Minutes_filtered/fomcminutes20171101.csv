 Money market interest rates suggested that market par ticipants did not anticipate a change in the Committee’s target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting but saw a high probability of a 25  basis point increase at the Committee’s December meeting.
" Although the effects of the recent hurricanes led to a reported decline in payroll employment in September, the unemployment rate decreased further."
" Retail gasoline prices jumped in the aftermath of the hurricanes, but total consumer price inflation, as measured by the 12month percent age change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), remained below 2 percent  in September and was lower than early in the year."
 Survey -based measures of longer -run inflation expectations were little changed on balance.
" Total nonfarm payroll employment was reported to have decreased in September, consistent with a substantial increase in the number of people who reported themselves as being absent from work due to bad weather and with payroll declines in the hurricane -affected states of Texas Page 2                                                                                                                                                                              _Federal Open Market Committee  and Florida."
" However, the national unemployment rate moved down to 4.2  percent  in September, and the labor force participation rate rose."
" The unemployment rates for African Americans, for Hispanics, and for whites were lower in September than around the start of the year, while the rate for Asians was roughly flat this year; the unemployment rates for each of these groups were close to the levels seen just before  the most recent  recession."
 The four -week moving average of initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits moved back down to a low level by late October after rising in September following the hurricanes.
 Recent readings showed a modest pickup in growth of labor compensation.
" The employment cost index for private workers increased 2½  percent  over the 12  months ending in September, a little faster than in the 12 -month period ending a year earlier."
" Real PCE growth slowed in the third quarter, likely reflecting in part temporary effects of the hurricanes."
" The nominal U.S. international trade deficit narrowed in August, as exports rose and imports fell."
" Export growth was driven by higher exports of capital goods and consumer goods , while the import decline was led by low er imports of industrial supplies and capital goods."
" Advance estimates for September suggested that goods imports grew more than exports, pointing to a widening of the monthly trade deficit."
" Despite this widening, net exports were reported to have contri buted positively to real GDP growth for the third quarter as a whole."
" Core PCE price inflation, which excludes cha nges in consumer food and energy prices, was about 1¼  percent  over that same period."
" The consumer price index (CPI) rose 2¼  percent  over the 12 months ending in September, while core CPI inflation was 1¾  percent ."
" Recent readings on survey -based measures of longer -run inflation expectations —including those from the Michigan survey, the Blue Chip Economic Indicators, and the Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants —were little changed on balance."
 Foreign economic activity continued to expand at a solid pace.
" Incoming data suggested that in most advanced Minutes of the Meeting of October 31–November 1, 2017_                                                                                                                                                                              Page 3  foreign economies (AFEs), economic growth slowed in the third quarter but remained firm."
" Economic activity in the emerging market economies (EMEs) also continued to grow briskly  for the most part, especially in Asia."
" The Mexican economy, however, contracted in the third quarter, in part because hurricanes and earthquakes disrupted economic activity."
" Headline inflation in the AFEs generally remained subdued, but U.K. inflation stayed  above the Bank of England’s 2  percent  target."
" Low inflation persisted in most EMEs as well, al though  rising food prices continued to put upward pressure on inflation in Mexico."
" In addition, market commentaries observed that, despite low inflation readings in recent months, the characterization of  the inflation outlook in the September policy statement was little changed and the SEP showed only modest downward revisions to FOMC participants’ near -term inflation projections."
 Measures of inflation compensation based on Treasury Inflation -Protected Securities declined somewhat following the slightly lower -thanexpected September CPI data but were little changed on net.
" Meanwhile, growth of banks’ commercial and industrial (C&I) loans continued to be sluggish, although it picked up a bit in the third quarter."
 Responses to the October Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS) suggested that lackluster demand among banks’ business customers was a key factor in this subdued growth.
" Meanwhile, CRE loan growth at banks slowed, especially for nonfarm nonresidential loans."
" In the October SLOOS, banks reported that demand for CRE loans weakened, on n et, over the third quarter and that lending standards continued to be somewhat tight."
 The October SLOOS suggested that the recent slowdown in mortgage originations for home purchases was partly attributable to weaker demand.
"  The broad index of the foreign exchange value of the dollar rose nearly 3 percent over the intermeeting period amid the rise in U.S. interest rates, market expe ctations that U.S. tax reform was becoming more likely , and foreign central bank actions and communications."
 Payroll employment was also expected to rebound during the fourth quarter.
" Beyond 2017, the forecast for real GDP growth was essentially unrevised."
 The unemployment rate was projected to decline gradually over the next couple of years and to continue running below the staff’s estimate of its longer -run natural rate over this period.
" The staff’s forecast for total PCE price inflation was little changed for 2017, as a somewhat higher forecast for Minutes of the Meeting of October 31–November 1, 2017_                                                                                                                                                                              Page 5  consumer energy prices was mostly offset by a slightly lower forecast for core PCE prices."
" Al though total PCE price inflation was forecast to be about the same in 2017 as it was last year, core PCE price inflation was anticipated to be a little lower than in 2016 , and consumer food and energy price inflation was expected to be a little higher."
" Total PCE price inflation was projected to pick up in 2018, as most of the softness in core PCE price inflation this year was expected to be transitory."
" However, the staff’s forecasts for core inflation and , thus, for total inflation were revised down slightly for next year, reflecting the judgment that a bit of the unexplained weakness in core inflation this year may carry over into next year."
" Beyond 2018, the inflation forecast was unchanged from the previous projection."
 The staff continued to project that inflation would reach the Committee’s 2  percent  objective in 2019.
"The staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as similar to the average of the past 20 years."
 The staff saw the risks to the forecasts for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate as balanced.
 The risks to the projection for inflation also were seen as balanced.
 Downside risks included the possibilities that longer -term inflation expectations may have edged lower or that the run of soft readings on core inflation this year could prove to be more persistent than the staff expected.
 These downside risks were seen as essentially counterbalanced by the upside risk that inflation could increase more than expected in an economy that was projected to move further above it s longer -run potential.
" Participants ’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook  In their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants agreed that information received since the FOMC met in September indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising at a solid rate despite hurricane -related disruptions."
" Al though the hurricanes  depressed payroll employment in September, the unemployment rate, which was less affecte d by the storms, declined further."
" Household spending had been expanding at a moderate rate, and growth in business fixed investment had picked up in recent quarters."
" Gasoline prices rose in the aftermath of the hurricanes, boosting overall inflation in September; however, inflation for items other than food and energy remained soft."
" On a 12 -month basis, both inflation measures had declined this year and were running below 2  percent ."
"  Market -based measures of inflation compensation remained low; survey -based measures of longer -term inflation expectations were little changed, on balance."
" Participants acknowledged that hurricane -related disruptions and rebuilding would continue to affect economic activity in the near term, and they noted that, in October, wildfires  in California  had displaced many households."
" Participants saw the incoming information on spending and the labor market as consistent with continued above -trend economic growth and a further strengthening in labor market conditions, al though  the hurricanes , in particular , made it more difficult than usual to interpret some of this information."
" They continued to expect that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity would expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions would strengthen  somewhat further."
 Inflation on a 12month basis was expected to remain somewhat below 2  percent  in the near term but to stabilize around the Committee’s 2  percent  objective over the medium term.
" Near -term risks to the economic outlook appeared to be roughly balanced, but participants agreed that it would be important to continue to monitor inflation developments closely."
" Participants expected solid  growth in consumer spending in the near term, supported by ongoing strength in the labor market, improved household balance sheets, and a high level of consumer sentiment."
" Light motor vehicle sales had rebounded in September , and District contacts generally expected sales to remain strong in the near term, boosted in part by demand to replace vehicles destroyed by the hurricanes ."
" Improved demand from abroad, rising business profits, and the substitution of capital for labor in response to tightening  labor markets were viewed as factors supporting growth in investment."
" Participants judged that increases in nonfarm payroll employment, apart from the temporary effects of the hurricanes,  remained well above the pace likely to be sustainable in the longer run and that labor market conditions had strengthened further in rece nt months."
" Data from the household survey, which generally were viewed as not materially affected by the hurricanes, indicated that the unemployment rate ticked down to 4.2  percent  in September, falling further below participants’ estimates of its  longer -run normal level."
" Many participants judged that the economy was operating at or above full employment and anticipated that the labor market would tighten somewhat further in the nea r term, as GDP was expected to grow at a pace exceeding that of potential output."
" A few participants interpreted recent data on aggregate wage a nd labor compensation as indicating some firming in wage growth; a few others, however, judged wage growth to have been little changed over the past year."
" A couple of participants expressed the view that, when the rate of labor productivity growth was taken into account, the pace of recent wage gains  was consistent with an economy operating near full employment."
" Gasoline prices rose in the aftermath of the hurricanes, boosting overall inflation in September."
" Still, on  a 12month basis, PCE price inflation in September , at 1.6 percent , remain ed below the Committee’s longer -run objective; core PCE price inflation, which excludes consumer food and energy prices, was only 1.3  percent ."
 Many participants judge d that much of the  recent softness in core inflation reflected temporary or idiosyncratic factors and that inflation would begin to rise once the influence of these factors began to wane.
 Most participants continued to think that the cyclical pressures associated with a ti ghtening labor market were likely to show through to higher inflation over the medium term.
" With core inflation readings continuing to surprise on the downside, however, many participants observed that there was some likelihood that inflation might remain below 2  percent  for longer than they currently expected, and they discussed possible reasons for the recent shortfall."
" Several participants pointed to a diminished responsiveness of inflation to resource utilization, to the possibility that the degree of labor market tightness was less than currently estimated , or to lags in the response  of inflation to g reater resource utilization as plausible explanations for the continued soft readings on inflation ."
" A few noted that secular influences, such as the effe ct of technological innovation in disrupting existing business models, were likely offsetting cyclical upward pressure on inflation and contributing to below -target inflation."
"  In discussing the implications of these developments, several participants expressed concern that the persistently weak inflation data could lead to a decline in longer -term inflation expectations or may have done so already; they pointed to low marketbased measures of inflation compensation, declines in some survey measures of inf lation expectations,  or evidence from statistical models suggesting that the underlying trend in inMinutes of the Meeting of October 31–November 1, 2017_                                                                                                                                                                              Page 7  flation had fallen in recent years ."
" In addition , the possibility was raised that monetary policy actions or communications over the past couple of years, while inflation was below the Committee’s 2  percent  objective , may have contributed to a decline in longer -run inflation expectations below a level consistent with that objective."
" Some other participants, however, noted that measures of inflation expectations had remained stable this year despite the low readings on  inflation and judged that this stability should support the return of inflation to the Committee’s objective."
" In their discussion of monetary policy, all participants thought that it would be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate at this m eeting."
 Nearly all participants reaffirmed the view that a gradual approach to increasing the target range was likely to promote the Committee’s objectives of maximum employment and price stability.
" Most saw the outlook for economic activity and the labor market as little changed since the September meeting, and participants expected increasing tightness in the labor market to put only gradual upward pressure on inflation."
" Still, with an accommodativ e stance of policy, most participants continued to anticipate that inflation would stabilize around the Committee’s 2  percent objective over the medium term."
"  Many participants observed , however,  that continued low readings on inflation, which had occurre d even as the labor market tightened, might reflect not only transitory factors , but also the influence of developments that could prove more persistent."
 A number of these participants were worried that a decline in longer -term inflation expectations would make it more challenging for the Committee to promote a return of inflation to 2 percent  over the medium term.
" These participants’ concerns were sharpened by the apparently weak responsiveness of inflation to resource utilization and the low level of th e neutral interest rate, and such considerations suggested that the removal of policy accommodation should be quite gradual."
" In contrast, some other participants were concerned about upside risks to inflation in an environment in which the economy had reached full employment and the labor market was projected to tighten further, or about still very accommodative financial conditions."
" They cautioned that waiting too long to remove accommodation, or removing accommodation too slowly , could result in a  substantial  overshoot of the maximum sustainable level of employment that would likely be costly to reverse or could lead to increased risks to financial stability."
 A few of these participants emphasized that the lags in the response of inflation to tigh tening resource utilization implied that there could be increasing upside risks to inflation as the labor market tightened further.
" Consistent with the ir expectation that a gradual removal of monetary policy accommodation would be appropriate, many participants thought that another increase in the target range for the federal funds rate was likely to be warranted in the near term if incoming information left the mediumterm outlook broadly unchanged."
 Several participants indicated that their decision about whether to increase the target range in the near term would depend importantly on whether the upcoming economic data boosted their confidence that inflation was headed toward the Committee’s objective.
 A few other participants thought that additional policy firming should be deferred until incoming information confirmed that inflation was clearly on a path toward the Page 8                                                                                                                                                                              _Federal Open Market Committee  Committee’s symmetric 2  percent  objective.
 A few participants cautioned that further increases in the target range for t he federal funds rate while inflation remained persistently below 2  percent  could unduly depress inflation expectations or lead the public to question the Committee’s commitment to its longer -run inflation objective.
"  In view of the persistent shortfall o f inflation from the Committee’s 2  percent  objective and questions about whether longerterm inflation expectations were consistent with achievement of that objective, a couple of participants discussed the possibility that potential alternative frameworks  for the conduct of monetary policy could be helpful  in fulfilling the Committee’s statutory mandate."
" One  question , for example,  was whether a framework that generally sought to keep the price level close to a gradually rising path —rather than the current approach in which the Committee does not seek to make up for past deviations of inflation from the 2 percent goal—might be more effective in fostering the Committee’s objectives if the neutral level of the federal funds rate remains  low."
"   Committee Policy Action  In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that  information received since the Committee met in September indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising at a solid rate despite hurricane- related disruptions."
" Although the hurricanes depressed payroll employment in September, the unemployment rate declined further."
" Household spending had been expanding at a moderate rate, and growth in business fixed investment had picked up in recent quarters."
" Gasoline prices rose in the aftermath of the hurricanes, boosting overall inflation in September; however, inflation for items other than food and energy remained soft."
" On a 12 -month basis, both inflation measures had declined this year and were running below 2  percent ."
" Market -based measures of inflation compensation remained low; survey -based measures of longer -term inflation expectations were little changed, on balance."
" Members acknowledged that hurricane -related disruptions and rebuilding would continue to affect economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term."
" Consequently, the Committee continued to expect that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity would expand at a moderate pace, and labor  market conditions would strengthen somewhat further."
 Inflation on a 12 -month basis was expected to remain somewhat below 2  percent  in the near term but to stabilize around the Committee’s 2 percent  objective over the medium term.
" Members saw the near -term risks to the economic outlook as roughly balanced, but, in light of their concern about the ongoing softness in inflation, they agreed to continue to monitor inflation developments closely."
" After assessing current conditions and the outlook for economic  activity, the labor market, and inflation, members decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1 to 1 ¼ percent ."
" They noted that the stance of monetary policy remained accommodative, thereby supporting some further strengthening in labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2  percent  inflation."
 Members agreed that the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate would depend on their assessments of realized and expected economic conditions relative to the Committee’s objectives of maximum employment and 2  percent  inflation.
" They noted that their assessments would take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
" In particular, members noted that they would carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to the Committee’s symmetric inflation goal."
" Some members expressed concerns about the outlook for inflation expectations and inflation; they emphasized that, in considering the timing of further adjustments in the federal funds rate, they would be evaluating incoming information to assess the likelihood that recent low readings on inflation were transitory and that inflation was on a traje ctory consistent with achieving the Committee’s 2 percent  objective over the medium term."
" Several other members, however, were reasonably confident that the economy and inflation would evolve in coming months such that an additional firming would likely b e appropriate in the near term."

 The Committee also directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve ’s agency mortgage -backed securities transactions.”  The vote  also encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00  p.m.: “Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in September indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising at a solid rate despite hurricane -related disruptions.
