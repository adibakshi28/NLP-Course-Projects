  Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information reviewed at the April 30–May 1 meeting indicated that economic activity expanded at a moderate pace in the first quarter.
" In March, the unemployment rate edged down further, although it continued to be elevated, and employment growth slowed."
" Consumer price inflation was relatively low, while measures of longerrun inflation expectations remained stable."
"After faster gains in January and February, private nonfarm employment increased at a subdued rate in March, and government employment declined slightly."
" The unemployment rate was 7.6 percent in March, a little below its average in the fourth quarter of last year."
" The rate of longduration unemployment and the share of workers employed part time for economic reasons declined somewhat in March, but these measures remained well above their prerecession levels."
" Indicators of nearterm labor market conditions were consistent with projections of moderate increases in employment in the coming months:  Measures of job openings generally moved up, but the rate of gross privatesector hiring and indicators of firms’ hiring plans were subdued, on balance, and initial claims for unem ployment insurance trended up a little over the intermeeting period."
Growth in real business expenditures on equipment and software slowed in the first quarter.
"    The advance release of firstquarter data for the national income and product accounts showed that real net exports of goods and servi ces also subtracted moderately from real gross domestic product (GDP) growth, as real imports outpaced real exports."
" Nearterm inflation expectations from the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers were slightly lower in April, and longerterm inflation expect ations in the survey were little changed and remained within the narrow range that they have occupied for several years."
 Increases in the employment cost index were modest over the year ending in the first quarter.
       Economic growth in foreig n economies overall in the first quarter of 2013 showed  only a small improvement from that registered in the second half of 2012.
" Real GDP growth picked up in the United Kingdom, and recent indicators suggested that the pace of contraction moderated in the euro area."
" In contrast, economic growth in China slowed abruptly after surging late last year."
" Foreign inflation appeared to increase a little in the first quarter, partly as a result of higher food prices in several emerging market economies, but remained quite moderate."
"Over the intermeeting period, nearterm measures of inflation compensation derived from yields on nominal and inflationprotected Treasury securities moved lower amid somewhat disappointing economic data and declines in energy and other commodity prices; forward measures of inflation comp ensation changed little at longer horizons."
"Broad equity price indexes increased, on net, over the intermeeting period, likely reflecting solid quarterly earnings reports, stable me diumterm earnings expectations, and lower interest rate s."
" Syndicated leveraged loans were  issued at a record pace in the first quarter, supported by strong demand for this type of asset, particularly from nonbank institutions."
" According to the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS) conducted in April, the fraction of banks that eased standards on CRE loans over the past three months increased to a relatively high level, while demand for these loans strengthened further."
 Growth was pa rticularly strong in auto loans as well as in student loans extended through the Department of Education’s Direct Loan Program.
" By contrast, stock prices in Japan rose sharply, as the Bank of Japan surpri sed investors with the scale of its new monetary policy program aimed at raising inflation to 2 percent."
"Staff Economic Outlook  In the economic forecast prepared by the staff for the April 30–May 1 FOMC meeting, the projection for real GDP growth was little revised from that prepared for the March meeting."
" With fiscal policy expected to be tighter this year than last year, the staff still anticipated that the pace of expansion in real GDP would only somewhat exceed the growth rate of potential output in 2013."
" The staff also contin ued to project that real GDP would accelerate gr adually in 2014 and 2015, supported by an eventual easing in the effects of fiscal policy restraint on economic growth, increases in consumer and business sentiment, further improvements in credit availability and financial conditions, and accommodative monetary policy."
" The expansion in economic activity was anticipated to slowly reduce the slack in labor and product markets over the projection period, and the unemployment rate was expected to decline gradually."
" With longerrun inflation expectations assumed to remain st able, energy prices expected to continue to trend down, and significant resource slack persisting over the forecast period, the staff continued to project that inflation would remain subdued through 2015."
The staff viewed the uncertainty around its forecast for economic activity as similar to the average level over the past 20 years.
" Although the staff saw the outlook for inflation as uncertain, the risks were viewed as balanc ed and not unusually high."
" Conditions in the labor market showed some continued improvement, although the unemployment rate remained elevated."
" However, growth in business investment spending slowed somewhat, and fiscal policy appeared to be exerting significant nearterm restraint on the economy."
" Perhaps reflecting more subdued growth abroad, especially in Europe and China,  net exports weakened in the first quarter."
" Various views on this prospect were offered, from those participants who put more emphasis on the underlying momentum of the economy, noting the strengthening in private domestic final demand, to those who stressed the growing fiscal restraint or the other headwinds still facing the economy."
" Participants continued to anticipate that, with appropriate monetary policy, growth would proceed at a moderate pace over the medium run and that the unemployment rate would decline gradually toward levels cons istent with the Committee’s mandate."
" A number of participants noted that the balance of risks to growth remained to the downside, although a couple suggested that such risks had diminished appreciably since last fall."
" However, concerns were expressed that this rate of growth in consumer expenditures might not be sustainable without the support of a notable pickup in business investment and hiring."
"Minutes of the Meeting of April 30–May 1, 2013Page 5_____________________________________________________________________________________________   Participants saw the housing market as having strengthened further during  the intermeeting period and pointed variously to rising house prices, growth in home sales, a lower inventory of houses for sale, a reduction in the average time houses stayed on the market, and encouraging reports from homebuilders."
" More allcash or investor purchases were being reported, and the pace of home purchases overall appeared to be constrained less by a lack of demand than by a lack of homes for sale, in part reflecting fewer newly foreclosed houses coming onto the market."
" Reports included some weakening in manufacturing activity, due in part to reduced demand from abroad, and farm exports in one District were projected to be flat following strong growth in previous years."
" However, the CRE sector s howed some signs of recovery, and survey results in dicated that the terms of CRE lending were easing and loan demand increasing."
 The federal spending sequestration and recent tax increases were viewed as restraining aggregate demand.
Participants generally saw si gns of improvement in labor market conditions despite the weakerthan-expected March payroll employment figure.
" Employment growth in earlier mo nths had been solid, and morerecent improvements included the further decline in the unemployment rate in March and the gradual progress being made in some other labor market indicators."
" However, several participants cautioned that the drop in the unemployment rate in the latest month was also accompanied by another reduction in the labor force participation rate; the decline in labor force participation over recent quarters could indicate that the reduction in overall labor market slack had been substantially smaller than suggested by the change in the unemployment rate over that period."
" One participant commented that assessing the shortfall of employment from its maximum level requi red taking account of not only the gap between the unemployment rate and its corresponding natural rate, but also the gap between the labor force participation rate and its longerterm trend—a trend which was admittedly subject to considerable uncertainty."
 A few pa rticipants mentioned that job growth may have been restrained to an extent by businesses postponing hiring because of uncertainties over the implementation of healthcare legislation or because they were unable to find certain types of skilled workers.
" Both headline and core PCE inflation in the first quarter came in below the Committee’s longerrun goal of  2 percent, but these recent lower readings appeared to be due, in part, to temporary factors; other measures of inflation as well as inflation expectations had remained more stable."
" Accordingly, participants generally continued to expect that inflation would move closer to the 2 percent objective over the medium run."
" Nonetheless, a number of participants expressed concern that inflation was below the Commit tee’s target and stressed that future price developments bore careful watching."
 A couple of participants expressed the view that an additional monetary policy response might be warranted should inflation fall further.
" It was also pointed out that, even absent further disinflation, continued low inflation might pose a threat to the economic recovery by, for example, raising debt burdens."
 One participant focused instead on the upside risks to inflation over the longer term resulting from highly accommodative monetary policy.
"  Financial conditions appeared to have eased further over the intermeeting period:  Longerterm interest rates declined significantly, banks loosened their C&I lending terms and standard s on balance, and competition to make commercial and auto loans was strong."
" In particular, the Bank of Japan announced a new monetary policy program that was considerably more expansionary than markets had expected."
" Financial conditions in Europe improved somewhat over the period, but some participants still saw the situation in Europe as posing downside risks to U.S. growth."
" One participant cautioned that the emergence of financial imbalances could prove difficult for regulators to identify and address, and that it would be appropriate to adjust monetary policy to help guard against risks to financial stability."
 The effects on a range of asset prices of the Bank of Japan’s recent announcement were cited as added evidence that largescale asset purchases were effective in easing financial conditions and thereby helping stimulate economic activity.
" In evaluating the prospects for benefits from asset purchases, however, one participant viewed uncertainty about U.S. fiscal and regulatory policies as interfering with the transmission of monetary policy and as preventing asset purchases from having a meaningful effect on the real economy."
" A number of participants expressed willingness to adjust the flow of purchases downward as early as the June meeting if the economic information received by that time showed evidence of sufficiently st rong and sustained growth; however, views differed about what evidence would be necessary and the likelihood of that outcome."
 Most participants emphasized that it was important for the Committee to be prepared to adjust the pace of its purchases up or down as needed to align the degree of policy accommodation with changes in the outlook for the labor market and inflation as well as the extent of progress toward the Committee’s economic objectives.
 Committee Policy Action  Committee members saw the information received over the intermeeting period as suggesting that economic activity had been expanding at a moderate pace.
" Labor market conditions had shown some improvement in recent months, on balance, but the unemployment rate remained elevated."
" Household spending and business fixed investment advanced, and the housing sector had strengthened further, but fiscal policy was restraining economic growth."
" The Committee expected that, with appropriate monetary policy accommodation, economic growth would proceed at a moderate pace and result in a gradual decline in the unemployment rate toward levels that the Committee judged consistent with its dual mandate."
" Members generally continued to anticipate that, with longerterm inflation expectations stable and persisting slack in resource utilization, inflation over the medium term would likely run at or below the Committee’s 2 percent objective."
"In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, all but one member judged that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy was warranted in order to foster a stronger economic recovery in a context of price stability."
" The Committee also retained its forward guidance about the federal funds rate, including the thresholds on the unemployment and inflation rates."
" One member dissented from the Committee’s policy decision, expressing concern that the continued high level of monetary accommodation increased the risks of future economic and financial imbalances and, over time, could cause an increase in inflation expectations."
"Minutes of the Meeting of April 30–May 1, 2013Page 7_____________________________________________________________________________________________   A few members expressed concerns that investor expectations of the cumulative size of the asset purchase program appeared to have increased somewhat since it was launched last Septembe r despite a notable decline in the unemployment rate and other improvements in the labor market since then."
 Members generally agreed on the need for the Committee to communicate clearly that the pace and ultimate size of its asset purchases would depend on the Committee’s continued assessmen t of the outlook for the labor market and inflation in addition to its judgments regarding the efficacy and costs of additional purchases and the extent of progress toward its economic objectives.
" To highlight its willingness to adjust the flow of purchases in light of incoming information, the Committee included language in the statement to be released following the meeting that said the Committee was prepared to increase or reduce the pace of its purchases to maintain appropriate policy accommodation as the outlook for the labor market or inflation changes."
"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct  the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: “Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster maximum employment and price stability."
The System Open Market Account Manager and the Secretary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the System’s balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the Committee’s objectives of maximum employment and price stability.” The vote encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p.m.: “Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in March suggests that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace.
" Labor market conditions have shown some improvement in recent months, on balance, but the unemployment rate remains elevated."
" Household spending and business fixed investment advanced, and the housing sector has strengthened further, but fiscal policy is restraining economic growth."
" Inflation has been running somewhat below the Committee’s longerrun objective, apart from temporary variations that largely reflect fluctuations in energy prices."
 Longerterm inflation expectations have remained stable.
"Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
" The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic growth will proceed at a moderate pace and the unemployment rate will grad ually decline toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate."
 The Committee also anticipates that inflation over the medium term likely will run at or below its 2 percent objective.
"To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate, the Committee decided to continue purchasing additional agency mortgagebacked securities at a pace of $40 billion per month and longerterm Treasury securities at a pace of $45 billion per month."
" Taken together, these actions should maintain downward pressure on longerterm interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative."
 The Committee is prepared to increase or reduce the pace of its purchases to maintain appropriate policy accommodation as the outlook for the labor market or inflation changes.
"To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee expects that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens."
" In particular, the Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and currently anticipates that this exceptionally low ra nge for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6½ percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee’s 2 percent longerrun goal, and longerterm inflation expectations continue to be well anchored."
" In determining how long to maintain a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy, the Committee will also consider other information, including additional measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments."
" When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longerrun goals of maximum employment and inflation of  2 percent.” Voting for this action:   Ben Bernanke, William C."
Ms. George dissented because she continued to view monetary policy as overly accommodative and therefore as posing risks to the longterm sustainable growth of the economy.
" She expressed concern that the stance of policy might be fostering imbalances and excessive risktaking in some financial markets and institutions, and she cited the potential for the Committee’s ongoing asset purchases to complicate the future conduct of policy, raise uncertainty, and affect future inflation expectations."
" Those principles, which the Committee issued to clarify how it intended to normalize the stance and conduct of monetary policy when doing so eventually became appropriate, included broad principles along with some details about the timing and sequence of specific steps the Committee expected to take."
" In particular, the process of normalizing policy could yield information about the most effective framework for implementing monetary policy in the longer run, and thus about the appropriate size of the SOMA portfolio and level of reserve balances."
" In addition, several participants ra ised the possibility that the federal funds rate might not, in the future, be the best indicator of the general level of shortterm interest rates, and supported further staff study of potential alternative approaches to implementing monetary policy in the longer term and of possible new tools to improve control over shortterm interest rates."
" Moreover, one participant stressed that the Committee’s ability to provide forward guidance about the normalization process was a key monetary policy tool, and revised principles would permit use of that tool to help adjust the stance of policy."
 Participants emphasized that their review of the June 2011 exit strategy principles did not suggest any change in their views about the economic conditions that would eventually warrant beginning the process of normalizing the stance of monetary policy.
