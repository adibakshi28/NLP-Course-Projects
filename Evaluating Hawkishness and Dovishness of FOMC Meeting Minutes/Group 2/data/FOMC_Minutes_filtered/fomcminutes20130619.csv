"Hornstein, Seni or Advisor, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond  John Fernald, Senior Research Adviser, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco   Discussion of Guidelines for Policy Normalization In light of the changes in the System Open Market Account (SOMA) portfolio over the past two years, the Committee again discussed its strategy for the eventual normalization of the stance of monetary policy and the size and composition of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet that was released in the minutes of the Committee’s June 2011 meeting."
" Nonetheless, they agreed that many of the details of the eventual normalization process would likely differ from those specified two years ago, that the appropriate details would depend in part on economic and financial developments between now and th e time when it becomes appropriate to begin normalizing monetary policy, and that the Committee would need to provide additional information about its intentions as that time approaches."
Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information reviewed for the June 18–19 meeting suggested that economic activity continued to increase at a moderate rate in the second quarter.
" Privatesector employment expanded further in recent months, and the unemployment rate in April and May was below its firstquarter average, although it continued to be elevated."
" Consumer price inflation was subdued, partly reflecting transitory influences."
" However, measures of longerrun inflation expectations remained stable."
"Private nonfarm employment rose moderately in April and May, while total government employment continued to decline somewhat."
" The unemployment rate was 7.6 percent in May, little change d from its level in April."
" The labor force participation rate edged up in May, but was still slightly below its firstquarter average, and the employmentto-population ratio increased a bit in recent months."
" The rate of longduration unemployment declined slightly, while the share of workers employed part time for economic reasons was little changed; both of these measures remained well above their prerecession levels."
" Forwardlooking indicators of nearterm labor market activity were mixed but generally pointed to some further improvement in labor market conditions in the coming months:  Household expectaPage 2Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________tions of the labor market situation improved; initial claims for unemployment insurance were little changed, on net, over the intermeeting period; and firms’ hiring plans edged up."
 Some key factors that tend to support growth in household spending were positive in recent months.
"  Conditions in the housing sector generally improved further, but construction activi ty was still at a relatively low level, and demand continued to be restrained by tight credit standards for mortgage loans."
" The U.S. international trade deficit narrowed in March but widened in April, leaving the level of the trade deficit in April similar to its average in the first quarter."
 Nearterm inflation expectations from the Michigan survey were little changed in May and early June; longerterm inflation expectations in the survey also were essentially flat and remained within the narrow range that they have occupied for a number of years.
" Compensation per Minutes of the Meeting of June 18–19, 2013Page 3_____________________________________________________________________________________________hour in the nonfarm business sector increased moderately over the year ending in the first quarter, and, with a small rise in productivity , unit labor costs advanced only a little."
 Foreign economic growth remained sluggish so far this year.
" A slower pace of expansion in many emerging market economies (EMEs), in cluding China, since the beginning of the year offset an increase in the average rate of economic growth in the advanced foreign economies."
" In Japan, where recent policy measures appeared to have boosted household confidence, economic growth picked up noticeably early in the year."
 Recent indicators of Canadian economic activity also strengthened.
 A decline in commodity prices and continued lackluster economic growth contributed to a decline in foreign inflation.
 Federal Reserve communications over the period reportedly were interpreted by market participants as pointing to a less accommodative stance of future monetary policy than they previously had expected.
" The rise in term premiums, in turn, likely reflected in part a reassessment of the pace and ultimate size of the Federal Reserve’s asset purchase prog ram, as well as increased uncertainty about the future path of monetary policy."
  Measures of inflation compensation derived from yields on nominal and inflationprotected Treasury securities fell notably but ended the intermeeting period within their ranges over the past few years.
" Investor perceptions of a somewhat less accommodative tone of Federal Reserve communications, as well as the softerthan-expected reading for the April CPI, likely contributed to the decline in inflation compensation."
" In contrast, equity prices for agency mortgage real estate investment trusts declined, refl ecting the rise in longerterm interest rates, the underperformance of agency MBS, and weakerthan-expected earnings reports."
" Gross issuance of speculativegrade corporate bonds was particularly elevated early in the intermeeting period, but such issuance slowed after midMay in response to the rise in interest rates and in  market volatility."
" Meanwhile, the issuance of synd icated leveraged loans remained robust in April and May, supported by strong investor demand for floatingrate corporate debt instruments."
" Growth in total bank credit moderated in April and May compared with the first quarter, as core loans slowed and securities declined slightly."
" Growth in commercial and industrial loans at large banks decreased noticeably in recent months, reportedly reflecting both increased paydowns and reduced originations."
" The foreign exchange value of the dollar was little changed, on average, relative to the currencies of the advanced foreign economies, but appreciated against EME currencies amid weak incoming data on economic activity and monetary policy easing in some EMEs, along with rising U.S. Treasury yields."
" Staff Economic Outlook  In the economic forecast prepared by the staff for the June FOMC meeting, the projection for nearterm growth of real gross domestic product (GDP) was little changed from the one prepared for the previous meeting."
 These positive factors were partly offset in the staff’s mediumterm GDP projection by higher projected paths for both longerterm interest rates and the foreign exchange value of the dollar.
" Nevertheless, with fiscal policy expected to restrain economic growth this year, the staff still anticipate d that the pace of expansion in real GDP would only moderately exceed the growth rate of potential output."
" The staff also continued to forecast that real GDP would accelerate gradually in 2014 and 2015, suppor ted by accommodative monetary policy, an eventual easing in the effects of fiscal policy restraint on economic growth, increases in Minutes of the Meeting of June 18–19, 2013Page 5_____________________________________________________________________________________________consumer and business sentiment, and further improvements in credit availability and financial conditions."
" The expansion in economic activity was anticipated to slowly reduce the slack in labor and product markets over the projection period, and the unemployment rate was expected to decline gradually."
" In addition, although the staff did not change its view of the longerrun level of the natural rate of unemployment, it judged that the natural rate was on a more pronounced downward trajectory back toward its  longerrun level than previously assumed; as a result, the staff’s projection for the unemployment rate over the next two years was revised down a little, relative to its previous forecast."
"The staff’s forecast for inflation in the near term was also revised down a little from the projection prepared for the previous FOMC meeting, reflecting in part some of the recent softert hanexpected readings on consumer prices."
" Nonetheless, the staff expected that much of the recent softness in inflation would be transitory, and thus did not mate rially change its mediumterm projection."
" The staff projected that inflation would pick up in the second half of this year, but given the assumption of stable longerrun inflation expectations and only modest changes in commodity and import prices as well as forecasts of gradually diminishing resource slack over the projection period, inflation was projected to still be relatively subdued through 2015."
The staff viewed the uncertai nty around the forecast for economic activity as normal relative to the experience of the past 20 years.
" Although the staff saw the outlook for inflation as uncertain, the risks were viewed as balanced and not unusually high."
"Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, meeting participants—the 7 members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks, all of whom participate in the deliberations of the FOMC—submitted their assessments of real output growth, the unemployment rate, inflation, and the target federal funds rate for each year from 2013 through 2015 and over the longer run, under each participant’s judgment of appropriate monetary policy.1  The longerrun projections represent ea ch participant’s assessment of the rate to which each va riable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy."
" Business invest ment advanced, although only modestly, and slower economic activity abroad restrained domestic producti on."
" Overall conditions in the labor market improved further in recent months, although the unemployment rate remained elevated."
" Inflation continued to run below the Committee’s longerrun objective, but longerterm inflation expectations remained stable."
   Most participants anticipated that growth of real GDP would pick up somewhat in the second half of 2013.
" Growth of economic activity was projected to strengthen further during 2014 and 2015, supported by accommodative monetary policy; waning fiscal restraint; and ongoing improv ements in household and business balance sheets, credit availability, and labor market conditions."
" Accordingly, the unemployment rate was projected to gradua lly decline toward levels consistent with the Committee’s dual mandate."
" Many participants saw the downside risks to the mediumrun outlook for the economy and the labor market as having diminished somewhat in recent months, or expressed greater confidence that stronger economic activity was in train."
" However, some participants noted that they remained uncertain about the projected pickup in growth of economic activity in coming quarters, and thus about the prospects for further improvement in labor market conditions, given that, in                                                  1 Although President Pianalto was unable to attend the June 18–19, 2013, FOMC meeting, she submitted economic projections."
"  Page 6Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________recent years, forecasts of a sustained pickup in growth had not been realized."
" Among the factors viewed as supporting consumption were improvements in household balance sheets and in the job market, as well as low interest rates."
" It was noted that the mutually reinforcing dynamic of rising confidence, declining risk pr emiums, improving credit availability, increasing spending, and greater hiring was an important factor in the projected pickup in economic activity but also that this favorable dynamic could be vulnerable to an adverse shock."
"  Housing markets continued to strengthen, with participants variously reporting increases in house prices, sales, and building permits; low inventories of homes on the market; and rising demand for construction supplies."
" The improvement in the housing sector was seen as supporting the broader economy through related spending and employment, with rising real estate values boosting household wealth, confidence, and access to credit."
" Participants  generally were optimistic that the recovery in housing activity would be sustained, although a couple of participants were concerned that the runup in mortgage rates in recent weeks might begin to crimp demand."
" However, the recent increase in mortgage purchase applications was seen as suggesting that th e demand for housing was being driven by factors beyo nd low mortgage rates."
" A number of participants continued to hear that businesses were limiting their capital spending to projects intended to enhance productivity and that they remained reluctant to invest to expand capacity, or to step up hiring."
 Uncertainties about regulatory issues and fiscal policies as well as weak economic activity abroad were cited as factors weighing on busine ss decisionmaking.
" Agriculture remained robust, supported in part by strong demand from emerging market economies."
"While the federal sequestration and the tax increases that became effective earlier in the year were expected to be a substantial drag on economic activity this year, the magnitude and timing of the effects remained unclear."
" Several participants commented that the direct effects of the cutbacks in federal spending, to date, did not appear as great as had been expected, but that they anticipated that fiscal policy would continue to restrain economic growth in coming quarters."
"Participants generally agreed that labor market conditions had continued to improve, on balance, in recent months; many saw the cumulative decline in the unemployment rate and gains in nonfarm payrolls over the past nine months as considerable."
" Reflecting these developments, participants’ forecasts for the unemployment rate at this meeting were lower than those prepared for the September 2012 meeting."
" Among the encouraging aspects of labor market developments since then were the stepup in average monthly gains in private employment, the breadth of job gains across industries, the decline in layo ffs, and a rise in voluntary quits in some industries."
" However, some participants discussed a number of indicators that suggested that the improvement in broad labor market conditions was less than might be implied by the decline in the unemployment rate alone."
" Some pointed out that the rate of hiring still fell short of the pace that they saw as consistent with morenoticeable progress in labor market conditions, that a portion of the improvement in payroll employment since the September meeting was due to data revisions, or that there were no signs of an increase in wage pressures."
" Inflation was low in the mont hs prior to the meeting, with the trends in all broad measures remaining below the Committee’s 2 percent longerrun objective."
" Several transitory factors, including a onetime reduction in Medicare costs, contributed to the recent very low inflation readings."
" Over the past year, both core and overall consumer price inflation trended lower; participants cited various alternative measures of consumer price inflation, including the trimmed mean PCE and CPI as well as the sticky price CPI, that suggested that the slowing was broad based."
 Marketbased measures of inflation expectations decreased over the intermeeting period but remained within their ranges over the past few years.
" Most participants expected inflation to begin to move up over the coming year as economic activity strengthened, but many anticipated that it would remain below the Committee’s 2 percent objective for some time."
" One participant expressed concern about the risk of a more rapid rise in inflation over the medium term, given the highly accommodative stance of monetary policy."
" In contrast, many others worried about the low level of inflation, and a number indicated that they would be watching closely for signs that the shift down in inflation might persist or that inflation expectations were persistently moving lower."
" In their discussion of financial market developments over the intermeeting period, participants weighed the extent to which the rise in market interest rates and increase in volatility reflect ed a reassessment of market participants’ expectations for monetary policy and the extent to which it reflected growing confidence about the economic outlook."
" It was noted that corporate credit spreads had not widened substantially and that the stock market had posted further gains, suggesting that the higher rates reflected, at least in part, increasing confidence that moderate economic growth would be sustained."
 A couple of participants expressed concerns that some financial institutions might not be well positioned to weather a rapid runup in interest rates.
 And a few stated their view that a prolonged period of low interest rates would encourage investors to take on excessive credit or interest rate risk and would distort some asset prices.
 One participant felt that the Committee should explore ways to cali brate the magnitude of the risks to financial stability so that those considerations could be more fully incorporated into deliberations on monetary policy.
Committee Policy Action  Committee members viewed the information received over the intermeeting period as suggesting that economic activity had expanded at a moderate pace.
" Labor market conditions showed further improvement in recent months, on balance, but the unemployment rate remained elevated."
" Household spending and business fixed investment advanced , and the housing sector strengthened further, but fi scal policy was restraining economic growth."
" The Committee expected that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic growth would proceed at a moderate pace and result in a gradual decline in the unemployment rate toward levels consistent with its dual mandate."
" With economic activity and employment continuing to grow at a moderate pace despite tighter fiscal policy, and with global financial conditions less strained , members generally saw the downside risks to the outlook for the economy and the labor market as having diminished since the fall."
" Inflation was running below the Committee’s longerrun objective, partly reflecting transitory influences, but longerrun inflation expectations were stable, and the Committee anticipated that inflation over the medium term would move closer to its 2 percent objective."
"In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, all members but one judged that the outlook for economic activity and inflation warranted the continuation of the Committee’s current highly accommodative stance of monetary policy in order to foster a stronger economic recovery and sustained improvement in labor market conditions in a contex t of price stability."
" In addition, the Committee reaffirmed its intention to keep the target federal funds rate at 0 to      ¼ percent and retained its forward guidance that it anticipates that this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropri ate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6½ percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee’s 2 percent longerrun goal, and longerMinutes of the Meeting of June 18–19, 2013Page 9_____________________________________________________________________________________________term inflation expectations  continue to be well anchored."
"  Regarding the outlook for policy, members agreed that monetary policy in coming quarters would depend on the evolution of the economic outlook and progress toward the Committee’s longerrun objectives of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent."
" While recognizing the improvement in a number of indicators of economic activity and labor market conditions since the fall, many members in dicated that further improvement in the outlook for the labor market would be required before it would be appropriate to slow the pace of asset purchases."
" Some added that they would, as well, need to see more evidence that the projected acceleration in economic activity would occur, before reducing the pace of asset purchases."
" For one member, such a decision would also depend importantly on evidence that inflation was moving back toward the Committee’s 2 percent objective; that member urged the Committee to modify its postmeeting statement to say explicitly that the Committee will act to move inflation back toward its goal."
" A couple of other members also worried that the downside risks to inflation had increased, with one of them suggesting th at the statement more explicitly reflect this increased risk."
" However, several members judged that a reduction in asset purchases would likely soon be warranted, in light of the cumulative decline in unemployment since the September meeting and ongoing increases in private payrolls, which had increased their confidence in the outlook for sustained improvement in labor market conditions."
"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct  the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  “Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster maximum employment and price stability."
 The System Open Market Account Manager and the Secretary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the System’s balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the Committee’s objectives of maximum employment and price stability.” The vote encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p.m.: “Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in May suggests that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace.
" Labor market conditions have shown further improvement in recent months, on balance, but the unemployment rate remains elevated."
" Household spending and business fixed investment advanced, and the housing sector has strengthened further, but fiscal policy is restraining economic growth."
" Partly reflecting transitory influences, inflation has been Page 10Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________running below the Committee’s longerrun objective, but longerterm inflation expectations have remained stable."
"Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
" The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic growth will proceed at a moderate pace and the unemployment rate will grad ually decline toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate."
 The Committee also anticipates that inflation over the medium term likely will run at or below its 2 percent objective.
"To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate, the Committee decided to continue purchasing additional agency mortgagebacked securities at a pace of $40 billion per month and longerterm Treasury securities at a pace of $45 billion per month."
" Taken together, these actions should maintain downward pressure on longerterm interest rates, support mortgage  markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative."
 The Committee is prepared to increase or reduce the pace of its purchases to maintain appropriate policy accommodation as the outlook for the labor market or inflation changes.
"To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee expects that a highly accommodative stance of mone tary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens."
" In particular, the Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to       ¼ percent and currently anticipates that this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6½ percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee’s 2 percent longerrun goal, and longerterm inflation expectations continue to be well anchored."
" In determining how long to maintain a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy, the Committee will also consider other information, including additional measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments."
" When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longerrun goals of maximum employment and inflation of  2 percent.” Voting for this action:   Ben Bernanke, William C."
"Mr. Bullard dissented because he believed that, in light of recent low readings on inflation, the Committee should signal more strongly its willingness to defend its goal of 2 percent inflation."
 He pointed out that inflation had trended down sin ce the beginning of 2012 and was now well below target.
"English Secretary  Page 12Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________Summary of Economic Projections In conjunction with the June 18–19, 2013, Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, meeting participants—the 7 members of the Board of Governors and the 12 presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks, all of whom participate in the deliberations of the FOMC—submitted their assessments of real output growth, the unemployment rate, inflation, and the target federal funds rate for each year from 2013 through 2015 and over the l onger run.¹  Each participant’s assessment was based on information available at the time of the meeting plus his or her judgment of appropriate monetary policy and assumptions about the factors likely to affect economic outcomes."
" The    longerrun projections represent each participant’s judgment of the value to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy."
 “Appropriate monetary policy” is defined as the future path of policy that each participant deems most likely to foster outcomes for economic activity and inflation that best satisfy his or her individual interpretation of the Federal Reserve’s objectives of maximum employment and stable prices.
"Overall, FOMC participants projected that, under appropriate monetary policy, the pace of economic recovery would gradually pick  up over the 2013–15 period, and inflation would move up from recent very low readings but remain subdued (table 1 and figure 1)."
" Almost all of the participants projected that inflation, as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), would be running at or a little below the Committee’s 2 percent objective in 2015."
"As shown in figure 2, most participants judged that highly accommodative monetary policy was likely to be warranted over the next few years to support continued progress toward maximum employment and a gradual return toward 2 percent inflation."
A majority of participants saw the uncertainty associated with their outlook for economic growth and the unemployment rate as similar to that of the past         20 years.
 An equal number of participants also indicated that the risks to the outlook for real gross domestic product (GDP) growth and the unemployment rate were broadly balanced.
" So me participants, however, continued to see downside ri sks to growth and upside Table 1."

" A majority of participants indicated that the uncertainty surrounding their projections for PCE inflation was si milar to historical norms, and nearly all considered the risks to inflation to be either broadly balanced or weighted to the downside."
"The Outlook for Economic Activity Participants projected that, conditional on their individual assumptions about appropriate monetary policy, the economy would grow at a faster pace in 2013 than it had in 2012."
" They also ge nerally judged that growth would strengthen further in 2014 and 2015, in most cases to a rate above their estimates of the longerrun rate of output growth."
" Most participants noted that the high degree of monetary policy accommodation assumed in their projections, continued improvement in the housing sector and the accompanying rise in household net worth, and the absence of further fiscal tightening should result in a pickup in growth; however, they pointed to the foreign economic outlook as an ongoing downside risk."
"The central tendency of participants’ projections for real GDP growth was 2.3 to 2.6 percent for 2013,     3.0 to 3.5 percent for 2014, and 2.9 to 3.6 percent for 2015."
" Most participants no ted that their projections were little changed since March, with the downward revisions to growth in 2013 reflecting the somewhat slowerthan-anticipated growth in the first half."
" The central tendency for the longerrun rate of growth of real GDP was 2.3 to 2.5 percent, unchanged from March."
Participants anticipated a gradual decline in the unemployment rate over the forecast period; a large majority projected that the unemployment rate would not reach their estimates of its longer -run level before 2016.
" The central tendencies of participants’ forecasts for the unemployment rate were 7.2 to 7.3 percent at the end of 2013, 6.5 to 6.8 percent at the end of 2014, and 5.8 to 6.2 percent at the end of 20 15."
" These projections were slightly lower than in March,  with participants reacting to recent data indicating that the unemployment rate had declined by a little more than they had previously expected."
" The central tenden cy of participants’ estimates of the longerrun normal rate of unemployment that would prevail under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy was 5.2 to 6.0 percent, the same as in March."
" Most participants projected that the unemployment rate would converge to their estimates of its longerrun normal rate in five or six years, while some judged that less time would be needed."
"As shown in figures 3.A and 3.B, the distributions of participants’ views regarding the likely outcomes for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate were relatively narrow for 2013."
" Their projections for economic activity were more diverse for 2014 and 2015, reflecting their individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy and its economic effects, the likely rate of improvement in the housing sector and households’ balance sheets, the domestic  implications of foreign economic developments, the prospective path for U.S. fiscal policy, the extent of structural dislocations to the labor market, and a number of other factors."
 The dispersion of participants’ projections for 2015 and for the longer run was little changed relative to March; there was some reduction in the upper ends of the distributions in 2013 and 2014 for both real GDP growth and the unemployment rate.
"The Outlook for Inflation  All participants marked down their projections for both PCE and core PCE inflation in 2013, reflecting the low readings on inflation so far this year."
" Participants generally judged that the recent  slowing in inflation partly reflected transitory factors, and their projections for inflation under appropriate monetary policy over the period 2014–15 were only a littl e lower than in March."
" Participants projected that both headline and core inflation would move up but remain subdued, with nearly all projecting that inflation would be equal to, or somewhat below, the FOMC’s longerrun objective of 2 percent in each year."
" Specifically, the central tendency of participants’ projections for overall inflation, as measured by the growth in the PCE price index, moved down to 0.8 to 1.2 percent in  2013 and was 1.4 to      2.0 percent in 2014 and 1.6 to  2.0 percent in 2015."
" The central tendency of the forecasts for core inflation shifted down slightly in 2013 and 2014, to 1.2 to        1.3 percent and 1.5 to 1.8 pe rcent, respectively; the central tendency in 2015 was little changed and broadly similar to that of headline in flation."
" In discussing factors likely to return inflation to near the Committee’s inflation objective of 2 percent, several participants noted that the reversal of transitory factors currently holding down inflation would cause inflation to move up a little in the near term."
" In addition, many participants viewed the combination of stable inflation expectations and diminishing resource slack as likely to lead to a gradual pickup in inflation toward the Committee’s longerrun objective."

"  The distributions for core and overall inflation in  2015 remained concentrated near the Committee’s longerrun objective, and all participants contin ued to project that overall inflation would converge to the FOMC’s 2 percent goal over the longer run."
"Appropriate Monetary Policy  As indicated in figure 2, mo st participants judged that exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate would remain appropriate for a couple  of years."
All of the participants who judged that raising the federal funds rate target would become appropriate in 2015 also projected that the unemployment rate would decline below 6½ percent during that year and that inflation would remain near or below 2 percent.
" In addition, most of those participants also projected that a sizable gap between the unemployment rate and the longerrun normal level of the unemployment rate would persist until 2015 or la ter."
" Three of the four participants who judged th at policy firming should begin in 2013 or 2014 indicated that, in their judgment, the Committee would need to act relatively soon in order to keep inflation near the FOMC’s longerrun objective of 2 percent and to keep longerrun inflation expectations well anchored."
" Estimates of the longerrun target federal funds rate ranged from 3¼ to 4½ percent, reflecting the Committee’s inflation objective of 2 percent and participants’ individual judgments about the appropriate longerrun level of the real federal fu nds rate in the absence of further shocks to the economy."
"Key factors informing participants’ views of the appropriate path for monetary policy included their judgments regarding the values of the unemployment rate and other labor market indicators that would be consistent with maximum employment; the extent to which the economy fell short of maximum employment and the extent to which inflation was running below the Committee’s longerterm objective of 2 percent; and the implications of alternative policy paths for the likely extent of progress, over the mediumterm, in returning employment and inflation to mandateconsistent levels."
" A couple  of participants noted that persistent headwinds and somewhat slower productivity growth since the end of the recession made their assessments of the longerrun normal level of the federal funds rate, and thus of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate, lower than would otherwise be the case."
"Uncertainty and Risks  A majority of participants reported that they saw the levels of uncertainty about their projections for real GDP growth and unemployment as broadly similar to  Summary of Economic Projections of the Meeting of June 18–19, 2013Page 9_____________________________________________________________________________________________Figure 3.E.

" A majority of participants continued to judge that the risks to their forecasts of real GDP growth and unemployment were broadly balanced, with the remainder generally indicating that they saw the risks to their forecasts for real GDP growth as weighted to the downside and for unemployment as weighted to the upside."
" The main factors cited as contributing to the uncertainty and balance of risks about economic outcomes were the limits on the ability of monetary policy to offset the effects of adverse shocks when shortterm interest rates are near their effective lower bound, as well as challenges with forecasting the path of fiscal policy and economic and financial developments abroad."
Participants reported little change in their assessments of the level of uncertainty and the balance of risks around their forecasts for overall PCE inflation and core inflation.
" Fourteen pa rticipants judged the levels of uncertainty associated with their forecasts for those inflation measures to be broadly similar to, or lower than, historical norms; the same number saw the risks to those projections as broadly balanced."
" A few participants highlighted the likely role played by the Committee’s adoption of a 2 percent inflation goal or its commitment to maintaining accommodative monetary policy as contributing to the recent stability of longerterm                                                  2 Table 2 provides estimates of the forecast uncertainty for the change in real GDP, the unemployment rate, and total consumer price inflation over  the period from 1993 through 2012."
"inflation expectations and, hence, the relatively low level of uncertainty."
" Four pa rticipants saw the risks to their inflation forecasts as tilted to the downside, reflecting, for example, risks of disinflation that could arise from adverse shocks to the economy that policy would have limited scope to offset in the current environment."
" Conversely, one participant saw the risks to inflation as weighted to th e upside, citing the present highly accommodative stance of monetary policy and concerns about the Committee’ s ability to shift to a less accommodative policy stance when it becomes appropriate to do so."

" Thus, in setting the stance of monetary policy, participants consider no t only what appears to be the most likely economic outcome as embodied in their projections, but also the range of alternative possibilities, the likelihood of their occurring, and the potential costs to the economy should they occur."
"Table 2 summarizes the average historical accuracy of a range of forecasts, including those reported in past Monetary Policy Report s and those prepared by the Federal Reserve Board’s staff in advance of meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee."
 The corresponding 70 percent confidence intervals for overall inflation would be 1.2 to 2.8 percent in the current year and   1.0 to 3.0 percent in th e second and third years.
"As with real activity and inflation, the outlook for the future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable uncertainty."
 This uncertainty arises primarily because each participant’s assessment of the appropriate stance of monetary policy depends importantly on the evolution of real activity and inflation over time.
