" Most market participants appeared to view a moderation of inflation and slower, but still positive, economic growth ahead as the most likely scenario."
" Treasury yields fell, reflecting expectations of slower growth as well as a decline in inflation compensation."
 Respondents to the Open Market Desk’s surveys of primary dealers and market participants marked down their growth forecasts for 2022 and 2023 and attached higher odds than in the June survey to the possibility that the U.S. economy could enter a recession in coming quarters.
Market participants perceived falling commodity prices —particularly for oil —and the FOMC’s commitment to bringing inflation down as pointing to lower inflation ahead.
 Market -based measures of near -dated inflation compensation declined and  continued to suggest that inflation would ease in coming quarters.
" In the Desk surveys, respondents also expected inflation to decline substantially in 2023 but assigned meaningful probabilities to a wide range of potential outcomes, including scenarios involving continued elevated rates of inflation."
 Farforward market -based measures of inflation com5 Attended from the discussion of the economic and financial situation through the end of Wednesday’s session.
 These measures continued to suggest that inflation would  return over time to the Committee’s 2  percent  objective .
"In their assessment of the policy outlook, market participants expected significant policy tightening in coming meetings as the Committee continued to respond to the current  elevated level of inflation."
" Regarding developments abroad, central banks in advanced foreign economies (AFEs) had quickened the pace of policy tightening in order to address above -target inflation."
" The deputy manager anticipated that, in the near term, the evolution of takeup at the ON RRP facility would continue to depend on changes in the supply of safe, shortterm investments, and the demand for such investments by money market mutual funds  (MMMFs) ."
" Any deferred asset would not affect the Committee’s ability to implement monetary policy, and the deferred asset would be extinguished over time as net income turned positive again in later years."
" However, the labor market continued to be very tight, and labor demand remained strong."
" Consumer price inflation—as measured by the 12 -month percent age change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) —remained elevated in May, and available information suggested that inflation was  still elevated in June."
 Total nonfarm payroll employment posted a solid gain in June at a pace that was similar to that seen in April and May.
 The unemployment rate was unchanged in June at 3.6  percent .
" The unemployment rate for African Americans moved lower in June , while the rate for Hispanics was unchanged; both rates were noticeably higher than the national average."
" The labor force participation rate and the employment -topopulation ratio both ticked _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of July 26–27, 2022Page 3down in June."
" Nominal wage growth continued to be rapid and broad  based, with average hourly earnings having risen 5.1  percent over the 12  months ending  in June."
 The nominal U.S. international trade deficit narrowed for a second consecutive month in May from its record size in March.
  The available data suggest that net exports contributed positively to GDP growth in the second quarter.
 Consumer price inflation remained elevated.
" Total PCE price inflation was 6.3  percent over the 12  months ending in May, and core PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in consumer energy prices and many consumer food prices, was 4.7  percent  over the same period."
" The trimmed mean measure of 12 -month PCE price inflation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas was 4.0  percent in May, 2.1  percent age points higher than its yearearlier rate of increase."
" In June, the 12month change in the consumer price index (CPI) was 9.1 percent , while core CPI inflation was 5.9 percent  over the same period."
" Survey -based measures of shortrun inflation expectations remained elevated; by contrast, some measures of longer -term inflation expectations moved lower in recent weeks."
" Foreign economic growth slowed notably in the second quarter , as COVID -19related lockdowns led to a sharp contraction in China and Russia’s war against  Ukraine took a toll on foreign activity, especially in Europe."
" Although most commodity prices moved lower from elevated levels in rec ent weeks, foreign consumer price inflation continued to rise through June, mostly reflecting past increases in energy and food prices, but also a continued broadening of price pressures to core goods and services."
  Many foreign central banks tightened monetary policy to address high inflation.
"Staff Review of the Financial Situation  Over the intermeeting period, nominal and real Treasury yields declined significantly , reportedly reflecting increased investor concerns about downside risks to the growth outl ook as well as a decline in inflation compensation."
" Declines in interest rates likely supported stock prices over the period, while some positive earnings releases suggested to investors a less pessimistic corporate outlook."
" Secured overnight rates remained soft relative to the ON RRP offering rate, with the downward pressure on rates attributed to continuing declines in net Treasury bill issuance, elevated demand for collateral in the form of Treasury securities, and MMMFs maintaining very short portfolio maturities amid uncertainty about the near -term outlook for policy rate increases."
  Investors’ concer ns about global economic growth intensified amid weaker -thanexpected data on economic activity and uncertainty about the supply of natural gas from Russia to Europe.
" Sovereign yields and medium -term inflation compensation measures in major AFEs , most notably in the euro area, moved down, with yields largely reversing the sharp increase that occurred just before the June FOMC meeting."
" Borrowing cost s linked to shorter -term interest rates generally increased, largely as a result of expectations of tighter monetary policy."
 Bank interest rates for both commercial and industrial (C&I) and commercial real estate (CRE) loans increased in May and were close to pre -pandemic levels.
 Interest rates on most existing credit card accounts and on auto loans continued to trend upward.
" Business loans at banks expanded at a rapid pace in May and June, despite higher interest rates and a more uncertain economic outlook."
" C&I loans on banks’ books continued to grow robustly, with the July SLOOS citing reasons of increased demand by customers to finance inventory and accounts receivable."
" Equity and corporate debt prices declined significantly since the last assessment , reflecting concerns over slower _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of July 26–27, 2022Page 5growth a nd lower risk appetite in corporate markets."
" The staff also highlighted the financial stability considerations associated with rapid growth in stablecoins , including their vulnerability to runs and the opacity of  many aspects of their operations."
" The staff assessed that households were in a better position than in the mid -2000s to weather a downturn in house prices, noting that mortgage debt growth has significantly lagged growth in house prices, leaving households with substantial equity cushions."
" Recent declines in bank capital ratios were due to higher volatility, interest rate increases , and loan growth, but the recently concluded stress tests suggested that participating banks could absorb losses from a severe recession without breaching regulatory minimums, and some banks  were expected to increase their capital ratios later this year."
" The s taff noted that openend bond and loan mutual funds, which are also vulnerable to largescale investor withdrawals, had experienced outflows as interest rates rose."
"Staff Economic Outlook  The projection for U.S. economic activity prepared by the staff for the July FOMC meeting was noticeably weaker than the June forecast, reflecting the economy’s reduced momentum and current and prospective financial conditions that were expected to provide less support to aggregate demand growth."
" Similarly, the unemployment rate was projected to start rising in the second half of 2022 and to reach the staff’s estimate of its natural rate at the end of next year."
" Total PCE price inflation was expected to be 4.8  percent  in 2022, and core inflation was expected to be 4.0  percent."
" Core PCE price inflation was expected to step down to 2.6  percent  in 2023 and to 2.0  percent  in 2024; the projected deceleration in core prices was attributable to the anticipated resolution of supply– demand imbalances, a labor market that was expected to become less tight over the projection period, and a projected decline in import price inflation."
" Total PCE inflation was expected to decline to 2.2  percent  in 2023 and to 1.9 percent in 2024, reflecting the anticipated slowing in core inflation and a projected rapid deceleration in consumer food and energy prices in coming quarters."
" The staff viewed the risks to the inflation projection as skewed to the upside given the persistent upward surprises seen in the inflation data, the possibility that inflation expectations would become unanchored as a result of the large i ncrease in actual inflation over the past year, and the risk that supply conditions would not improve as much as the baseline projection assumed."
" Nonetheless, job gains had been robust in recent months, and the unemployment rate had remained low."
" Inflation remained elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher food and energy prices, and broader price pressures."
 Participants judged that the war and related events  were creating additional upward pressure on inflation and were weighing on global economic activity.
" Against this background, participants stated that they were highly attentive to inflation risks."
" With regard to current economic activity , participants noted that consumer expenditures, housing activity, business investment, and manufacturing production had all decelerated from the robust rates  of growth  seen in 2021."
 Participants observed that indicators of spending and production suggested  that the second quarter of this year had seen a broad -based softening in economic activity.
" Many participants remarked that some of the slowing, particularly in the housing sector, reflected the emerging response of aggregate demand to the tightening of financial conditions associated with the ongoing firming of monetary policy."
" T he unwinding of the largescale support to consumer spending provided by pandemic -related fiscal policy actions , the inflationinduced reduction in real disposable income, and the move down in the demand for some products from the  elevated levels seen in earlier stages of the pandemic had also all led to slower growth in households’ expenditures ."
" In addition, a deterioration in the foreign economic outlook  and a strong dollar  were contributing to a weakening of external demand."
" Participants anticipated that U.S. real GDP would expand in the second half of the year, but many expected that growth in economic activity would  be at a below -trend pace, as the period ahead would likely  see the response of aggregate demand to tighter financial conditions  become stronger and more broad  based ."
 Participants noted that a period of below -trend  GDP growth would help reduce inflationary pressures and set the stage for the sustained achievement of the Committee’s objectives of maximum employment and price stability.
" In their discussion of the household sector, participants commented that they were seeing many signs in the data, and hearing reports from business contacts, of slower growth in consumer spending."
" Although the aggregate balance sheet for the household  sector was s trong and the unemployment rate was low, consumer sentiment  had deteriorated, and households were reportedly becoming more cautious in their expenditure decisions in light of uncertainty about the economic  outlook and the reduction in purchasing power induced by price rises, particularly increases in the prices of essentials such as food, housing,  and transportation ."
" Participants also observed that housing activity had weakened notably, reflecting the impact of hig her mortgage interest rates  and house prices on home affordability."
" Heightened uncertainty, concerns about inflation, tighter financial conditions, and a cutback in consumer  spending  had led firms to downgrade economic prospects."
 A few participants indicated that some b usiness contacts had assessed that demand and supply were beginning to com e into better balance.
" Participants observed that the labor market remained strong, with the unemployment rate very low, job vacancies and quits close to historically high levels, and an elevated rate of nominal wage growth."
" Many participants also noted, however, that there were some tentative  signs of a softening outlook for the labor market: T hese signs included increases in weekly initial unemployment insurance claims, reductions in quit rates and vacancies, slower growth in payrolls than earlier in the year, and  reports of  cutbacks in hiring in some sectors."
" In addition, although nominal wage growth remained strong according to a wide range of measures, there were some signs of a leveling off or edging down."
" In some Districts, contacts had suggested that labor  demand –supply imbalances  might be diminishing, with firms being more su ccessful in hiring and retaining workers and under less pressure to raise wages."
" Participants observed that, in part because of tighter financial conditions and an associated  moderation in the growth of aggregate demand, growth in employment would likely slow further in the period ahead."
" They noted that this  development would help bring labor demand and supply into better balance, reducing upward pressures on nominal wage growth and aiding the return of inflation to 2 percent ."
 Several participants observed  that the moderation in labor market conditions might well lag the slowdown in economic activity.
 Participants remarked that a moderation in labor market conditions  would likely involve a decline  in the number of job openings as well as a moderate increase  in unemployment from  the current very low  rate.
 Participants noted that indicators of spending and production pointed to  less underlying strength in economic activity than was suggested by indicators of labor market activity.
"  With employment growth still strong, the weakening in spending data implied  unusually large negative readings on labor productivity growth for the year so far ."
" Participants  remarked that the strength of  the labor market suggested  that economic activity may be stronger than implied by the current GDP data, with several participants raising the possibility that the discrepancy might ultimately be re solved  by GDP being revised  upward."
" Several participants also observed, however, that the labor market might not be as tight as some indicators suggested, and they noted that data provide d by the payroll processor ADP and employment as reported in the household survey both seemed to imply a softer labor market than that suggested by the stillrobust growth in payroll  employment as reported in the establishment survey ."
Participants observed that inflation remained unacceptably high and was well above the Committee’s longer -run goal of 2  percent .
" In light of the high CPI reading for June, participants noted that PCE inflation was likely to have increased further  in that month ."
" Participants further observed that inflationary pressures were broad  based , a pattern reflected in large onemo nth increases in the trimmed mean CPI and core CPI measures ."
" Participants remarked that, although recent  declines in gasoline prices would likely help produce lower headline inflation rates in the short term, declines in the prices of oil and some other c ommodities could not be relied on as providing a basis for sustained lower inflation, as these prices could quickly rebound."
 Participants agreed that there was little evidence to date that inflation  pressures were subsiding .
 They judged that inflation would respond to monetary policy tightening and the associated moderation in economic activity with a delay and would likely stay uncomfortably high for some time.
 Several participants stressed that improvements in supply would be helpful but by themselves could not be relied on to resolve the supply and demand imbalances in the economy  sufficiently rapidly .
 Participants emphasized  that a slowing in aggregate dem and would play an important role in reducing inflation pressures.
 They expected that the appropriate firming of monetary policy and an eventual easing of supply and demand imbalances would bring inflation back down to levels consistent with the Committee’s longerrun objective and keep longer -term inflation expectations well anchored.
  Participants discussed a number of factors likely to be helpful in bringing inflation back down to 2  percent .
" In addition to the Committee’s ongoing policy firming  and anchored longer -term inflation expectations, these included competitive pressures restraining price increases, the apparent absence of a wage– price spiral, the tightening of monetary policy abroad, and the impact of the appreciation of the dollar on import prices."
" However, they continued to view commodity price developments as a potential source of upward pressure on inflation."
 Participants noted that expectations of inflation were an important influence on the behavior of actual inflation and stressed that moving to an appropriately restrictive stance of policy was essential for avoiding an unanchoring of inflation expectations .
 Such an unanchoring would make achieving the Committee’s statutory objectives of maximum employment and price stability much more difficult .
" In assessing the current state of inflation Page 8Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________expectations, participants noted that recent readings on marketbased measures of inflation compensation were consistent with longer -term inflation expectations remaining anchored near 2  percent ."
 They judged that this behavior  of longer -term inflation expectations was likely partly due to the actual and expected firming of monetary policy and also likely reflected downward revisions to the growth of aggregate demand  expected  in coming years.
" In addition, several participants  assessed  that the Committee’s ongoing monetary policy tightening was helping alleviate concerns among market participants and wage and price setters that elevated inflation would become entrenched."
" Sever al participants observed that recent readings on survey measures of inflation expectations were broadly consistent with the Committee’s 2 percent  longer -run inflation objective,  although a few participants noted that household surveys were indicating increasing divergences in views about the likely longer -run rate of inflation."
" In their discussion of risks, participants emphasized that they were highly attentive to inflation risks and were closely monitoring developments regarding both inflation and inflation expectations."
" Uncertainty about the mediumterm course of inflation remained high, and the balance of inflation risks remained skewed to the upside, with several participants highlighting the possibility of further supply shocks arising from commodity markets."
 Participants saw the risks to the outlook for real GDP growth as primarily being to the downside.
" These downside risks included the possibility that the tightening in financial conditions would have a larger negative effect on economic activity than anticipated, that there would be further pandemic -related economic disruptions, or that geopolitical and global economic developments would lead to additional adverse economic or financial disturbances."
" Several participants emphasized the importance of avoiding complacency when assessing financial vulnerabilities amid everchanging economic and financial landscapes or the need to look at a broad range of possible outcomes, including scenarios involving  elevated inflation and rising interest rates , when assessing financial vulnerabilities and stability ."
" In their consideration of the appropriate stance of monetary policy, participants concurr ed that the labor market was very tight and that inflation was far above the Committee’s 2  percent  inflation objective."
" Participants noted that recent indicators of spending and production had softened, while, by contrast, job gains had been robust and the unemployment rate had remained low."
" Even so, with inflation elevated and expected to remain so over the near term, some participants emphasized  that the real federal funds rate would likely still be below shorter -run neutral level s after this meeting’s policy rate hike."
" With inflation remaining well above the Committee’s objective, participants judged that moving to a restrictive stance of policy was required to meet the Committee’s  legislative mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability."
" Participants judged that, as the stance of monetary policy tightened further, it likely would become appropriate at some point to slow the pace of policy rate increases while assessing the effects of cumulative policy adjustments on economic activity and inflation."
" Some participants indicated that, once the policy rate had reached a sufficiently restrictive level,  it likely would  be appropriate to maintain that level for some time to ensure that inflation was firmly on a path back to 2  percent ."
"Participants concurred that, in expeditiously raising the policy rate, the Committee was acting with resolve to lower inflation to 2  perce nt and anchor inflation expectations at levels consistent with that longer -run goal."
" Participants noted that the Committee’s credibility with regard to bringing inflation back to the 2  percent  objective, together with its forceful policy actions and communications, had already contributed to a notable tightening of financial conditions that would likely help reduce inflation pressures by restraining aggregate demand."
" Participants generally judged that the bulk of the effects on real activity had yet to be felt because of lags associated with the transmission of monetary policy, and that while a moderation in economic growth should support a return of inflation to 2  percent, the effects of policy firming on consumer prices were not yet apparent in the data."
" In light of elevated inflation and the upside risks to the outlook for inflation, participants remarked that moving to a restrictive stance of the policy rate in the near  term would also be appropriate from a riskmanagement perspective because it would better position the Committee to raise the policy rate further, to appropriately restrictive levels, if inflation were to run  higher than expected."
 Participants judged  that a significant risk facing the Committee was that elevated inflation could become entrenched if the public began to question the Committee’s resolve to adjust the stance of policy sufficiently.
" If this risk materialized, it would complicate the task of returning inflation to 2  percent and could raise substantially the economic costs of doing so."
" Many participants remarked that, in view of the constantly changing nature of the economic environment and the existence of long and variable lags in  monetary policy’s effect  on the economy, there was also a risk that the Committee could tighten the stance of policy by more than necessary to restore price stability."
 Participants reaffirmed their strong commitment to returning inflation to the Committee’s 2  percent  objective.
 Participants agreed that a return of inflation to the 2  percent objective was necessary for sustain ing a strong labor market.
 Participants remarked that it would likely take some time for inflation to move down to the Committee’s objective .
" Participants added that the course of inflation would be influenced by various nonmonetary factors, including developments associated with Russia’s war against Ukraine and with supply chain disruptions ."
" Participants recognized that policy firming could slow the pace of economic growth, but they saw the return of inflation to 2  percent  as critical to achieving maximum employment on a sustained basis."
" Committee Policy Action  In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that recent indicators of spending and production had softened."
" Members also concurred that, nonetheless, job gains had been robust in recent months and the unemployment rate had remained low."
" Members agreed that inflation remained elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher food and energy prices, and broader price pressures."
" In describing the sources of elevated inflation, members judged it pertinent to add a reference to higher food prices to the statement because of the notable rise in these prices  and the importance of food items in households’ budgets ."
 They also agreed that the war and related events were creating additional upward pressure on inflation and Page 10Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________were weighing on global economic activity.
 Members remarked that they remained highly attentive to inflation risks.
" In their assessment of the monetary policy stance necessary for achieving the Committee’s maximum -employment and price -stability goals, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 2 ¼ to 2½ percent and anticipated that ongoing increases in the target range would be appropriate."
" Members agreed that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and that they would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate in the event that risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals."
" They also concurred that their assessments would take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments."
 Members affirmed that the Committee was strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2  percent  objective.
" Nonetheless, job gains have been robust in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low."
" Inflation remains elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher food and energy prices, and broader price pressures."
 The war and related events are creating additional upward pressure on inflation and are weighing on global economic activity.
 The Committee is highly attentive to inflation risks.
 The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2  percent  over the longer run.
 The Committee is strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2  percent  objective.
" In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook."
 The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals.
" The Committee’s assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and internationa l developments.”  Voting for this action:  Jerome H."
" To support the Committee’s decision to raise the target range for the federal funds rate, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to raise the interest rate paid on reserve balances to  2.4 percent, effective July 28, 2022."
