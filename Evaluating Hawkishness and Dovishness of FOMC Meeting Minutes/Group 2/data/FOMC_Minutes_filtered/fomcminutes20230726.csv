"Pesenti, Director of Monetary Policy Research, Federal Reserve Bank of New York  Damjan Pfajar, Group Manager, Division of Monetary Affairs, Board  Samuel Schulhofer -Wohl, Senior Vice President, Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas  Donal d Keith Sill, Senior Vice President, Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia Nitish Ranjan Sinha, Special Adviser to the Board, Division of Board Members, Board  Dafina Stewart, Special Adviser to the Board, Division of Board Members, Board  Gustavo A."
 Market participants interpreted data releases as generally demonstrating economic resilience and a further easing of inflation pressures.
" Spot and forward measures of inflation compensation based on Treasury InflationProtected Securities were little changed over the intermeeting period at levels broadly consistent with the Committee’s 2 percent  longer -run goal, and longer -term surveyand marketbased measures continued to point to inflation expectations being firmly anchored."
 Survey respondents anticipated that both headline and core personal consumption expenditures ( PCE) inflation will decline to 2 percent by the end of 2025.
" Most survey respondents had a modal expectation that a July rate hike would be the last of this tightening cycle, although most respondents also perceived that additional monetary policy tightening after the July FOMC meeting was possible."
" The labor market remained very tight, though the imbalance between demand and supply in the labor market was gradually diminishing."
" Consumer price inflation—as measured by the 12 -mont h percent  change in the price index for PCE —remained elevated in May, and available information suggested that inflation declined but remained  elevated in June."
" In the second quarter, total nonfarm payroll employment posted its slowest average monthly incr ease since the recovery began in mid -2020, though payroll gains remained robust compared with those seen before the pandemic."
" The unemployment rate edged down to 3.6  percent  in June, while the labor force participation rate and the employment -topopulation ratio were both unchanged ."
" The unemployment rates for African Americans and Hispanics, however,  both rose and were well above the national average."
Consumer price inflation continued to show signs of easing but remained elevated.
" Total PCE price inflation was 3.8 percent over the 12 months ending in May, and core PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in energy prices and many consumer food prices, was 4.6  percent over the same period."
" The trimmed mean measure _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of July 25–26, 2023Page 3 of 12 -month PCE price inflation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas was 4.6 percent  in May."
" In June, the 12 -month change in the CPI was 3.0  percent, while core CPI inflation was 4.8  percent  over the same period."
 Measures of shortterm inflation expectations had moved down alongside actual inflation but remained above prepandemic levels.
" In contrast, measures of mediumto longer -term inflation expectations were in the rang e seen in the decade before the pandemic."
" The nominal U.S. international trade deficit narrowed, as a sharp decline in nominal imports of goods and services outpaced a decline in exports."
 The available data suggested  that net exports subtracted from  U.S. GDP growth in the second quarter.
" Indicators of economic activity, such as p u rchasing managers indexes (PMIs), pointed to a stepdown in the pace of foreign growth in the second quarter, reflecting fading of the impetus from China’s reopening, continued anemic growth in Europe, some weakening of activity in Canada and Mexico, as well as weak external demand and the slump in the high -tech industry weighing on many Asian economies."
" Foreign headline inflation continued to fall, reflecting , in part, the pass -through of previous declines in commodity prices to retail energy and food prices."
 Core inflation edged down in many countries but generally remained high.
" In this context, and amid tight labor market conditions, many AFE central banks raised policy rates and underscored the need to raise rates further, or hold them at sufficiently restrictive levels, to bring inflation in their countries back to their targets."
" Staff Review of the Financial Situation  Over the intermeeting period, market participants interpreted domestic economic data releases as indicating continued resilience of economic activity and some easing of inflationary pressures, and they viewed monetary policy communications as pointing to somewhat more restrictive policy than expected."
 Measures of inflation compe nsation rose only slightly for near -term and longer maturities.
 Measures of uncertainty about the path of the policy rate derived from interest rate options remained very elevated by historical standards.
" Short -term interest rates in the AFEs increased modestly, on net, over the intermeeting period as foreign central banks continued to raise policy rates and signal the potential for further tightening."
" Increases in yields were tempered, however, by downside surprises to both inflation and PMIs from some economies."
" The staff’s tradeweighted broad dollar index declined moderately, with the largest moves following releases of Page 4Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ weaker -thanexpected U.S. labor market data and lower -thanexpected U.S. inflation data."
" Auctions of Treasury bills were met with robust demand, as shorter -term bill yields increased relative to other money market rates."
" Banks continued to attract inflows of large time deposits, reflecting higher interest rates offered on new certificates of deposit."
" Issuance of leveraged loans remained limited , reflecting low levels of leveraged buyout and merger and acquisition activity as well as weak investor demand."
" Commercial and industrial (C&I) loan balances contracted modestly in the second quarter, and commercial real estate (CRE) loan growth on banks’ books continued to moderate."
 Aggregate household debt growth remained in line with income growth.
" While nonfinancial businesses remained highly leveraged a nd thus vulnerable to shocks , firms’ debt growth ha s been relatively subdued recently , and their ability to service that debt has been quite high, even among lower -rated firms."
" However, while the overall banking system retained ample loss -bearing capacity, some banks experienced sizable declines in the fair value of their assets as a consequence of rising interest rates."
" However, the staff continued to expect that real GDP growth in 2024 and 2025 would run below their estimate of potential output growth, leading to a small increase in the unemployment rate relative to its current level."
 The staff continued to project that total and core PCE price inflation would move lower in coming years .
" Much of the stepdown in core inflation was expected to occur over the second half of 2023, with forward -looking indicators pointing to a slowing in the rate of increase of housing services prices and with core nonhousing services prices and core goods prices expected to decelerate over the remainder of 2023."
"  Inflation was anticipated to ease further over 2024 as demand –supply imbalances continued to resolve; by 2025, total PCE price inflation was expected to be 2.2  percent, and core inflation was expected to be 2.3  percent ."
" Risks to the staff’s baseline inflation forecast were seen as skewed to the upside, given the possibility that inflation dynamics would prove to be more persistent than expected or that further adverse shocks to supply conditions might occur."
" Moreover, the additional monetary policy tightening that would be necessitated by higher or more persistent inflation represented a downside risk to the projection for real activity."
" Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Out look In their discussion of current economic conditions, participants noted that economic activity had been expanding at a moderate pace."
" Job gains had been robust in recent months, and the unemployment rate remained low."
 Inflation remained elevated.
" They commented that tighter credit conditions for households and businesses were likely to weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation."
" Against this background, the Committee remained highly attentive to inflation risks."
"In assessing the economic outlook, participants noted that real GDP growth had continued to exhibit resilience in the first half of the year and that the economy had been showing considerable momentum."
" A gradual slowdown in economic activity nevertheless appeared to be in progress, consistent with the restraint placed on demand by the cumulative tightening of monetary policy since early last year and the  associated effects on finanPage 6Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ cial conditions."
 Participants remarked on the uncertainty about the lags in  the effects of monetary policy on the economy and discussed the extent to which the effects on the economy stemming from the tightening that the Committee had under taken had already materialized.
 Participants commented that monetary policy tightening appeared to be working broadly as intended and that a continued gradual slowing in real GDP growth would help reduce demand –supply imbalances in the economy.
" Participants assessed that the ongoing tightening of credit conditions in the banking sector, as evi denced in the most recent surveys of banks, also would likely weigh on economic activity in coming quarters."
 Participants noted the recent reduction in total and core inflation rates.
" However, they stressed that inflation remained unacceptably high and that further evidence would be required for them to be confident that inflation was clearly on a path toward the Committee’s 2  percent objective."
 Participants continued to view a period of below-trend growth in real GDP and some softening in labor market conditions as needed to bring aggregate supply and aggregate demand into better balance and reduce inflation pressures sufficiently to  return inflation to 2 percent over time.
" Participants noted that consumer spending had recently exhibited considerable resilience, underpinned by, in aggregate, strong  household balance sheets, robust job and income gains, a low unemployment rate, and rising consumer confidence."
" Nevertheless, t ight financial conditions, primarily reflecting the cumulative effect of the Committee’s shift to a restrictive policy stance, were expected to contribute to slower growth in consumption in the period ahead."
 Some participants observed that recent increases in home prices suggested that the housing sector’s response to monetary policy restraint may have peaked.
" Participants also discussed conditions that could lead to higher economic activity— such as leaner inventories and reduced expectations of a sharp economic slowdown— and factors that could lead to lower economic activity—such as continuing economic uncertainty, the vulnerabilities  of the CRE market, and the ongoing weakness of manufacturing output."
" Participants judged that, over coming quarters, firms would reduce the pace of their investment spending and hiring in response  to tight financial conditions and the slowing of economic activity."
 Participants remarked that the labor market continued to be very tight but pointed to signs that demand and supply were coming into better balance.
" They noted evidence that labor demand was easing —including declines in job openings, lower quits rates, more parttime work, slower growth in hours worked, higher unemployment insurance claims, and more moderate rates of nominal wage growth."
"  Participants also observed, however, that although growth in payrolls had slowed recently, it continued to exceed values consistent over time with an unchanged unemployment rate, and that nominal wages were still rising at rates above levels assessed to be consistent with the sustained achievement of the Committee’s 2  percent  inflation objective."
" Participants judged that further progress toward a balancing of demand  and supply in the labor market was needed, and they expected that additional softening in labor market conditions would take place over time."
 Participants cited a number of tentative signs that inflation pressures could be abating.
" These signs included some softening in core goods prices, lower online prices, evidence that firms were raising prices by smaller amounts than previously, slower increases in shelter prices, and recent declines in survey estimates of shorter -term inflation expectations and of inflation uncertainty."
 Various participants discussed the continued stability of longer -term inflation expectations at levels consistent with 2  percent  inflation over time and the role that the Committee’s policy tightening had played in delivering this outcome.
" Nonetheless, several participants commented that significant disinflationary pressures had yet to become apparent in the prices of core services excluding housing."
" Participants observed that, notwithstanding recent favorable developments, inflation remained well above the Committee’s 2  percent  longer -term objective and that elevated inflation was continuing to harm businesses and households —lowincome families  in particular ."
" Participants stressed that the Committee would need to see more data on inflation and further signs that aggregate demand and aggregate supply were moving into better balance to be confident that inflation pressures were _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of July 25–26, 2023Page 7 abating and that inflation was on course to return to 2 percent over time."
 Participants generally noted a high degree of uncertainty regarding the cumulative effects on the economy of past monetary policy tightening.
" Participants cited upside risks to inflation, including those associated with scenarios in which recent supply chain improvements and favorable commodity price trends did not continue or in which aggregate demand failed to slow by an amount sufficient to restore price stability over time , possibly leading to more persistent elevated inflation or an unanchoring of inflation expectations."
"  In discussing downside risks to economic activity and inflation, participants considered the possibility that the cumulative tightening of monetary policy could lead to a sharper slowdown in the economy than expected , as well as the possibility that the effects of the tightening of bank credit conditions could prove more substantial than anticipated."
" Various participants comm ented on risks that could affect some banks , including unrealized losses on assets resulting from rising interest rates, significant reliance on uninsured deposits, and increased funding costs."
"  In their consideration of appropriate monetary policy actions at this meeting, participants concurred that economic activity had been expanding at a moderate pace."
" The labor market remained very tight, with robust job gains in recent months and the unemployment rate still low, but there were continuing signs that supply and demand in the labor market were coming into better balance."
" Participants also noted that tighter credit conditions facing households and businesses were a source of headwinds for the economy and would likely weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation."
" Although  inflation had moderated since the middle of last year, it remained well above the Committee’s longer -run goal of 2 percent , and participants remained resolute in their commitment to bring inflation down to the Committee’s 2 percent  objective."
" Participants noted that this action would put the stance of monetary policy further into restrictive territory, consistent with reducing demand –supply imbalances in the economy and helping to restore price stability."
" In discussing the policy outlook, participants continued to judge that it was critical that the stance of monetary policy be sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to the Committee’s 2  percent objective over time."
 They noted that uncertainty about the economic outlook remained elevated and agreed that policy decisio ns at future meetings should depend on the totality of the incoming information and its implications for the economic outlook and inflation as well as for the balance of risks.
 Participants expected that the data arriving in coming months would help clarify the extent to which the disinflation process was continuing and product and  labor market s were reaching a better balance between demand and supply.
 This information would be valuable in determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2  percent  over time.
 Participants also emphasized the importance of communicating as clearly as possible about the Committee’s datadependent approach to policy and its firm commitment to bring inflation down to its 2  percent objective.
" With inflation still well above the Committee’s longer -run goal Page 8Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ and the labor market remaining tight, most participants continued to  see significant upside risks to inflation , which could require further tightening of monetary policy."
" Some participants commented that even though economic activity had been resilient and the labor market had remained strong, there continued to be downside risks to economic activity and upside risks to the unemployment rate; these included the possibility that the macroeconomic effects of the tightening in financial conditions since the beginning of last year  could prove more substantial than anticipated."
" A number of participants judged that, with the stance of monetary policy in restrictive territory, risks to the achievement of the Committee’s goals had become more two sided, and it was important that the C ommittee’s decisions balance the risk of an inadvertent overtightening of policy against the cost of an insufficient  tightening."
