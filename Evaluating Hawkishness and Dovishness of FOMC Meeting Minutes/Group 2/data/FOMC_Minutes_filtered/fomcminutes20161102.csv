"Zickler, Senior Advisers, 3 Attended the discussion of the longrun monetary policy implementation framework."
"Hornstein, Senior Advisor, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond  Anthony Murphy, Economic Policy Advisor, Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas  Jonathan Heathcote, Monetary Advisor, Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis   LongRun Monetary Policy Implementation Framework Committee participants continued their discussion of potential longrun frameworks for monetary policy implementation, a topic last discussed at the July 2016 FOMC meeting."
"The staff noted that if the longrun implementation framework was such that the supply of reserve balances was quite abundant, then operational tools that help establish a floor under shortterm interest rates, such as the payment of interest on reserves and the overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) facility, would remain important elements of the operating regime."
" Reserve requirements would probably not be necessary in this case, and the Federal Re serve could likely maintain control of shortterm interest rates without needing to conduct frequent open market operations to adjust the supply of reserves."
" In contrast, if in the long run the supply of reserves was quite small, such as was the situation before the financial crisis, either reserve Page 2Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ requirements or voluntary reserve targets would probably be needed to help stabilize the demand for reserves and increase its predictability."
" The Federal Reserve would likely need to conduct frequent open market operations in this case to maintain adequate control of shortterm interest rates, and banks would probably trade actively in the federal funds market."
" Some shortterm interest rates could display greater volatility under this approach than one in wh ich the level of reserve balances was relatively high, and operational tools to limit both downward and upward pressure on such rates would probably be needed."
" Regardless of the level of reserves, the policy rate in either of these cases could be an unsecured overnight market rate or an interest rate administered by the Federal Reserve."
 Stigma associated with borrowing from the discount window has likely prevented it from effectively enhancing control of shortterm interest rates and improving liquidity conditions in various situations.
"  The staff discussed the possibility that changes in the size and composition of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet, including the duration of its securities holdings, could be used to help achieve policymakers’ macroeconomic goals when shortterm interest rates had declined to their effective lower bou nd—and conceivably when shortterm interest rates were above that bound."
 Policymakers also underscored the importance of taking accoun t of the possibility that neutral shortterm interest rates could remain quite low.
" Such an approach could be compatible with a balance sheet that was much smaller than at present, though likely at least somewhat larger than in the years before the financial crisis, reflecting trend growth of balance sheet items such as currency as well as a larger supply of reserves."
" In addition, such an approach was seen as likely to be relatively simple and efficient to administer, relatively straightforw ard to communicate, and effective in enabling interest rate control across a wide range of circumstances."
 A number of policymakers stated that they continued to view expansion of the balance sheet through largescal e asset purchases as an important tool to provide macroeconomic stimulus in situations in which shortterm interest rates were at their effective lower bound.
" Other important considerations for the choice of policy rate included the volatility of the rate, the breadth of the set of Federal Reserve counterparties that would be required to ensure adequate control of shortterm interest rates, and the role of the policy rate in FOMC communications."
"  At the end of the discussion,  the Chair reiterated that additional experience with the Federal Reserve’s current monetary policy implementation framework would help inform policymakers’ future deliberation of issues related to a longrun framework and that decisions regarding these issues would not be required for some time."
 The Chair also noted that the Federal Reserve would proceed cautiously and would communicate any intended changes to its approach to implementing monetary policy well in advance of making the changes.
"Minutes of the Meeting of November 1–2, 2016Page 3_____________________________________________________________________________________________ Developments in Financial Markets and Open  Market Operations The manager of the System Open Market Account (SOMA) reported on developments in financial markets during the period since the Committee met on September 20–21, 2016, including ch anges in market expectations for U.S. monetary policy, adjustments to foreign central bank monetary policies, and the evolution of investors’ views about risk factors in global financial markets."
" The implementation on October 14 of reforms to the money market fund (MMF) industry generally proceeded smoothly, although the shift in investments from prime to governmentonly money funds had been substantial and left an imprint on levels of some money market interest rates."
 The deputy manager also updated the Committee on implementation of the new framework for investment of foreign currency reserves and on a proposal to publish data series on interest rates in the market for general collateral repurchase agreements.
" Consumer price inflation increased further above its pace early in the year but was still running below the Committee’s longerrun objective of 2 percent, restrained in part by earlier decreases in energy prices and in prices of nonenergy imports."
" Most surveybased measures of longerrun inflation expectations were little changed, on balance, while marketbased measures of inflation compensation moved up but remained low."
"Total nonfarm payroll employment expanded at a solid pace in September, and the unemployment rate was little changed at 5.0 percent."
 The labor force participation rate and the employmentto-population ratio both edged up in September.
 The fourweek moving average of initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits remained low.
" The employment cost index for private industry workers increased 2¼ percent over the 12 months ending in September, and average hourly earnings for all employees increased 2½ percent over the same 12month period."
The unemployment rates for African Americans and for Hispanics remained above the rate for whites but were close to the levels seen just prior to the most recent recession.
" Over the previous two years, manufacturing output was relatively flat, reflecting the effects of weak export demand, spillovers from the earlier d eclines in crude oil and natural gas drilling, and slow do mestic capital investment more generally."
"Real personal consumption expenditures (PCE) increased at a moderate pace in the third quarter, supported by continued gains in employment, real disposable personal income, and households’ net worth."
 Real inventory investment was positive in the third quarter after subtracting substantially from real GDP growth in the second quarter.
"Net exports contributed positively to real GDP growth in the third quarter, largely because of the strength of soybean exports."
" The nominal U.S. international trade deficit widened in August relative to July, as imports rose more than exports."
" Import growth was driven by higher imports of capital goods and services, while export growth was led in part by higher exports of industrial supplies and automotive products."
" The Census Bureau’s advance trade estimates for September suggested a narrowing of the trade deficit, with further growth in exports and a decline in imports relative to August."
" Core PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in food and energy prices, was about 1¾ percent over those same 12 months, held down in part by decreases in the prices of nonenergy imports over part of this period and by the passthrough of earlier declines in energy prices into the prices of other goods and services."
" Over the 12 months ending in September, total consumer prices as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) rose 1½ percent, while core CPI inflation was around 2¼ percent."
" The Michigan survey measure of median longerrun inflation expectations moved down in October to a new historical low, and the longerrun measure from the Blue Chip Economic Indicators also declined slightly."
 Measures of longerrun inflation expectat ions from the Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants were unchanged in October.
Foreign real GDP growth appeared to pick up significantly in the third quarter following weak growth in the second quarter that primarily reflected contractions in Canada and Mexico.
" The recovery of oil production in Canada boosted economic activity there, and a pickup in U.S. economic activity and strong household spending in Mexico supported a sharp rebound in Mexican GDP growth."
 The improvements in these economies more than offset some moderation of growth in China.
" In the euro area and Japan, economic growth continued at a modest pace."
 Inflation gene rally remained subdued in both the emerging market economies and the advanced foreign economies (AFEs).
" A notable exception was the United Kingdom, where inflationary pressures increased, partly as a result of a substantial depreciation of the pound in recent months."
" Nominal yields were pushed up by an increase in inflation compensation, which appeared attributable to a combination of factors, including the recent rise in oil prices and a decline in investors’ concerns about the risk of very low inflation outcomes, as implied by quotes on inflation caps and floors."
 Concerns about U.K.–EU negotiations and higher U.K. inflation compensation also drove up 10year gilt yields.
 Gross issuance of corporate bonds was robust in September amid strong global demand for bonds and low yields.
 Growth of commercial and industrial (C&I) loans slowed overall in the third quarter but picked up in September.
" Demand and lending standards for C&I loans remained unchanged, on net, in the third quarter, acco rding to the October Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS)."
" Growth of CRE loans on banks’ books continued to be strong in the third quarter, even though a significant number of banks reported in the Page 6Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ October SLOOS that they had tightened lending standards on CRE loans."
 Interest rates on 30year fixedrate mortgages edged up but stayed at a low level.
 Growth in both revolving and nonrevolving loans remained robust.
Monetary policy announcements by foreign central banks had limited effects on asset prices.
" At its September monetary policy meeting, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) announced that it will purchase Japanese government bonds (JGBs) to keep the yield on 10year JGBs around zero; the BOJ also announced that it will continue to expand the monetary base until consumer price inflation exceeds the 2 percent target and stays above the target in a stable manner."
"Staff Economic Outlook In the U.S. economic projection prepared by the staff for the November FOMC meeting, the pace of real GDP growth was forecast to be faster over the second half of this year than in the first half, as business investment was anticipated to turn up and the drag from inventory investment was expected to end."
" The staff’s forecast for real GDP growth over the next couple of years was also slightly lower than in the previous projection, primarily reflecting the effects of higher assumed paths for the dollar and for crude oil prices."
 The unemployment rate was forecast to edge down gradually through the end of 2018 and then flatten out in 2019; the path for the unemployment rate was a little higher than in the previous projection but was still projected to run below the staff’s estimate of its longerrun natural rate.
"The nearterm forecast for consumer price inflation was somewhat higher than in the previous projection, reflecting incoming data on core prices and energy prices."
" Beyond the near term, the inflation forecast was generMinutes of the Meeting of November 1–2, 2016Page 7_____________________________________________________________________________________________ ally little revised."
" The staff continued to project that inflation would increase over the next several years, as food and energy prices along with the prices of nonen-ergy imports were expected to begin rising steadily this year."
" However, inflation was projected to be marginally below the Committee’s longerrun objective of 2 percent in 2019."
"The staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as similar to the average of the past 20 years."
" Consistent with the downside risks to aggregate demand, the staff viewed the risks to its outlook for the unemployment rate as tilted to the upside."
 The risks to the projection for inflation were seen as roughly balanced.
" The possibility that longerterm inflation expectations may have edged down was roughly counterbalanced by the risks that somewhat firmer inflation this year could be more persistent than expected, particularly in an economy that was projected to continue operating above its longrun potential."
"Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants agreed that information received over the intermeeting period indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that growth of economic activity had picked up from the modest pace seen in the first half of the year."
" Job gains had been solid in recent months, although the unemployment rate was little changed."
" Inflation had increased somewhat since earlier this year but remained below the Committee’s 2 percent longerrun objective, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and in prices of nonen-ergy imports."
" Marketbased measures of inflation compensation had moved up but remained low; most surveybased measures of longerterm inflation expectations had changed little, on balance, in recent months."
" They continued to anticipate that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity would expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions would strengthen somewhat further."
" Inflation was expected to rise to 2 percent over the medium term, as the transitory effects of past declines in energy and import prices continued to dissipate and the labor market strengthened furthe r."
" A substantial majority viewed the nearterm risks to the economic outlook as roughly balanced, although a few participants judged that significant downside risks remained, citing various factors including the low value of the neutral federal funds rate and its proximity to the effective lower bound, the possibility of weakerthan-expected growth in foreign economies, the continued uncertainty associated with the United Kingdom’s exit from the EU, or financial fragilities in some countries."
 Participants agreed that the Committee should continue  to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments.
"Participants noted that although real GDP growth in the third quarter was appreciably above the slow pace of the first half, it had been boosted in part by transitory factors, including a surge in agricultural exports and a bounceback in inventory investment."
" Excluding these factors, underlying economic growth had been relatively modest:  Growth of consumer spending had slowed from its brisk pace earlier in  the year, residential investment had fallen again, and business fixed investment had remained soft."
" Real economic activity was expected to advance at a moderate pace in coming quarters, primarily reflecting solid growth in consumer spending, consistent with ongoing employment gains, increases in household wealth, and low interest rates."
Participants continued to expect economic activity in the coming quarters to be supported by a pickup in business investment.
"Participants noted that economic growth in many foreign economies remained subdued, and that inflation rates abroad generally were st ill quite low."
" Some participants observed that important international downside risks remained, including constraints on monetary policies in the low interest rate environments of some countries; investors’ concerns about developments potentially affecting profitability in the European banking sector; the possible consequences of upcoming negotiations and eventual terms of the United Kingdom’s exit from the EU; potential deleterious effects from rapid credit growth in China; and the potential for further dollar appreciation, which could restrain U.S. inflation for a considerable time."
" Reports from some Districts pointed to a tightening in labor markets, evid enced by shortages of qualified workers in some occupations, increases in overtime hours, or a pickup in wage inflation."
" On the other hand, from a business cycle perspective, the increase in the participation rate in recent months was consistent with a tightening labor market and an economy nearing full employment; furthermore, it was not clear that output growth above the economy’s potential growth rate would succeed in drawing new entrants permanently into the labor force."
" Overall, while some participants expressed the view that the economy was close to or at full employment, several others judged that appreciable slack could remain in the labor market."
" Some participants characterized wage pressures as only moderate, although one noted that wage growth was similar to its pace at the peak of the previous economic expansion."
Readings on headline and core PCE price inflation had come in somewhat higher than expected in recent months.
" Participants generally  regarded this as a positive development, consistent with headline inflation rising over the medium term to the Committee’s objective of 2 percent."
" A few participants observed that it was difficult to judge how much of the uptick in core PCE price inflation reflected transitory factors, while a couple of others saw the incoming data as suggesting that inflation could move up to the Committee’s objective more rapidly than previously expect ed."
" Participants discussed possible policy implications of the risks surrounding the outlook for inflation, in cluding the possibility that achieving the Committee’s inflation objective sooner than previously anticipated could cause a revision in market expectations of the path for policy rates and a sharp rise in longerterm interest rates, or the possibility that a further appreciation of the dollar stemming from developments abroad could renew disinflationary pressures and postpone the need for policy firming."
 Some participants regarded the uptick in marketbased measures of inflation compensation over the intermeeting period as a welcome suggestion of further progress toward the Committee’s inflation goal.
" However, several cautioned that these measures remained low or that the measures still appeared to embed a significant weight on undesirably low inflation outcomes."
" The median expectation for inflation over the next 5 to 10 years from the Michigan survey edged down in October to a new historical low, although it was noted that this drop could be explained by a reduction in the number of respondents who had previously expected relatively high inflation outcomes."
" Overall, part icipants judged that surveybased measures of inflation expectations had been fairly stable in recent months."
" Among the factors cited were a persistent decline in the neutral federal funds rate, and depressed term premiums likely owing to the elevated size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet as well as the reduced likelihood of high inflation relative to several decades ago."
"In connection with the participants’ discussion of the longrun monetary policy implementation framework, many participants noted that the Committee’s broader monetary policy strategy needed both to be considered in conjunction with the design of such a framework and to receive careful further consideration in its own right."
" In particular, accumulating evidence of slow trend productivity and output growth and associated persistently low levels of neutral interest rates, both in the United States and abroad, had potential implications for the most effective policy implementation framework for the Federal Reserve in coming years as well as the monetary policy strategy that would best promote the Committee’s macroeconomic objectives."
" Among other factors that needed to be taken into account, it was observed that neutral real shortterm interest rates could decline further if central ba nk balance sheets contracted or the positive effects of quantitative easing on economic activity waned over time."
 Participants agreed that issues associated with monetary policy implementation should be discussed within the context of the current and potential future economic and financial environment and the Committee’s stra tegy for monetary policy.
" Participants saw recent information as indicating that labor market conditions had improved further and considered the firming in inflation and inflation compensation to be positive developments, consistent with continued progress toward the Committee’s 2 percent in flation objective."
" However, a number of participants expressed the view that some modest slack remained in the labor market or noted that readings on inflation compensation and inflation expectations remained low."
" A few participants advocated an increase at this meeting; they viewed recent economic developments as indicating that labor market conditions were at or close to those consistent with maximum employment and expected that recent progress toward the Committee’s inflation objective would continue, even with further gradual steps to remove monetary policy accommodation."
" In addition, many judged that risks to economic and financial stability could increase ov er time if the labor market overheated appreciably, or expressed concern that an extended period of low interest rates risked intensifying incentives for investors to reach for yield, potentially leading to a mispricing of risk and misallocation of capital."
" In contrast, some others judged that allowing the unemployment rate to fall below its longerrun normal level for a time could result in favorable supplyside effects or help hasten the return of inflation to the Committee’s 2 percent objective; noted that proximity of the federal funds rate to the effective lower bound places potential constraints on monetary policy; or stressed that global developments could pose risks to U.S. economic activity."
" More generally, it was emphasized that decisions regarding nearterm adjustments of the stance of monetary policy would appropriately remain dependent on the outlook as informed by incoming data, and participants expected that economic conditions would evolve in a manner that would warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate."
"Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that the information received since the Committee met in September indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that growth of economic activity had picked up from the Page 10Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ modest pace seen in the first half of this year."
" Although the unemployment rate was little changed in recent months, job gains had been solid."
" Inflation had increased somewhat since earlier this year but was still below the Committee’s 2 percent longerrun objective, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and in prices of nonen-ergy imports."
" Marketbased measures of inflation compensation had moved up but remained low; most surveybased measures of longerterm inflation expectations were little changed, on balance, in recent months."
"With respect to the economic outlook and its implications for monetary policy, members continued to expect that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity would expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions would strengthen somewhat further."
" Members generally observed that labor market conditions had improved appreciably over the past year, a development that was particularly evident in the solid pace of monthly payroll employment gains and the increase in the labor force participation rate."
 It was noted that allowing the unemployment rate to modestly undershoot its longerrun normal level could foster the return of inflation to the FOMC’s 2 percent objective over the medium term.
" A few members, however, were concerned that a sizable undershooting of the longerrun normal unemployment rate could necessitate a steep subsequent rise in policy rates, undermining the Committee’s prior communications about its expectations for a gradually rising policy rate or even posing risks to the economic expansion."
"Members continued to expect inflation to remain low in the near term, but most anticipated that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of  monetary policy, inflation would rise to the Committee’s 2 percent objective over the medium term."
" Some members observed that the increases in inflation and inflat ion compensation in recent months were welcome, although a couple of them noted that inflation was still running below the Committee’s objective."
" Against this backdrop and in light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, members agreed that they would continue to carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward the Committee’s inflation goal."
"After assessing the outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, as well as the risks around that outlook, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at ¼ to ½ percent at this meeting."
" But a majority of members judged that the Committee should, for the time being, await some further evidence of progress toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation before increasing the target range for the federal funds rate."
 They saw inflation as close to the 2 percent objective and viewed an increase in the federal funds rate as appropriate at this meeting because they judged that the economy was essentially at maximum employment and that monetary policy was unable to contribute to a permanent further improvement in labor market conditions in these circumstances.
"  The Committee agreed that, in determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, it would assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation."
" This assessment would take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pres sures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
 The Committee also directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve’s agency mortgagebacked securities transactions.” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p.m.: “Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in September indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and growth of economic activity has picked up from the modest pace seen in the first half of this year.
" Although the unemployment rate is little changed in recent months, job gains have been solid."
" Inflation has increased somewhat since earlier this year but is still below the Committee’s 2 percent longerrun objective, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and in prices of nonenergy imports."
" Marketbased measures of inflation compensation have moved up but remain low; most surveybased measures of longerterm inflation expectations are little changed, on balance, in recent months."
"Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
" The Committee expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat further."
 Inflation is expected to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of past declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further.
 The Committee continues to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments.
" The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting further improvement in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation."
"In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation."
" This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
" In light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, the Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal."
"Ms. George judged that, with the labor market near full employment and inflation approaching the Committee’s 2 percent objective, another step in the gradual adjustment of monetary policy was appropriate."
" While a low level of the target range for the federal funds rate had supported achieving the Committee’s objectives, such low levels were no longer warranted and, if maintained, could pose a risk to the sustainability of the economic expansion with stable inflation."
" In particular, she viewed the supplyside benefits of allowing labor utilization to rise above its neutral level as temporary, and noted that monetary policy was unable to affect the longerrun growth potential of the economy."
Ms. Mester judged that the economy was essentially at full employment in terms of what can be achieved through monetary policy.
" The unemployment rate was at her estimate of its longerrun normal level, and labor market conditions were projected to tighten further."
" In addition, she noted that inflation was moving up and was close to the Committee’s 2 percent objective."
" In these circumstances, she believed it appropriate to gradually increase the target range for the federal funds rate from its current low level, which would allow monetary policy to continue to lend support to the economic expansion."
 Ms. Mester saw taking the next step in removing policy accommodation as consistent with the Committee’s communications about the appropriate path for monetary policy.
"Consistent with the Committee’s decision to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the Board of Governors took no action to change the interest rates on reserves or discount rates."
