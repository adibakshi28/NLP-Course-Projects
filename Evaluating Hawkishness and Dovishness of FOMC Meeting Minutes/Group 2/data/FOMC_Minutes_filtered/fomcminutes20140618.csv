 Monetary Policy Normalization Meeting participants continued their discussion of i ssues associated with the eventual normalization of the stance and conduct of monetary policy.
 A staff presentation included some possible strategies for i mplementing and communicating monetary policy during a period when the Federal Reserve will have a very large balance sheet.
 It was ge nerally agreed that an ON RRP facility with an interest rate set below the IOER rate could play a useful su pPage 2Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________    porting role by helping to firm the floor under money market interest rates.
" In addition, participants examined po ssibilities for changing the calculation of the effective federal funds rate in order to obtain a more robust measure of overnight bank funding rates and to apply lessons from international efforts to develop improved standards for benchmark interest rates."
" Several participants emphasized that, although the ON RRP rate would be useful in controlling shortterm interest rates during normalization, they did not antic ipate that such a facility would be a permanent part of the Committee’s longer -run operating framework."
" F inally, a number of participants expressed concern about conducting monetary policy operations with nontraditional counterparties."
" These participants thought that an earlier change to the rei nvestment policy would involve risks to the economic outlook if it was seen as suggesting that the Committee was likely to tighten policy more rapidly than currently anticipated or if it had unexpectedly large effects in MBS markets; moreover, an early change could add complexity to the Committee’s communications at a time when it would be clearer to signal changes in pol icy through interest rates alone."
" However, some parti cipants favored ending reinvestments prior to the first firming in policy interest rates, as stated in the Commi ttee’s exit strategy principles announced in June 2011."
" Those participants thought that such an approach would avoid weakening the credibility of the Commi ttee’s communications reg arding normalization, would act to modestly reduce the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet, or would help prepare the public for the eventual rise in shortterm interest rates."
" Regardless of whether they preferred to introduce a change to the Comm ittee’s reinvestment policy before or after the initial tightening in shortterm interest rates, a number of participants thought that it might be best to follow a graduated approach with respect to winding down r einvestments or to manage reinvestments in a manner that would smooth the decline in the balance sheet."
"Overall, participants generally expressed a preference for a simple and clear approach to normalization that would facilitate communication to the public and e nhance the credibility of monetary policy."
 Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information reviewed for the June 17 –18 meeting indicated that real gross domestic product (GDP) had dropped significantly early in the year but that econo mic growth had bounced back in recent months.
" The average pace of employment gains stepped up, and the unemployment rate declined markedly in April and held steady in May, although it was still elevated."
" Consumer price inflation picked up in recent months, while measures of longerrun inflation expectations remained stable."
 Total nonfarm payroll employment expanded in April and May at a faster rate than the a verage monthly pace during the previous two quarters.
 The unemployment rate dropped to 6.3 percent in April and remained at that level in May.
" However, the labor force participation rate also declined in April and then held steady in May, while the employmentto-population ratio remained flat."
" Both the share of workers employed part time for economic reasons and the rate of longduration unemployment edged down in recent months, although both measures were still high."
" Initial claims for unemployment insurance decreased slightly, on net, over the intermeeting period, and the rate of job openings stepped up in April; nevertheless, the rate of hiring was unchanged and remained at a modest level."
The U.S. international trade deficit widened in March and in April.
"U.S. consumer price inflation, as measured by the PCE price index, was about 1½ percent over the 12 months ending in April, below the Committee’s longer -run o bjective of 2 percent."
" Over the same 12month period, consumer energy prices rose faster than total consumer prices, while consumer food prices climbed more slo wly than overall prices; core PCE inflation —which e xcludes food and energy prices —was also around       1½ percent."
" In May, the consumer price index (CPI) increased at a faster pace than in the preceding few months; both food and energy prices rose more briskly, and core CPI inflation also stepped up."
" Nearterm inflation expectations from the Michigan survey declined slightly, on balance, in May and early June, while longerterm inflation expectations from the survey were little changed."
"Foreign real GDP growth slowed in the first quarter, especially in China and some other emerging market economies."
" Real GDP also increased more slowly in Canada, in part because of severe winter weather, and the pace of economic activity remained weak in the euro area."
" Economic growth continued to be strong in the United Kingdom, and economic activity jumped in Japan as household spending surged in advance of April’s consumption tax hike."
 Indicators for the se cond quarter generally suggested that foreign economic growth picked up from the first quarter.
" In some advanced foreign economies, inflation moved up recently from earlier low readings."
" Inflation continued to be low, however, in the euro area, and the European Ce ntral Bank (ECB) announced additional stimulus measures."
"Staff Review of the Financial Situation On balance, financial conditions in the United States remained supportive of growth in economic activity and employment:  The expected path of the federal funds rate was slightly lower in the long run, yields on longerterm Treasury securities moved down modestly, equity prices rose, corporate bond spreads narrowed, and the foreign exchange value of the dollar was little changed."
" Market participants continued to discuss the decreases in long forward rates since the beginning of the year and pointed to a variety of domestic and global factors possibly contributing to this trend, including lower expectations for potential growth and policy rates in the longer run, a decline in inflation risk premiums, purchases of longerterm sec urities by priceinsensitive investors, unwinding of short Treasury positions, and falling interest rate uncertainty."
 Measures of longerhorizon inflation compensation based on Treasury InflationProtected Securities r emained about steady.
"Broad stock price indexes rose over the intermeeting period, apparently boosted by a more optimistic a ssessment of nearterm economic prospects and likely supported by continued low interest rates."
" Measures of uncertainty in other financial markets also declined; results from the Desk’s primary dealer survey suggested this development might have reflected low realized vo latilities, generally favorable economic news, less unce rtainty for the path of monetary policy, and complace ncy on the part of market participants about potential risks."
" Growth in student loans moderated further but r emained solid, and outstanding auto loans continued to pick up."
"The expected path of ECB policy rates implied by ma rket quotes for shortterm interest rates fell over the intermeeting period, as investors anticipated the easing of policy announced by the ECB at its June meeting."
"Page 6Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________    Staff Economic Outlook  In the economic forecast prepared by the staff for the June FOMC meeting, real GDP growth in the first half of this year as a whole was lower, on net, than in the projection for the April meeting."
" However, the staff still anticipated that real GDP growth would rebound bris kly in the second quarter, consistent with recent indic ators for consumer spending and business investment, along with the expectation that exports and inventory investment would return to more normal levels and that economic activity that had been restrained by the severe winter weather would bounce back."
" Primarily because of the combination of recent downward su rprises in the unemployment rate and weakerthan-expected real GDP, the staff slightly lowered its a ssumed pace of potential output growth this year and next and slightly decreased its assumption for the nat ural rate of unemployment over this same period."
" As a result, the staff’s medium -term forecast for real GDP growth was revised down a little on balance."
" The faster pace of real GDP growth was expected to be supported by diminishing drag on spending from changes in fiscal policy, increases in consumer and business confidence, further improvements in credit availability, and a pickup in the rate of foreign econo mic growth."
" The expansion in economic activity was anticipated to slowly reduce resource slack over the projection period, and the unemployment rate was e xpected to decline gradually to the staff’s estimate of its longerrun natural rate in the medium term."
" In the longerrun outlook, the staff slightly lowered its a ssumptions for real GDP growth and the level of equ ilibrium real interest rates."
The staff’s forecast for inflation in the near term was revised up a little as recent data showed somewhat fas ter increases in consumer prices than anticipated.
" Ho wever, the mediumterm projection for inflation was r evised down slightly, reflecting a reassessment by the staff of the underlying trend in inflation."
 The staff co ntinued to forecast that inflation would remain below the Committee’s longer -run objective of 2 percent over the next few years.
" With longerrun inflation expect ations assumed to remain stable, changes in commodity and import prices expected to be subdued, and slack in labor and product markets anticipated to diminish slowly, inflation was projected to rise gradually toward the Committee’s objective."
 The staff continued to pr oject that inflation would reach the Committee’s obje ctive in the longer run.
" The staff’s June projections for the unemployment rate, real GDP growth, and inflation over the next few years were all a little lower, on balance, than those in its March for ecast."
The staff viewed the extent of uncertainty around its June projections for real GDP growth and the une mployment rate as roughly in line with the average over the past 20 years.
" Nonetheless, the risks to the forecast for real GDP growth were viewed as tilted a little to the downside, as neither monetary policy nor fiscal policy was seen as being well positioned to help the economy withstand adverse shocks."
" At the same time, the staff viewed the risks around its outlook for the unemplo yment rate and for inflation as roughly balanced."
"Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, the meeting participants submitted their assessments of real output growth, the unemployment rate, inflation, and the ta rget federal funds rate for each year from 2014 through 2016 and over the longer run, under each participant’s judgment of appropriate monetary policy.3  The longerrun projections represent each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy."
"In their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants viewed the information received over the intermeeting period as suggesting that economic activity was rebounding in the second qua r3 Four members of the Board of Governors and the pres idents of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks submitted projections."
" Although participants marked down their expectations for average growth of real GDP over the first half of 2014, their projections beginning in the second half of 2014 changed little."
" Over the next two and a half years, they continued to expect economic activity to expand at a rate sufficient to lead to a further decline in the unemployment rate to levels close to their current assessments of its longerrun normal value."
"  Among the factors anticipated to support the sustained economic expansion were a ccommodative monetary policy, diminished drag from fiscal restraint, further gains in household net worth, improving credit conditions for households and bus inesses, and rising employment and wages."
" While infl ation was still seen as running below the Committee’s longerrun objective , longerrun inflation expectations remained stable and the Committee anticipated that inflation would move back toward its 2 percent obje ctive over the forecast period."
" Most participants viewed the risks to the outlook for the economy, the labor market, and inflation as broadly balanced."
" In their view, an important element in the economic outlook was a pickup in income, from higher wages as well as ong oing employment gains, that would be expected to su pport a sustained rise in consumer spending."
" Despite attractive mortgage rates, housing demand was seen as being damped by such factors as restrictive credit conditions, particularly for hous eholds with low credit scores; high down payments; or low demand among younger homebuyers, due in part to the burden of student loan debt."
 Several other participants suggested the possibility that more persistent structural changes in housing demand assoc iated with an aging population and evolving lifestyle preferences were boosting demand for multifamily units at the expense of singlefamily homes.
" Contacts in a number of Districts reported that they were generally optimistic about the business outlook, although in a couple of regions respondent s remained cautio us about prospects for stronger economic growth or worried about a renewal of federal fiscal restrai nt after the current congressional budget agreement expires."
Favorable financial conditions appeared be supporting economic activity.
" While information about mortgage lending w as mixed, a number of participants reported increases in C&I lending by banks in their Districts, a pickup in loan demand at banks, or better credit quality for borrowers."
" In particular, low implied volatility in equity, currency, and fixedincome markets as well as signs of increased risktaking were viewed by some participants as an indication that market participants were not factoring in sufficient uncertainty about the path of the economy and monetary policy."
"  At the same time, it Page 8Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________    was noted that monetary policy needed to continue to promote the favorable financial conditions required to support the economic expansion."
"In discussing economic developments abroad, a couple of participants noted that recent monetary policy a ctions by the ECB and the Bank of Japan had improved the outlook for economic activity in those areas and could help return inflation to target."
 And a couple of pa rticipants expressed uncertainty about the outlook for economic growth in Japan and China.
" In addition, se veral saw developments in Iraq and Ukraine as posing possible downside risks to global economic activity or potential upside risks to world oil prices."
" That improvement was evidenced by the decline in the unemployment rate as well as by changes in other indicators, such as solid gains in nonfarm payrolls, a low level of new claims for unemployment insurance, uptrends in quits and job openings, and more positive views of job availability by households."
" In assessing labor market conditions, pa rticipants again offered a range of views on how far conditions in the labor market were from those assoc iated with maximum employment."
" Even so , several participants pointed out that both longand shortterm unemployment and measures that include marginally attached workers had declined."
" Most parti cipants projected the improvement in labor market co nditions to continue, with the unemployment rate moving down gradually over the medium term."
" However, a couple of participants anticipated that the decline in unemployment would be damped as parttime workers shift to fulltime jobs and as nonparticipants rejoin the labor force, while a few others commented that they expected no lasting reversal of the decline in labor force participation."
 Several noted that a return to growth in real wages in line with productiv ity growth would provide welcome support for hous ehold spending.
"Readings on a range of price measures —including the PCE price index, the CPI, and a number of the analyt ical measures developed at the Reserve Banks —appeared to provide evidence that inflation had moved up recently from low levels earlier in the year, consistent with the Committee’s forecast of a gradual i ncrease in inflation over the medium term."
" Some participants expressed concern about the persistence of belowtrend inflation, and a couple of them suggested that the Committee may need to allow the unemployment rate to move below its long errun normal level for a time in order keep inflation expectations anchored and return infl ation to its 2 percent target, though one participant e mphasized the risks of doing so."
" In contrast, some others expected a faster pickup in inflation or saw upside risks to inflation and inflation expectations because they anticipated a more rapid decline in economic slack."
" Some participants suggested that the Committee’s  communications about its forward guidance should emphasize more strongly that its policy decisions would depend on its ongoing assessment across a range of indicators of economic activity , labor market conditions , inflation and inflation expectations , and financial market developments."
" For example, a number of participants noted their concern that a more gradual approach might be appropriate if forecasts of abovetrend economic growth later this year were not realized."
" And a couple suggested that the Committee might need to strengthen its commitment to maintain sufficient policy accommodation to return inflation to its target over the Minutes of the Meeting of June 17–18, 2014Page 9_____________________________________________________________________________________________    medium term in order to prevent an undesirable d ecline in inflation expectations."
"  Alternatively, some other participants expressed concern that economic growth over the medium run might be faster than currently expected or that the rate of growth of potential output might be lower than current ly expected, calling for a more rapid move to begin raising the federal funds rate in order to avoid significantly overshooting the Committee’s unemployment and inflation obje ctives."
" In light of these considerations, participants generally agreed that if incoming information continued to support its expectation of improvement in labor market conditions and a return of inflation toward its longerrun objective, it would be appropriate to complete asset purchases with a $15 billion reduction in the pace of purchases in order to avoid having the small, remaining level of purchases receive undue focus among investors."
"Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy in the period ahead, members judged that information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in April ind icated that economic activity was rebounding from the decline in the first quarter of the year."
" The unemployment rate, though lower, remained elevated."
" Fiscal policy was restraining economic growth, al though the extent of restraint was diminishing."
" The Committee expected that, with appropriate policy a ccommodation, economic activity would expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions would continue to improve gradually, moving toward those the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate."
" Inflation was running below the Committee’s longer -run objective, but the Committee anticipated that with stable inflation expectations and strengthening economic activity, inflation would, over time, return to the Committee’s 2 pe rcent objective."
" However, members continued to re cognize that inflation persistently below its longerrun objective could pose risks to economic performance and agreed to monitor inflation developments closely for evidence that inflation was moving back toward its objective over the medium term."
"Members judged that the economy had sufficient u nderlying strength to support ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and a return of inflation t oward the Committee’s longer -run 2 percent objective , and thus agreed that a further measured reduction in the pace of the Committee’s asset purchases was a ppropriate at this meeting."
" Members again judged that, if incoming i nformation broadly support ed the Committee’s expect ations for ongoing progress toward meeting its dual o bjectives of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent, the Committee would likely reduce the pace of asset purchases in further measured steps at future meetings."
" The Committee reiterated, however, that purchases were not on a preset course, and that its d ecisions about the pace of purchases would remain co ntingent on its outlook for the labor market and inflation as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases."
 The guidance continued to emphasize that the Co mmittee’s decisions about how long to maintain the cu rrent target range for the federal funds rate would depend on its assessment of actual and expected progress toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.
" The Committee again stated that it Page 10Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________    currently anticipated that it likely would be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time after the asset pu rchase program ends, especially if projected inflation continued to run below the Committee’s 2  percent longerrun goal, and provided that longerterm infl ation expectations remain ed well anchored."
"  The fo rward guidance also reiterated the Committee’s expec tation that even after employment and inflation are near mandateconsistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run."
"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to ex ecute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: “Consistent with its statutory  mandate, the Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster maximum employment and price st ability."
 The System Open Market Accoun t manager and the secretary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing develo pments regarding the System’s balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the Committee’s objectives of maximum employment and price stability.”  The vote encompassed approval of the statement b elow to be released at 2:00 p.m.: “Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in April indicates that growth in economic activity has rebounded in recent months.
" The unemployment rate, though lower, remains elevated."
" Fiscal policy is r estraining economic growth, although the e xtent of restraint is diminishing."
" Inflation has been running below the Committee’s longerrun objective, but longerterm infl ation expectations have remained stable."
" The Commi ttee expects that, with appropriate policy a ccommodation, economic activity will e xpand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions will continue to improve grad ually, moving toward those the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate."
"The Committee reco gnizes that inflation persistently below its     2 percent objective could pose risks to ec onomic performance, and it is monitoring i nflation developments carefully for evidence that inflation will move back toward its o bjective over the medium term."
" In light of the cumulative progress toward maximum employment and the improv ement in the outlook for labor market cond itions since the inception of the current asset purchase program, the Committee decided to make a further measured reduction in the pace of its asset purchases."
" The Committee’s si zable and stillincreasing holdings of longerterm securities should maintain downward pressure on longerterm interest rates, su pport mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more acco mmodative, which in turn should promote a stronger economic recovery and help to ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with the Committee’s dual mandate."
" If incoming information broadly supports the Committee’s expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market co nditions and inflation moving back toward its longerrun objective, the Committee will likely reduce the pace of asset purchases in further measured steps at future meetings."
" However, asset purchases are not on a pr eset course, and the Committee’s decisions about their pace will remain contingent on the Committee’s outlook for the labor market and inflation as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such pu rchases."
"To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee today reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy remains appropriate."
"In d etermining how long to maintain the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess pr ogress —both realized and expected —toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation."
" This assessment will take into account a wide range of info rmation, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments."
" The Committee continues to anticipate, based on its asses sment of these factors, that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for a co nsiderable time after the asset purchase pr ogram ends, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee’s     2 percent longerrun goal, and provided that longerterm inflation expectations remain well anchored."
"When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its lon ger-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent."
" The Committee cu rrently anticipates that, even after emplo yment and inflation are near mandateconsistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Commi ttee views as normal in the longer run.”  Voting for this action:  Janet L."
"English Secretary Page 12Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________   Summary of Economic Projections  In conjunction with the June 17 –18, 2014, Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, meeting participants submitted their assessments of real output growth, the unemployment rate, inflation, and the ta rget federal funds rate for each year from 2014 through 2016 and over the longer run.1  Each participant’s  assessment was based on information available at the time of the meeting plus his or her judgment of appr opriate monetary policy and assumptions about the fa ctors likely to affect economic outcomes."

pick up notably in the second half of 2014 and remain in 2015 and 2016 above their estimates of the long errun normal rate of economic growth.
" Consistent with that outlook, the unemployment rate was projected to continue to decline toward its longerrun normal level over the projection period (table 1 and figure 1)."
" The majority of participants projected that inflation, as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), would rise to a level at or slightly below the Committee’s 2 percent objective in 2016."
The majority of participants expected that highly a ccommodative monetary policy would remain appropr iate over the next few years to foster progress toward the Federal Reserve’s longer -run objectives.

" In addition, most participants considered the risks to the outlook for real GDP growth and the u nemployment rate to be broadly balanced, and a majority saw the risks to inflation as broadly balanced."
" Howe ver, some saw the risks to their forecasts for economic growth or inflation as tilted to the downside, and a couple saw the risks to their forecasts for inflation as tilted to the upside."
" The Outlook for Economic Activity Participants generally projected that, conditional on their individual assumptions about appropriate mon etary policy, real GDP growth would pick up notably in the second half of this year and remain in 2015 and 2016 above their estimates of the long errun normal rate of output growth ."
" All participants revised down their projections of real GDP growth for the first half of 2014 compared with their projections in March , but most left their forecasts for the remainder of the pr ojection period largely unchanged."
" Participants generally judged that real GDP growth in the first half of this year was held down by transitory factors depressing output early in the year, and they pointed to a number of factors that they expected would continue to contribute to a pickup in economic growth later this year and next , including rising household net worth, dimi nished restraint from fiscal policy , improving labor ma rket conditions, and highly accommodative monetary policy ."
" The central tendencies of participants’ proje ctions for real GDP growth were 2.1 to 2.3 percent in 2014, 3.0 to 3."
 The central tendency for the longerrun normal rate of growth of real GDP was 2.1 to 2.
Participants continued to anticipate a gradual decline in the unemployment rate over the projection period.
" The central tendencies of participants’ forecasts for the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of each year were 6.0 to 6.1 percent in 2014, 5.4 to 5.7 percent in 2015, and 5.1 to 5.5 percent in 2016."
" Nearly all partic ipants revised down their projected paths for the une mployment rate this year and next relative to their March projections, with the majority pointing to the decline in the unemployment rate in recent months as a reason for the downward revision ."
" The central tendency of participants’ estimates of the longer -run normal rate of unemployment that would prevail under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy also edged down, to 5.2 to 5.5 percent."
 Most participants projected that the unemployment rate would be close to their individual estimates of its longerrun level at the end of 2016.
 Figures 3.A and 3.B show that participants continued to hold a range of views regarding the likely outcomes for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate over the next two years.
" The diversity of views reflected their individual assessments of the rate at which the headwinds that have been holding back the pace of the economic recovery would abate and of the anticipated path for foreign economic activity, the trajectory for growth in household net worth, and the appropriate path of monetary policy."
" Relative to March, the dispe rsion of participants’ projections for real GDP growth narrowed a bit in 2014 but was largely unchanged over the next two years , and the dispersion of projections for the unemployment rate over the entire projection period was little changed."
"The Outlook for Inflation Compared with March, the central tendencies of parti cipants’ projections for inflation were largely unchanged for all years in the projection period, although many participants marked up a bit their projections for inflation in 2014."
" The vast majority of participants anticipated that, on average, both headline and core inflation would rise gradually over the next few years, and the majority of participants expected headline inflation to be at or slightly below the Committee’s 2 percent o bjective in 2016."
" Specifically, the central tendencies for PCE inflation were 1."
 It was noted that some combination of stable inflation expectations and steadily diminishing resource slack was likely to contribute to a gradual rise of infl ation back toward the Committee’s longer -run objective of 2 percent.
 T he ranges of participants’ projections for overall inflation were little changed relative to March.
 The forecasts for PCE inflation in 2016 were at or below the Committee’s longer -run objective.
" Similar to the projections for headline inflation, the projections for core inflation in 2016 were concentrated at or below    2 percent."
"Appropriate Monetary Policy As indicated in figure 2, nearly all participants judged that low levels of the federal funds rate would remain appropriate for the next few years."
" In particular,        12 participants thought that the first increase in the target federal funds rate would not be warranted until sometime in 2015, and 3 judged that policy firming Page 4Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________Figure 3.A.

" All participants projected that the unemployment rate would be below 6 percent at the end of the year in which they judged the initial increase in the federal funds rate to be warranted, and all but one anticipated that inflation would be at or below the Committee’s longerrun objective at that time."
 Most participants projected that the unemployment rate would remain above their estimates of its longerrun normal level at the end of the year in which they saw the federal funds rate increasing from its effective lower bound.
" In contrast, the rest of these participants saw the fede ral funds rate at the end of 2016 as still significantly low despite their projections that the unemployment rate would be close to or below their individual longerrun projections and inflation would be at or close to 2 pe rcent at that time."
" These participants cited some combination of a lower equilibrium real interest rate, co ntinuing headwinds from the financial crisis and subs equent recession, and a desire to raise the federal funds rate at a gradual pace after liftoff as explanations for the stilllow level of the projected federal funds rate at the end of 2016."
 A couple of participants also me ntioned broader measures of labor market slack that may take longer to return to their normal levels than the unemployment rate.
" Estimates of the longerrun level of the federal funds rate ranged from 3¼ to about    4¼ percent, reflecting the Committee’s inflation obje ctive of 2 percent and participants’ individual judgments regarding the appropriate longerrun level of the real federal funds rate in the absence of further shocks to the economy."
" Compared with March, s ome partic ipants revised down their estimates of the longerrun federal funds rate, with a lower assessment of the lon ger-run level of potential output growth cited as a contributing factor for the majority of those revisions."
"Participants’ views of the appropriate path for mon etary policy were informed by their judgments about the state of the economy, including the values of the u nemployment rate and other labor market indicators that would be consistent with maximum employment, the extent to which the economy was currently falling short of maximum employment, the prospects for inflation to return to the Committee’s longer -term objective of  2 percent, and the balance of risks around the outlook."
 Many participan ts also mentioned the prescriptions of various monetary policy rules as factors they considered in judging the appropriate path for the federal funds rate.
"Uncertainty and Risks The vast majority of participants continued to judge the levels of uncertainty about their projections for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate as broadly similar to the norms during the previous 20 years (fi gure 4 ).  Most participants continued to judge the risks to real GDP growth and the unemployment rate to be                                                    Table 2 provides estimates of the forecast uncertainty for the change in real GDP, the unemployment rate, and total consumer price inflation over the period from 1994 through 2013."

"  Similar to March, nearly all participants continued to judge the risks to the unemployment rate to be broadly balanced."
Almost all participants saw the level of uncertainty and the balance of risks around their forecasts for overall PCE inflation and core inflation as little changed from March.
" Most participants continued to judge the levels of uncertainty associated with their forecasts for the two inflation measures to be broadly similar to histor ical norms, and a majority continued to see the risks to those projections as broadly balanced ."
" A few partic ipants, however, view ed the risks to their inflation for ecasts as tilted to the downside, reflecting, for example, the possibilities that the recent low levels of inflation could prove more persistent than anticipated, and that the upward pull on prices from inflation expectations might be weaker than assumed."
" Conversely, two participants saw upside risks to inflation, with one citing uncertainty about the timing and efficacy of the Co mmittee’s withdrawal of accommodation."

" As described in the box  “Forecast Uncertainty,” under certain assumptions, there is about a 70 percent probability that actual outcomes for real GDP, unemployment, and consumer prices will be in ranges implied by the average size of projection errors made in the past."
 Page 12Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________           Forecast Uncertainty     The economic projections provided by the members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks inform discussions of monetary policy among policymakers and can aid public understan ding of the basis for policy actions.
" Thus, in setting the stance of monetary policy, participants consider not only what appears to be the most likely economic outcome as e mbodied in thei r projections, but also the range of alternative possibilities, the likelihood of their occurring, and the potential costs to the economy should they occur."
" Table 2 summarizes the average historical accuracy of a range of forecasts, including those reported in past Monetary Policy Report s and those prepared by the Federal Reserve Board’s staff in advance of meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee."
 The corresponding 70 percent confidence intervals for overa ll inflation would be 1.2 to 2.8 percent in the current year and    1.0 to 3.0 percent in the second and third years.
" As with real activity and inflation, the ou tlook for the future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable uncertainty."
 This uncertainty arises primarily because each parti cipant ’s assessment of the appropriate stance of monetary policy depends importantly on the evolution of real activity and inflation over time.
