" Specifically, at Treasury auctions, the Desk rolls over the maturing securities held in the SOMA into newly issued securities in proportion to the issue amounts of the new securities, and the Federal Reserve receives the interest rate deter mined competitively in the public auction of the newly issued securities."
" The effective  federal funds rate, currently defined as the volume -weighted mean of interest rates on federal funds transactions, would be redefined as the volume -weighted median."
" Staff analysis suggested that the      volume -weighted median would usually differ little  from the volume -weighted mean, but that the median would be a more robust statistic when some trades occur at interest rates that are unrepresentative of general market conditions or when there are data problems such as reporting errors."
 Consumer price inflation continued to run below the FOMC’s longerrun objective of 2 percent and was restrained significantly by earlier declines in energy prices and decreases in prices of nonenergy imports.
" Survey measures of longerrun inflation expectations remained stable, while marketbased measures of inflation compensation were still low."
Total nonfarm payroll employment expanded at a faster pace in April and May than in the first quarter.
" The unemployment rate was 5.5 percent in May, about the same                                                  4 On February 2, 2015, in addition to announcing preliminary plans to improve the calculation of the effective federal funds rate, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York indicated that it planned to begin to publish an additional interest rate, the overnight bank funding rate, which will be based on both federal funds transactions and the Eurodollar transactions of U.S.-managed banking offices."
" The labor force participation rate and the employmentto-population ratio rose a bit over April and May, and the share of workers employed part time for economic reasons edged down on net."
Growth in real personal consumption expenditures (PCE) appeared to pick up early in the second quarter from its modest pace in the previous quarter.
" Minutes of the Meeting of June 16–17, 2015Page 3_____________________________________________________________________________________________Growth in real private expenditures for business equipment and intellectual property products appeared to remain relatively slow in the second quarter."
"The U.S. international trade deficit widened substantially in March but narrowed in April, leaving the deficit modestly wider than in February."
"  While real net exports made a large negative contribution to the change in real GDP in the first quarter of 2015, April data suggested that net exports might be a considerably smaller drag on GDP growth in the second quarter of the year."
" Core PCE inflation, which excludes food and energy prices, was 1¼ percent over the same           12month period, restrained in part by declines in the prices of nonenergy imports."
" Measures of expected longerrun inflation from a number of surveys, including the Michigan survey, the Survey of Professional Forecasters, and the Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers, remained stable."
" However, marketbased measures of inflation compensation were still low, although somewha t higher than early in the year."
" The employment cost index increased 2¾ percent over the four quarters ending in the first quarter, while compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector rose 1¾ percent over the same period."
Economic growth in many foreign economies slowed in the first quarter.
" Real GDP contracted in Canada, where lower oil prices depressed investment, and in Brazil, where business and consumer confidence weakened and high inflation prompted a significant tightening of monetary policy."
" In addition, real GDP growth slowed in China and Mexico."
" By contrast, the euroarea economy continued its recovery, and real GDP growth in Japan increased sharply."
 Inflation rates turned positive in recent months in many foreign economies following the trough in oil prices earlier this year.
" Most of the increase in nominal yields was attributable to a rise in real yields, as measures of inflation compensation were relatively stable."
"Page 4Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________On balance, the expected path of the federal funds rate implied by futures contracts steepened noticeably beyond 2015, with a portion of this shift coming after the May employment report."
" Meanwhile, financing conditions for small businesses continued to improve, though the growth of small business loans on banks’ books remained subdued, partly reflecting stilltepid demand for credit from owners of small business es."
"  Interest rates on 30year fixedrate mortgages increased about 30 basis points, broadly in line with MBS yields and other longerterm rates."
  The rise in yields was also supported by the release of some strongerthan-expected inflation data in the euro area and by European Central Bank communications that volatility in yields was to be expected.
" While the dollar declined against the euro and other European currencies, it rose against the Canadian dollar, the yen, and many emerging market currencies, boosted in part by the strong U.S. employment report for May."
"Staff Economic Outlook  In the economic forecast prepared by the staff for the June FOMC meeting, real GDP growth in the second half of this year was expected to step up from its pace in the first half."
" However, economic growth in the second half was projected to be a little lower than in the projection prepared for the April meeting, largely reflecting a small downward revision to the forecast for household spending."
 The staff’s medium -term projection for real GDP growth was essentially unrevised from the previous forecast.
" The staff continued to project that real GDP would expand at a faster pace than potential output in 2016 and 2017, supported primarily by increases in consumer spending, even as the normalization of the stance of monetary policy was assumed to proceed."
 The expansion in economic output over the medium term was anticipated to trim resource slack; the unemployment rate was expected to decline gradually to the staff’s estimate of its longerrun natural rate.
"The staff’s forecast for inflation in the near term was little changed, and it was unrevised over the medium term."
" Energy prices and nonoil import prices were expected to begin steadily rising next year, but the staff projected Minutes of the Meeting of June 16–17, 2015Page 5_____________________________________________________________________________________________that inflation would continue to be below the Commi ttee’s longer -run objective of 2 percent over 2016 and 2017."
" However, inflation was anticipated to reach 2 percent thereafter, with inflation expectations in the longer run assumed to be consistent with the Committee’s objective and slack in labor and product markets projected to have waned."
"The staff viewed the extent of uncertainty around its June projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as similar to the average over the past 20 years."
" The risks to the forecasts for real GD P growth and inflation were seen as tilted a little to the downside, reflecting the staff’s assessment that neither monetary policy nor fiscal policy was well positioned to help the economy withstand substantial adverse shocks."
" At the same time, the staff saw the risks around its outlook for the unemployment rate as roughly balanced."
"Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, members of the Board of Governors and Federal Reserve Bank presidents submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, inflation, and the federal funds rate for each year from 2015 through 2017 and over the longer run, conditional on each participant’s judgment of appropria te monetary policy.5  The longerrun projections represent each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy."
"In their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants viewed the information received over the intermeeting period as indicating that economic activity was expanding moderately after little change in the first quarter of the year."
" The unemployment rate was unchanged over the period between the April and June meetings , but payroll employment posted solid gains , and, on balance, a range of labor market indicators suggested that underutilization of labor resources diminished somewhat."
" Although participants marked down their expectations for the rate of increase in real GDP over the first half of the year, their projections for economic growth in the second half of 2015 and over 2016 and 2017 were broadly similar to those prepared for the March meeting."
" Under the ir respective assumptions about appropriate monetary policy, participants generally expect ed real GDP to expand at a rate sufficient to continue to move labor market conditions toward levels judged consistent with the Committee’s dual mandate."
"  Inflation readings available since the April meeting continued to run below the Committee’s longer -run objective, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and continued decreases in prices of nonenergy imports."
 Participants continued to project a gradual rise in inflation toward 2 percent over the medium term as the labor market improved further and the transitory effects of earlier declines in energy and import prices dissipated.
"In discussing how to interpret the reported weakness in real GDP during the first quarter, participants considered alternative estimates of real economic activity based on various datafiltering models maintained by Board and Reserve Bank staff."
 Some participants indicated that the higher alternative estimates seemed more consistent with the increases in real gross domestic income and private domestic final purchases in the first quarter as well as the strength in employment and hours worked.
" Page 6Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________While participants generally saw the risks to their projections of economic activity and the labor market as balanced, they gave a number of reasons to be cautious in assessing the outlook."
" Some pointed to the risk that the weakerthan-anticipated rise in economic activity over the first half of the year could reflect factors that might continue to restrain sales and production, and that economic activity might not have sufficient momentum to sustain progress toward the Committee’s objectives ."
" Others, however, viewed the strength in the labor market in recent months as potentially signaling a strongerthan-expected bounceback in economic activity."
" Several mentioned their uncertainty about whether Greece and its official creditors would reach an agreement and about the likely pace of economic growth abroad, particularly in China and other emerging market economies."
 Other concerns were related to whether the apparent weakness in productivity growth recently would be reversed or continue.
" On the one hand, a rebound in productivity growth in coming quarters might restrain hiring and slow the improvement in labor market conditions."
" On the other hand, if productivity growth remain ed weak, the labor market might tighten more quickly and inflation might rise more rapidly than anticipated."
" Moreover, a number of fundamental factors determining consumer spending remained positive, including the boost to real income from the earlier decline in energy prices, low interest rates, sustained moderate gains in wage and salary income , stronger household balance sheets, and  the high levels of household s’ confidence about the economic outlook and about their income prospects."
" Nonetheless, home constructio n was still below the trend that would appear consistent with population growth, sales remain ed at low levels, and credit availability was still relatively tight."
" Still, cutbacks in spending on drilling and mining equipment, slow demand for other business equipment, and the drag on exports from slow foreign demand and previous increases in the dollar continued to weigh on industrial production."
" They generally agreed that labor market conditions had improved somewhat over the intermeeting period, variously citing solid increases in payroll employment and job openings; low levels of unemployment insurance claims; and, despite an unchanged unemployment rate, some further reduction in broader measures of underutilization, particularly among those not actively searching for jobs, but available and interested in work."
The ongoing rise in labor demand appeared to have begun to result in a firming of wage increases.
" Recent readings on the employment cost inde x, hourly compensation, and average hourly earnings of employees suggested some acceleration in wages."
Participants discussed how the incoming information regarding inflation influenced their expectations for reaching the FOMC’s 2 percent inflation objective over the medium term.
 Total PCE inflation continued to run below the Committee’s objective.
" However, participants  noted that the apparent stabilization of crude oil prices and the foreign exchange value of the dollar would reduce the downward pressure on inflation from falling prices of energy and imported goods."
" Core PCE price inflation, as measured on a 12month change basis, had slowed slightly from an already low rate."
" However, several participants pointed out that the 3month change in that index had firmed recently , signaling some improvement in the inflation outlook."
" In addition, some cited alternative measures of inflation, such as the trimmed mean and median consumer price indexes (CPIs) and the trimmed mean PCE, which continued to run at higher levels than overall PCE inflation."
" Survey measures of longerterm inflation expectations remained stable, and marketbased measures of inflation compensation, while still low, were higher than earlier in the year."
" Nonetheless, a couple of participants continued to be concerned that the extended period of low inflation might persist and feed through to inflation expectations , citing estimates from various inflation forecasting models and the downtrend in the 10year CPI projections in the Survey of Professional Forecasters."
"  Participants continued to anticipate that, with appropriate monetary policy, inflation would move up to or toward the Committee’s objective over the medium term."
" Among the factors influencing the trajectori es of their inflation forecasts were the ir outlooks for the pace of real activity, labor market conditions and wage developments , and inflation expectations."
"During their discussion of economic conditions and monetary policy, participants commented on a number of considerations associated with the timing and pace of policy normalization."
" Many participants emphasized that, in order to determine that the criteria for beginning policy normalization had been met, they would need additional information indicati ng that economic growth was strengthening, that labor market conditions were continuing to improve , and that inflation was moving back toward the Committee’s objective."
 Other concerns that were mentioned were the potential erosion of the Committee’s credibility if inflation were to persist below 2 percent and the limited ability of monetary policy to offset downside shocks to inflation and economic activity when the federal funds rate was at its effective lower bound.
 One such risk was the possibility that the Committee might need to tighten more rapidly than financial markets currently anticipate —an outcome that could be associated with a significant rise in longerterm interest rates or heightened Page 8Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________financial market volatility.
 Another was that prolonging a high degree of monetary policy accommodation might result in an undesirable increase in inflation or might have adverse consequences for financial and macroeconomic stability.
Participants also discussed plans for publishing operational details regarding the implementation of monetary policy around the time of the first increase in the target range.
"  Participants agreed that this strategy provided a number of advantages, including focusing the Committee’s postmeeting statement on information about economic conditions and the stance of monetary policy; communicating the details of policymakers’ operational decisions, including the FOMC’s domestic policy directive, in one place; reducing the risk that Federal Reserve communications regarding any technical adjustments to the operation of its policy tools after the commencement of policy firming might be mistaken as conveying information about the stance of policy; and emphasizing that operational decisions regarding the Federal Reserve’s policy tools will be made in concert by the Federal Reserve Board and the FOMC with the aim of maintaining the federal funds rate in the range established by the FOMC."
"Committee Policy Action In its discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, the Committee agreed that the weakness in the first quarter was at least in part the result of transitory factors , and members anticipated that economic growth would resume in the second quarter."
" Although they expressed some uncertainty about the extent of the likely nearterm pickup, members expected moderate economic growth over the medium term."
 Ongoing gains in employment and wages along with a high level of consumer confidence were expected to provide support to household spending.
" Inflation had been well below the Committee’s longerrun objective, but, with oil prices and the foreign exchange value of the dollar stabilizing, members expected that inflation would gradually rise toward 2 percent over the medium term."
 Members thus saw economic conditions as continuing to approach those consistent with warranting a start to the normalization of the stance of monetary policy.
" In these circumstances, members agreed to continue making decisions about the appropriate target range for the federal funds rate on a meetingby-meeting basis, with their decisions depending on the implications of economic and financial developments for the prospects for labor markets and inflation."
"With respect to its objective of maximum employment, the Committee judged that, on balance, a range of labor market indicators suggested that underutilization of labor resources had diminished somewhat over the intermeeting period."
" Most members saw room for additional progress in reducing labor market slack , while a couple of members indicated that they viewed the unemployment rate as very close or essentially identical to its  mandateconsistent level ."
 Many expected that labor market underutilization would be largely eliminated around yearend if economic activity strengthened as they expected.
" However, some members were more uncertain about the extent of progress in the labor market to date or were concerned that if the pace of economic growth remained slow, labor market conditions might Minutes of the Meeting of June 16–17, 2015Page 9_____________________________________________________________________________________________improve only gradually."
Inflation had continued to run below the Committee’s 2 percent objective.
" Most members agreed that the recent stability in crude oil prices had increased their confidence that the downward pressure on inflation from earlier declines in energy prices was abating, and some noted the recent stability of the foreign exchange value of the dollar, which could eventually stem the decline in prices of imports."
" Marketbased measures of inflation compensation remained low, but they had risen some from their levels earlier in the year, and survey measures of inflation expectations continued to be stable."
" However, core inflation was still well below 2 percent."
 The Committee agreed to continue to monitor inflation developments closely.
" In considering the Committee’s  criteria for beginning policy normalization, all members but one indicated that they would need to see more evidence that economic growth was sufficiently strong and labor market conditions had firmed enough to return inflation to the Committee’s longer -run objective over the medium term; one member was already reasonably confident of such an outcome."
"The Committee concluded that, although it had seen some progress, the conditions warranting an increase in the target range for the federal funds rate had not yet been met, and that additional information on the outlook, particularly for labor markets and inflation, would be necessary before deciding to implement such an increase."
" It also decided to indicate the likelihood that energy prices might soon exert less downward influence on inflation, saying that energy prices appear ed to have stabilized, and to restate its expectation that inflation would rise gradually toward 2 percent over the medium term as the labor market improves further and the transitory effects of earlier declines in energy and import prices dissipate."
 The Committee agreed to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and to reaffirm in the statement that the Committee’s decision about how long to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate would depend on its assessment of actual and expected progress toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.
" Members continued to judge that their evaluation of progress on their objectives would take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
 Members agreed to retain the indication that the Committee anticipates that it will be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate when it has seen further improvement in the labor market and is reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term.
" The Committee agreed to reiterate its expectation that, even after employment and inflation are near mandateconsistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run."
"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: “Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster maximum employment and price stability."
 The System Open Market Account manager and the secretary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the System’s balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the Committee’s objectives of maximum employment and price stability.”  The vote encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p.m.: “Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in April suggests that economic activity has been expanding moderately after having changed little during the first quarter.
 The pace of job gains picked up while the unemployment rate remained steady.
" Growth in household spending has been moderate and the housing sector has shown some improvement; however, business fixed investment and net exports stayed soft."
" Inflation continued to run below the Committee’s longer -run objective, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and decreasing prices of nonenergy imports; energy prices appear to have stabilized."
 Marketbased measures of inflation compensation remain low; surveybased measures of longerterm inflation expectations have remained stable.
"Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
" The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, with labor market indicators continuing to move toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate."
 The Committee continues to see the risks to the outlook for economic activity and the labor market as nearly balanced.
" Inflation is anticipated to remain near its recent low level in the near term, but the Committee expects inflation to rise gradually toward 2 percent over the medium term as the labor market improves further and the transitory effects of earlier declines in energy and import prices dissipate."
 The Committee continues to monitor inflation developments closely.
"To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee today reaffirmed its view that the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate remains appropriate."
" In determining how long to maintain this target range, the Committee will assess progress —both realized and expected —toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation."
" This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
 The Committee anticipates that it will be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate when it has seen further improvement in the labor market and is reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term.
"When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longerrun goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent."
" The Committee currently anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near mandateconsistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run.”  Voting for this action:   Janet L."
"Madigan Secretary  Page 12Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________Summary of Economic Projections In conjunction with the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting held on June 16 –17, 2015, meeting participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real output growth, the unemployment rate, inflation, and the federal funds rate for each year from 2015 to 2017 and over the longer ru n.1 Each participant ’s projection was based on information available at the time of the meeting together with his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy and assumptions about the factors likely to affect economic ou tcomes."
" The longerrun projections represent each participant’s assessment of the value to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy."
 “Appropriate monetary policy” is defined as the future path of policy that each participant deems most likely to foster outcomes for economic activity and inflation that best satisfy his or her individual interpretation of the Federal Reserve’s objectives of maximum employment and stable prices.
" FOMC participants generally expected that, under appropriate monetary policy, growth of real gross domestic product (GDP) in 2015 would be somewhat below their individual estimates of the U.S. economy’s longer -run normal growth rate but would increase in 2016 before slowing to or toward its longerrun rate in 2017 (table 1 and figure 1)."
"  Participants generally expected that the unemployment rate would continue to decline in 2015 and 2016, and that the unemployment rate would be at or below their individual judgments of its longerrun normal level by the end of 2017."
" Participants anticipate d that inflation, as measured by the fourquarter percent change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), would be appreciably below 2 percent this year but expect ed it to step up next year, and a substantial majority of participants projected that inflation would be at or close to the Committee’s goal of 2 percent in 2017."
 The economic outlooks of individual participants implied that it likely would be appropriate to raise the target federal funds rate fairly gradually over the projection period in order to promote labor market conditions and inflation the Committee judges most conTable 1.

" Most participants continued to expect that it would be appropriate for the federal funds rate to stay appreciably below its longerrun level for some time after inflation and unemployment are near mandateconsistent levels, reflecting the effects of remaining headwinds holding back the economic expansion, and other factors."
Most participants viewed the uncertainty associated with their outlooks for economic growth and the unemployment rate as broadly similar to the average level of the past 20 years.
" Most participants also judged the level of uncertainty about inflation to be broadly similar to the average level of the past 20 years, although some participants viewed it as higher."
" In addition, most participants continued to see the risks to the outlook for economic growth and for the unemployment rate as broadly balanced, though some viewed the risks to economic growth as weighted to the downside."
" A majority of participants saw the risks to inflation as balanced; of the five who did not see inflation risks as balanced, four saw risks as tilted to the downside."
"The Outlook for Economic Activity Participants generally projected that, conditional on their individual assumptions about appropriate monetary policy, real GDP would grow slowly in the first half of 2015, but that this nearterm weakness would give way to growth in 2016 that exceeds their estimates of its longerrun normal rate; most participants expected real GDP growth to slow in 2017 to rates at or near their individual estimates of the longerrun rate."
" Participants generally regarded the weakness in economic activity in the first half of this year to be temporary and pointed to a number of factors that they expected would contribute to solid output growth through 2016, including improving labor market conditions, strengthened household and business balance sheets, waning effects of the earlier increases in the exchange value of the dollar, a boost to consumer spending from low energy prices, diminishing restraint from fiscal policy, and stillaccommodative monetary policy."
"Compared with their Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) contributions in March, all participants revised down their projections of real GDP growth for 2015, but many expected the economy to make up at least some of the shortfall over the remainder of the forecast period ."
"  The central tendencies of participants’ current projections for real GDP growth were 1.8 to 2.0 percent in 2015, 2.4 to 2.7 percent in 2016, and 2.1 to 2.5 percent in 2017."
 The central tendency of the projections of GDP growth in the longer run was unchanged from March at 2.0 to 2.3 percent.
"Most participants projected that the unemployment rate would continue to decline through 2016, and nearly all projected that by the fourth quarter of 2017, the unemployment rate would be at or below their individual judgments of its longerrun normal level."
" The central tendencies of participants’ forecasts for the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of each year were 5.2 to 5.3 percent in 2015, and 4.9 to 5.1 percent in both 2016 and 2017."
" Compared with the March SEP , participants’ projections for the unemployment rate edged up in 2015 but were little different over the medium term."
 Several participants indicated that the differences from their March projections for the unemployment rate over the medium term were modest in part because of the monetary policy response that they incorporated in to their forecasts to mitigate an otherwise weaker trajectory fo r expenditures.
Figures 3.A and 3.B show the distribution of participants’ views regarding the likely outcomes for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate through 2017 and in the longer run.
" Some of the diversity of views reflected participants’  individual assessments of a number of factors, including the effects of lower oil prices on consumer spending and business investment, the extent to which dollar appreciation would affect real activity, the rate at which the forces that have been restraining the pace of the economic recovery would continue to abate, the trajectory for growth in consumption as labor market slack diminishes, and the appropriate path of monetary policy."
"  Relative to the March SEP, the dispersion of participants’ projections for real GDP growth in 2015 narrowed considerably, reflecting in part the release of the national income and product accounts data for the first quarter of this year, which were not available when the FOMC met in March."
The Outlook for Inflation  All participants projected headline PCE inflation to come in at or below 1 percent this year —mostly due to the temporary effects of earlier declines in energy prices and decreases in nonenergy import prices —bu t to climb to 1½ percent or more in 2016.
 A sizable majority of participants expected that headline inflation would be at or close to the Committee’s goal in 2017.
 Most participants project ed only a slight decline in core PCE inflation this year and anticipated  a gradual rise over the remainder of the forecast period.

" The central tendencies for PCE inflation were 0.6 to 0.8 percent in 2015, 1.6 to 1.9 percent in 2016, and 1.9 to 2.0 percent in 2017; for core PCE inflation, the central tendencies were 1.3 to 1.4 percent in 2015, 1.6 to 1.9 percent in 2016, and 1.9 to 2.0 percent in 2017."
" Factors cited by participants as likely to contribute t o inflation rising toward 2 percent included stable longerterm inflation expectations, steadily diminishing resource slack, a pickup in wage growth, the waning effects of declines in energy prices, and stillaccommodative monetary policy."
  Figures 3.C and 3.D provide information on the distribution of participants’ views about the outlook for inflation.
" The range of projections for PCE inflation in 201 5 narrowed, albeit mostly on the basis of the lowering of just one projection; otherwise, the ranges of participants’ projections for both headline and core PCE inflation were nearly identical to what was reported in March."
  Appropriate Monetary Policy Participants judged that it would be appropriate to begin normalization of monetary policy as labor market indicators and inflation moved to or toward values the Committee regards as consistent with the attainment of its mandated objectives of maximum employment and price stability.
"All but a few participants projected that the unemployment rate would be at or somewhat above their estimates of its longerrun normal level at the end of the year in which they judged the initial increase in the target range for the federal funds rate would be warranted, and all participants projected that unemployment would decline further after the commencement of normalization."
"  All participants projected that inflation would be below the Committee’s 2 percent objective that year , but they also saw inflation rising notably closer to 2 percent in the following year."
 Participants provided a number of reasons why they thought it would be appropriate for the federal funds rate to remain below its longerrun normal level for some time after inflation and the unemployment rate were near mandateconsistent levels.
" These reasons included the expectation that headwinds that have been holding back the recovery would continue to exert some restraint on economic activity , that weak real activity abroad and t he recent appreciation of the dollar were likely to persist and temper spending and production in the United States , that residual slack in the labor market would still be evident in some measures of labor utilization other than the unemployment rate, and that the risks to the economic outlook were asymmetric in part because of the constraints on monetary policy associated with the effective lower bound on the federal funds rate."
"Participant s’ views of the appropriate path for monetary policy were informed by their judgments about the state of the economy, including their estimates of the values of the unemployment rate and other labor market indicators that would be consistent with maximum employment, the extent to which labor market conditions were currently perceived to be falling short of maximum employment, and the prospects for inflation to return to the Committee’s longer -term objective of 2 percent over the medium term."

" tic economy, the uncertainty regarding the reaction by economic decisionmakers to the beginning of policy normalization after a lengthy period with the federal funds rate at the effective lower bound, the economic benefits of limiting any associated disruptions in financial markets, and a general desire to practice risk management in setting monetary policy."
" In addition, some participants mentioned the prescriptions of various monetary policy rules as factors they considered in judging the appropriate path for the federal funds rate."
"Uncertainty and Risks A large majority of participants continued to judge the levels of  uncertainty  attendi ng their projections for real                                                  2 Table 2 provides estimates of the forecast uncertainty for the change in real GDP, the unemployment rate, and total consumer price inflation over the period from 1995 through 2014."
"GDP growth and the unemployment rate as broadly similar to the norms of the previous 20 years (figure 4).2  As in March, most participants saw the risks to their outlooks for real GDP growth as broadly balanced, although some participants again viewed the risks to real GDP growth as weighted to the downside."
" Those participants who viewed the risks as weighted to the downside cited, for example, concern about the limited ability of monetary policy to respond to negativ e shocks to the economy when the federal funds rate is at its effective lower bound , a fragile foreign economic outlook, and weak readings on productivity growth."
 A large majority of participants judged the risks to the outlook for the unemployment rate to be broadly balanced.
Participants generally agreed that the levels of uncertainty associated with their inflation forecasts were broadly similar to historical norms.
 A few policymakers indicated that their confidence in the likelihood of inflation moving toward the policy objective of 2 percent inflation had increased.
" In all, 11 participants viewed the risks to their inflation forecast as balanced , up from 8 in the March SEP."
" The risks were still seen as tilted to the downside by 5 participants who cit ed the possibility that the effects of the high exchange value of the dollar on domestic inflation could persist for longer than anticipated, that longerterm inflation expectations might coalesce on a lower level of inflation than assumed , or that , in current circumstances, it could be difficult for the Committee to respond effectively to lowinflation outcomes."
" Conversely, 1 participant saw risks to inflation as weighted to the upside, citing uncertainty about the timing and efficacy of the Committee’s  withdrawal of monetary policy accommodation."

"Table 2 summarizes the average historical accuracy of a range of forecasts, including those reported in past Monetary Policy Report s and those prepared by the Federal Reserve Board ’s staff in advance of meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee."
 The corresponding 70 percent confidence intervals for overall inflation would be 1.2 to 2.8  percent in the current year and 1.0 to 3.0 percent in the second and third years.
" As with real activity and inflation, the outlook for the future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable uncertainty."
 This uncertainty arises primarily because each participant’s assessment of the appropriate stance of monetary policy depends importantly on the evolution of real activity and inflation over time.
