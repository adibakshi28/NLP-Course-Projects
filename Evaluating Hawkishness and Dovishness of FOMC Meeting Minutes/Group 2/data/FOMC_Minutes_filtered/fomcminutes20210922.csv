 The spread of the Delta variant of the COVID19 virus weighed on the nearterm growth outlook and median respondents to the Open Market Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers marked down projections for gross domestic product (GDP) growth and revised up projections for inflation this year.
" Nonetheless, expectations for the tr ajectory of growth beyond 2021 were little changed."
 Implied forward inflation compensation two to four years ahead based on Treasury InflationProtected Securities (TIPS) increased modestly over the intermeeting period.
"   Regarding the outlook for monetary policy, market participants noted policymaker communications suggesting that tapering of asset purchases could begin this year and end by mid2022."
 Expectations for the target federal funds rate based on survey responses and interest rate futures moved up slightly since the previous meeting.
" In Latin America and emerging Europe, some central banks recently tightened policy to address rising inflation pressures."
"In light of increased usage of the ON RRP facility and the potential for continued downward pressure on shortterm interest rates over the near term, the manager next discussed a staff proposal to increase the percounterparty limit for the ON RRP facility to $160 billion."
 Consumer price inflation in June and July—as measured by the 12month percentage change in the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index—was elevated.
"Total nonfarm payroll employment increased sharply in July but rose much less rapidl y in August, with job gains in the leisure and hospitality sector slowing to zero."
" In addition, state and local government employment was reported to have fallen in August, though abnormal seasonal swings had likely distorted recent readings for this sector."
" As of August, total payroll employment had retraced threefourths of the losses seen at the onset of the pandemic."
" The unemployment rate had declined from 5.9 percent in June to 5.2 percent in August; although the unemployment rates for African Americans and Hispanics had also declined, on net, over this period, both rates remained well above the national average."
" The labor force participation rate edged up, on net, and the employmentto-population (EPOP) ratio rose further in July and August."
" Privatesector job openings, as measured by the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, increased further in July an d continued to suggest that labor demand was extraordinarily high."
 Initial claims for regular state unemployment insurance remained near the pandemicperiod low that had been reached in early September but were still somewhat elevated relative to prepandemic levels.
 Weekly estimates of privatesector payrolls constructed by the Board’s staff using data provided by the payroll processor ADP that were available through early September pointed to a modest pickup in the pace of private employment gains relative to August.
" A staff measure of the 12month change in the median wage derived from the ADP data had also pointed to strong wage growth, with a pace in August Minutes of the Meeting of September 21–22, 2021Page 3_____________________________________________________________________________________________that was well above the growth rates seen before the pandemic."
" By contrast, the Wage Growth Tracker measure constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta had not shown a similar pickup."
" The employment cost index of hourly compensation in the private sector, which also includes benefit costs, rose at an annual rate of 3.6 percent over the 6 months ending in June, 1 percentage point faster than the 12month change posted in December 2020."
"Inflation, as measured by either the PCE price index or the consumer price index (CPI), had been boosted by a surge in demand as the economy reopened further, along with the effects of production bottlenecks and supply constraints."
" Total PCE price inflation was 4.2 percent over the 12 months ending in July, and core PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in consumer energy prices and many consumer food prices, was 3.6 percent over the 12 months ending in  July."
" In contrast, the trimmed mean measure of 12month PCE inflation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas was 2.0 percent in July."
" In the third quarter of 2021, the staff’s common inflation expectations index, which combines information from ma ny indicators of inflation expectations and inflation compensation, was little changed relative to the second quarter and was near its average over the decade before the pandemic."
" However, concerns about the course of the pandemic appeared to be weighing on consumer services spending, as available indicators pointed to a slowing in demand for services sensitive to social distancing."
" Demand for housing appeared to have remained very strong, but incoming data suggested that materials shortages and a lack of developed lots for construction were restraining residential building activity."
Available indicators suggested  that growth in business fixed investment was slowin g somewhat in the third quarter as supply bottlenecks—particularly for motor vehicles—weighed on business equipment spending.
The U.S. international trade deficit remained high in July.
"In the advanced foreign economies (AFEs), where high vaccination rates had increased resilience to COVID19 outbreaks, incoming data were consistent with economic growth in the third quarter at a slightly faster pace than in the second quarter."
"Inflation abroad was elevated, reflecting reversals of price declines early in the pandemic, past increases in energy and commodity prices, upward pressures from supply bottlenecks, and past exch ange rate depreciations in some EMEs. Staff Review of the Financial Situation Financial market prices were little changed over the intermeeting period."
"Yields on intermediatematurity Treasury securities increased modestly, on net, amid mixed news on economic activity and the pandemic, an d slightly lessaccommoda-tivethan-expected July FOMC communications."
"Measures of inflation compen sation declined modestly, on net."
  Foreign asset prices fluctuated moderately over the intermeeting period as market participants continued to assess the effect of the Delta variant on global growth and inflation.
" In the euro area and the United Kingdom, higherthan-expected inflation data contributed to the rise in yields and inflation compensation measures."
" Small business loan originations were above prepandemic levels in June and July, Minutes of the Meeting of September 21–22, 2021Page 5_____________________________________________________________________________________________but in creased concerns about the Delta variant depressed loan demand in August."
 CRE loan growth at banks strengthened and issuance of commercial mortgagebacked securities (CMBS) remained robust over the summer.
 Auto loan growth slowed in June and July from its brisk pace in May.
Staff Economic Outlook The projection for U.S. economic activity prepared by the staff for the September FOMC meeting was broadly similar to the July projection.
" Even so, real GDP was expected to post a sizable gain over the second half of 2021 and over the year as a whole, resulting in a correspondingly large decline in the unemployment rate."
" With the boost from these factors fading, real GDP growth was projected to step down noticeably in 2023 and to be roughly equal to  potential output growth in 2023 and 2024."
" However, the level of real GDP was expected to remain well above potential throughout the projection period, resulting in a decline in the unemployment rate to histor ically low levels."
"The staff’s nearterm outlook for inflation was revised up further in response to incoming data, but the staff continued to expect that this year’s rise in inflation would prove to be transitory."
" The 12month change in total and core PCE prices was well above 2 percent in July, and available data suggested that PCE price inflation had remained high in August."
" The staff interpreted recent inflation data as indicating that supply constraints were putting a larger amount of upward pressure on prices than previously anticipated; relative to the July projection, these supply cons traints were also expected to take longer to resolve."
" PCE price inflation was therefore expected to step down to a little below 2 percent in 2022; thereafter, additional incr eases in resource utilization were expected to cause it to gradually edge higher and to reach 2 percent in 2024."
The staff continued to judge that the risks to the baseline projection for economic activity were skewed to the downside.
"The staff also continued to judge that the risks around the inflation projection were tilted to the upside, with the possibility of more severe and persistent supply issues viewed as especially salient."
" In addition, the staff pointed to a risk that longerrun inflation expectations would move appreciably higher and lead to persistently elevated inflation."
"Participants’ Views on Current Economic Conditions and the Economic Outlook In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2021 through 202 4 and over the  longer run based on their individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy, including the path of the federal funds rate."
" The longerrun projections represented each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each Page 6Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________variable woul d be expe cted to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy."
"In their discussion of current conditions, participants noted that, with progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment had continued to strengthen."
" Inflation was elevated, largely reflecting transitory factors."
"Participants observed that economic activity had continued to expand in recent months, though at a less rapid pace than in the first half of the year."
" They marked down their projections of real GDP growth for the year, pointing to a reassessment of the severity and likely duration of supply constraints or of the effects of the spread of the Delta variant on the economy."
" Still, participants foresaw rapid growth this year, and several highlighted that the economy had shown resilience in the face of the recent wave of infections."
" Nonetheless, participants expected the accumulated stock of savings, the release of pentup demand, and progress on vaccinations to continue to support household spending in coming months."
"With respect to the busine ss sector, participants observed that firms in a number of industries were facing challenges keeping up with strong demand due to widespread supply chain bottlen ecks as well as labor shortages."
" The unemployment rate declined further to  5.2 percent in August, and a few participants noted a further pickup in recent months in the level of activity indicator in the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City’s Labor Market Conditions Indicators."
" After a rapid pace of almost 1 million per month in June and July, job gains slowed to 235,000 in August as the resurgence of COVID19 cases weighed on employment in highcontact service sectors, particularly in the leisure and hospi tality sector."
" Some participants noted that the in crease in labor force participation that they had expected had not yet materialized in the wake of the reopening of schools and the expiration of the extended unemployment benefits, and that this likely reflected in part concerns about the resurgence of the virus, childcare challenges, and the uncertainties generated by ongoing disruptions to inperson schooling."
 Several participants indicated that a rise in the labor force participation rate might lag the improvements in other indicators such as the unemployment rate—a pattern consistent with past business cycle recoveries.
"The rate of nominal wage growth had been robust in recent data; for example, average hourly earnings were up 4.9 percent at an annualized rate over the past six months."
"  In their discussion of inflation, participants observed that the inflation rate was elevated, and they expected that it would likely remain so in coming months before moderating."
" Participants marked up their inflation projections, as they assessed that supply constraints in product and labor markets were larger and likely to be longer lasting than previously antici pated."
 Some participants expressed concerns that elevated rates of inflation could feed through into longerterm inflation expectations of households and businesses or saw recent inflation data as suggestive of broader inflation pressures.
" Several other participants pointed out that the largest contributors to the recent elevated measures of inflation were a handful of COVIDrelated, pandemicsensitive categories in which specific, identifiable bottlenecks were at play."
 This observation suggested that the upward pressure on prices would abate as the COVIDrelated demand and supply imbalances subsided.
" A few participants noted that there was not yet evidence that robust wage growth was exerting upward pressure on prices to a significant degree, but also that the possibility merited close monitoring."
" In their comments on inflation expectations, several participants observed that measures of longerterm inflation expectations, includin g TIPSand surveybased measures, had remained in ranges that were viewed as broadly consistent with the Committee’s longerrun inflation goal, or that the distribution across households of longerterm expected inflation had remained stable over the past two years."
 Many participants noted the substantial rise in oneand threeyear measures of inflation expectations in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Survey of Consumer Expectations or in the oneyear measure in the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers.
" A few participants remarked that these survey measures tended to be sensitive to movements in actual inflation, or that the recent rise was consistent with previous historical relationships between such measures and actual inflation."
 Participants generally saw the risks to the outlook for economic activity as broadly balanced.
 Most participants saw inflation risks as weighted to th e upside because of concerns that supply disruptions and labor shortages might last longer and might have larger or more persistent effects on prices and wages than they currently assumed.
" A few participants commented that there were also some downside risks for inflation, as the factors that had held inflation down over the previous long expansion were likely still in place."
"In their consideration of the stance of monetary policy, participants reaffirmed th e Federal Reserve’s commitment to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. Page 8Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________economy during this challenging time, thereby promoting the Committee’s statutory goals of maximum employment and price stability."
 Participants judged that the current stance of monetary policy remained appropriate to promote maximum employment as well as to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time and longerterm inflation expectations that are well anchored at 2 percent.
 Participants also reiterated that the existing outcomebased guidance implied that the paths of the federal funds rate and the balance sheet would depend on actual progress toward reaching the Committee’s maximumemployment an d inflation goals.
"Participants resumed their discussions on the progress made toward the Committee’s goals since December 2020, when the Committee ad opted its guidance regarding asset purchases and indi cated that purchases would continue at their current pace until substantial further progress had been made toward the Committee’s goals of maximum employment and price stability."
"With regard to the Committee’s maximumemployment goal, participants considered the cumulative degree of improvement in the labor ma rket since December 2020."
"In doing so, participants cite d the progress recorded in a number of individual series, including, among others, the employmentto-population ratio, the unemployment rate, claims for unemployment insurance, job openings, nominal wage growth, and increases in payrolls, as well as in summary measures of the labor situation."
" A number of participants assessed that the standard of substantial further progress toward the goal of maximum employment had not yet been attained but that, if the economy proceeded roughly as they anticipated, it may soon be reached."
" On the basis of the cumulative performance of the labor market since December 2020, a number of other participants indicated that they believed that the test of “substantial further progress” toward maximum employment had been met."
 Some of these participants also suggested that labor supply constraints were the main impediments to further improvement in labor market conditi ons rather than lack of demand.
 They noted that adding monetary policy accommodation at this time would not address such constraints or that the costs of continuing asset purchases might be beginning to exceed their benefits.
" With regard to inflation, upside risks cited included the possibility that elevated levels of inflation would continue for longer than expected, especially if labor and other supply shortages proved more persistent than currently anticipated, or that longerterm inflation expectations might move above levels consistent with the Committee’s longerterm inflation objective of 2 percent."
 Downside risks to inflation included the possibility of a decline in infl ation expectations that might occur if the public misconstrued the Federal Reserve’s reaction function as less accommodative than it actually was.
" Several participants expressed concern that the high degree of accommodation being provided by monetary policy, including through continued asset purchases, could increase risk s to financial stability."
Participants reaffirmed that the Committee’s “substantial further progress” standard regarding its asset purchases was distinct from the criteria given in its forward guidance on the federal funds rate and that a policy shift toward a moderation of asset purchases provided no direct signal about its interest rate policy.
" In addition to noting that the economy was still well below maximum employment, several of these participants suggested that there would likely be sustained downward pressure on inflation in the years ahead."
"These participants stated that,  in such circumstances, a major challenge facing policymakers—especially in the presence of the effective lower bound on the federal funds rate—was to maintain a policy stance sufficiently accommodative to keep average inflation at 2 percent and thereby bolster the cred ibility of the Committee’s new policy framework, facilitating the achievement of both maximum employment and price stability."
" In contrast, a number of participants raised the possibility of beginning to increase the target range by the end of next year because they expected that the labor market and inflation outcomes specified in the Committee’s guidance on the federal funds rate might be achieved by that time; some of these participants saw inflation as likely to remain elevated in 2022 with risks to the upside."
"  Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that with progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment had continue d to strengthen."
" Inflation was elevated, largely reflecting transitory factors."
"Members agreed that the Federal Reserve was committed to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum employment and price stability goals."
" All members reaffirmed that, in  accordance with the Committee’s goals to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run, and with inflation having run pers istently below this longerrun goal, they would aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longerterm inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent."
 Members expected to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until those outcomes were achieved.
"All members agreed to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent, and they expected that it would be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions had reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessments of maximum employment and inflation had risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time."
" Last December, the Committee indicated that it would continue to increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least Page 10Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________$80 billion per month and of agency M BS by at least $40 billion per month until su bstantial further progress has been made toward its maximum employment and price stability goals."
"Members agreed that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and that they would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate in the event that risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals."
" Members also concurred that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments."
"Members agreed that the postmeeting statement should acknowledge the slowing of the economic recovery, as indicated in data received since the July meeting, as well as ongoing elevated inflation readings."
" In light of these developments, they agreed that the Committee should indicate that the sectors of  the economy most adversely affected by the pandemic had improved in recent months but that the rise in COVID19 cases had slowed their recovery, and they also concurred that it would be appropriate to characterize inflation as being “elevated” in place of stating that infl ation had “risen.”  Members further decided to add to the postmeeting statement an indication that if progress toward the maximumemploy-ment and pricestability goal s continued broadly as expected, the Committee judged that a moderation in the pace of asset purchases may soon be warranted."
"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct  the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the following domestic policy directive, for release at 2:00 p.m.: “Effective September 23, 2021, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to: Undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate ina target range of 0 to ¼ percent.Increase the System Open Market Accountholdings of Treasury securities by $80 billion per month and of agency mortgagebacked securities (MBS) by $40 billion permonth.Increase holdings of Treasury securities andagency MBS by additional amounts andpurchase agency commercial mortgagebacked securities (CMB S) as needed to sustain smooth functioning of markets forthese securities.Conduct overnight repurchase agreementoperations with a minimum bid rate of0.25 percent and with an aggregate operation limit of $500 billion; the aggregate operation limit can be temporarily increased atthe discretion of the Chair.Conduct overnight reverse repurchaseagreement operations at an offering rate of0.05 percent and with a percounterpartylimit of $16 0 billion per day; the percounterparty limit can be temporarily increased at the discretion of the Chair.Roll over at auction all principal paymentsfrom the Federal Reserve’s holdings ofTreasury securities and reinvest all principalpayments from the Federal Reserve’s holdi n g s  o f  a g e n c y  d e b t  a n d  a g e n c y  M B S  i nagency MBS.Allow modest deviations from statedamounts for purchases and reinvestments,if needed for operational reasons.Engage in dollar roll and coupon swaptransactions as necessary  to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserv e’s agency MBStransactions.”The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2:00 p.m.: Minutes of the Meeting of September 21–22, 2021Page 11_____________________________________________________________________________________________“The Federal Reserv e is committed to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time , thereby promoting its maximum employment and price stability goals."
"With progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have continued to strengthen."
" Inflation is elevated, largely reflecting transitory factors."
The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run.
" With inflation having run persistently below this longerrun goal, the Committee will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer‑term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent."
 The Committee expects to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomes are achieved.
The Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessments of maximum  employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.
"Last December, the Committee indicated that it would continue to increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency mortgage ‑backed securities by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward its maximum employment and price stability goals."
"In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of in coming information for the economic outlook."
 The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals.
" The Committee’s assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financia l and international developments.” Voting for this action:   Jerome H."
"Consistent with the Committee’s decision to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the Board voted unanimously to maintain the interest rate paid on reserve balances at 0.15 percent, effective September 23, 2021."
