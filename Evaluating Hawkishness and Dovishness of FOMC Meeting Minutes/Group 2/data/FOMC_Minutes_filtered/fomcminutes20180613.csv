" However, principal payments on agency MBS are sensitive to changes in various factors, parti cularly longterm interest rates ."
" Consumer price inflation, as measured by the 12 -month percentage change in the price index for personal consumption ex penditures (PCE), was 2  percent in April."
 Survey -based measures of longer -run inflation expectations were little changed on balance.
" Total nonfarm payroll employment expanded at a strong pace, on average, in April and May."
 The national unemployment rate edged down in both months and was 3.8 percent in May.
" The unemployment rates for African Americans, Asians, and Hispanics all declined, on net, from March to May; the rate for African Americans was the lowest on record but still noticeably above the rates for other groups."
" The rate of private -sector job openings rose in March and stayed at that elevated level in April; the rate of quits edged up , on net, over those two months; and initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits cont inued to be low through early June."
" Al though light motor vehicle sales declined in May, indicators of vehicle demand generally remained upbeat."
" More broadly, recent readings on key factors that influence consumer spending—including gains in employment, real disposable personal income, and households’ net worth—continued to be supportive of solid real PCE growth in the near term."
" Net exports made a negligible contribution to real GDP growth in the first quarter, with growth of both real exports and real imports slowing from the brisk pace of the fourth quarter of last year."
" After narrowing in March, the nominal trade deficit narrowed further in April, as exports continued to increase while imports declined slightly, which suggested that net exports might add modestly to real GDP growth in the second quarter."
" Core PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in consumer food and energy prices, was 1.8 percent over that same period."
" The consumer price index (CPI) rose 2.8 percent over the 12  months ending in May, while core CPI inflation was 2.2 percent."
" Recent readings on survey -based measures of longer -run inflation expectations —including those from the Michigan survey, the Survey of Professional Forecasters, and the Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants —were little changed on balance."
 Incoming data suggested that foreign economic activity continued to expand at a solid pace.
" Real GDP growth picked up in the first quarter in several EMEs —including Mexico, China, and much of emerging Asia —although recent indicators pointed to some moderation in the pace of activity in most EMEs.  By contrast, in the advanced foreign economies (AFEs), real GDP growth slowed in the first quarter, owing partly to temporary factors such as labor strikes in some European countries and bad weather in Japan."
 More  recent indicators pointed to a partial rebound in AFE economic growth in the second quarter.
" Inflation pressures in the foreign economies generally remained subdued, even though higher oil prices put some upward pressure on headline inflation."
" Staff Review of the Financial Situation  During the intermeeting period, gl obal financial markets were buffeted by increased concerns about the outlook for foreign growth and political developments in Italy, but these concerns subsequently eased."
" Meanwhile, financing conditions for nonfinancial businesses and households remained supportive of economic activity on balance."
" Over the intermeeting period, macroeconomic data releases signaling moderating growth in some foreign economies, along with downside r isks stemming from political developments in Italy and several EMEs, weighed on prices of foreign risk assets."
" The dollar appreciated notably against several EME currencies (primarily those of Argentina, Turkey, Mexico, and Brazil), as the increase in U.S. interest rates since late 2017, along with political developments  and other issues , intensified concerns about financial vulnerabilities."
 M easures of inflation compensation derived from Treasury Inflation -Protected Securities were also little changed on net.
" Broad U.S. equity price indexes increased about 5 percent, on net, since the May FOMC meeting, boosted in part by the stronger -thanexpected May Employment Situation report."
Growth of outstanding commercial and industrial loans held by banks appeared to have moderated in May after a strong reading in April.
" Even so, the growth of CRE loans held by banks ticked down in April and May."
" Growth in home -purchase mortgages slowed a bit and refinancing activity continued to be muted in recent months, with both developments partly reflecting the rise in mortgage rates earlier this year."
" Financing conditions in consumer credit markets were little changed in the first few months of 2018, on balance, and remained largely supportive of growth in household spending."
" Growth in consumer credit slowed a bit in the first quarter, as seasonally adjusted credit card balances were about flat after having surged in the fourth quarter of last year."
" Over the 2018 –20 period, output was projected to rise further above the  staff’s estimate of its potential, and the unemployment rate was projected to decline further below the staff’s estimate of its longer -run natural rate."
" Relative to the forecast prepared for the May meeting, the projection for real GDP growth beyond the first half of 2018 was revised down a little in response to a higher assumed path for the exchange value of the dollar."
" In addition, the staff continued to anticipate that supply constraints might restrain output growth somewhat."
" With real GDP rising a l ittle less, on balance, over the forecast period, the projected decline in the unemployment rate over the next few years was a touch smaller than in the previous forecast."
 The staff forecast for total PCE price inflation from 2018 to 2020 was not revised  materially .
" Total consumer price inflation over the first half of 2018 appeared to be a little lower than in the previous projection, mainly because of slightly softer incoming data on nonmarket prices, but the forecast for the second half of the year was a little higher, reflecting an upward revision to projected consumer energy prices over the next couple of quarters."
" The staff continued to project that total PCE inflation would remain near the Committee’s 2  percent objective over the medium term and tha t core PCE price inflation would run slightly higher than total inflation Minutes of the Meeting of June 12–13, 2018Page 5_____________________________________________________________________________________________    over that period because of  a projected decline in consumer energy prices in 2019 and 2020."
"The staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as similar to the average of the past 20 years."
 The staff saw the risks to the forecasts for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate as balanced.
 Risks to the inflation projection also were seen as balanced.
 The upside risk that inflation could increase more than expected in an economy that was projected to move further above its potential was counterbalanced by the downside risk that longer -term inflation expectations may be lower than was assumed in the staff forecast.
" Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook  In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, members of the Board  of Governors and Federal Reserve Bank presidents submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2018 through 2020 and over the longer run, based on their individual asse ssments of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate."
" The longer -run projections represented each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy."
" In their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants  agreed that information received since the FOMC met in May indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising at a solid rate."
" Recent data suggested that growth of household spending had picked up, while business fixed investment had continued to grow strongly."
" On a 12 -month basis, overall inflation and core inflation , which excludes  changes in food and ene rgy prices, had both moved close to 2  percent."
" Indicators of longer -term inflation expectations were little changed, on balance."
" Participants viewed recent readings on spending, employment, and inflation as suggesting little change, on balance, in their assessments of the economic outlook."
" Incoming data suggested that GDP growth strengthened  in the second quarter of this year, as growth of consumer spending picked up after slowing  earlier in the  year."
" Participants noted a number of favorable economic factors  that were supporting above -trend GDP growth; these included a strong labor market, stimulative federal tax and spending policies, accommodative financial conditions, and continued high levels of household and business confidence."
" They also generally  expected that further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would be consistent with sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee ’s symmetric 2 percent objective over  the medium term."
" Participants reported that business fixed investment had continued to expand at a strong  pace in recent months, supported in part by substantial investm ent growth in the energy sector."
" Nonfarm payroll employment posted strong gains in recent months, averaging more than 200,000 per month this year."
" The unemployment rate fell to 3.8  percent in Page 6Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________    May, below the estimate of each participant who submitted a longer -run projection ."
" With economic growth anticipated to remain above trend, participants generally expected the unemployment rate to remain below , or decline further below , their estimates of its longer -run normal rate."
" Several  participants, however, suggested that there may be less tightness in the labor market than implied by the unemployment rate alone, because there was further  scope for a strong labor market to continue to draw individuals into the workforce."
" A number of participants noted that, w ith the unemployment rate expected to remain below estimates of its longer -run normal rate, they anticipated wage inflation  to pick up further."
" The recent large increases in consumer energy prices had  pushed up total PCE price inflation relative to the core measure, and this divergence  was expected to continue  in the near term, resulting in a temporary increase in overall inflation above the Committee’s 2  percent longer -run objective."
"  In general, participants viewed recent price developments as consistent with their expectation that inflation was on a trajectory to achieve the Committee’s symmetric 2  percent objective on a sustained basis , although a number of participants noted that it was premature to conclude that the Committee had achieved that objective ."
" The generally favorable outlook for inflation  was buttressed by reports from business contacts in several Districts suggesting some  firming of inflationary  pressures ; for exampl e, many business contacts indicated that they were  experiencing rising input costs , and, in some cases , firms appeared to be passing these cost increases through to consumer  price s."
" Although core inflation and the 12 -month trimmed mean PCE inflation rate calculated by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas remained a little  below 2 percent, many  participants anticipated that  high levels of resource utilization and stable inflation expectations would keep overall inflation near 2  percent over the medium term."
" In light of inflation having run below the Committee’s 2  percent objective for the past several years, a few participants cautioned that measures of longer -run inflation expectations derived from financial market data remained somewhat below levels consistent with the Co mmittee’s 2  percent objective ."
" Accordingly, in their view, investors appeared to judge the expected  path of inflation as running a bit below 2 percent  over the medium run."
 Some  participants  raised the concern  that a prolonged period in which the economy operate d beyond potential could give rise to heightened inflationary pressure s or to financial imbalances that could lead eventually to a significant economic downturn.
"  Participants commented on a number of risks and uncertainties associated with their outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation over the medium term."
" Participants generally  continued to see recent fiscal policy changes as supportive of ec onomic growth over the next few years , and a few indicated  that fiscal policy posed  an upside risk."
 Many participants saw potential downside risks to economic growth and inflation associated with political and economic developments in Europe and some EMEs .
Meeting participants also discussed the term structure of interest rates and what a flattening of the yield curve might signal about economic activity going forward.
" Participants pointed to a number of factors , other than the gradual rise of the federal funds rate, that could contribute to a reduction in the spread between long -term and shortterm Treasury yields , including a reduction in investors’ estimates of the longer -run neutral real interest rate ; lower longer -term inflation expectations ; or a lower level of term premiums in recent years relative to historical experience  reflecting, in part, central bank asset purchases ."
" Some  participants noted that such factors might temper the reliability of the slope of the yield curve as an indicator of future economic activity; however, several others expressed doubt about whether such factors were distorting  the information content of the yield curve ."
"In their consideration of monetary policy  at this meet ing, participants generally agreed that  the economic expansion was progressing roughly as anticipated , with real economic activity expanding  at a solid rate, labor market conditions  continuing to strengthen, and inflation near the Committee’s objective."
" These participants agreed that, even after such an increase in the target range, the stance of monetary policy would remain accommodative, supporting strong labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation."
"  One participant remarked  that, with inflation having run consistently below 2  percent in recent years  and market -based measures of inflation compensation still low, postponing an increase in the target range for the federal funds rate would help push inflation expectations up to levels consistent with  the Committee’s objective."
" With regard to the mediumterm outlook for monetary policy, participants generally judged that, with the economy already very strong and  inflation expected to run at 2 percent on a sustained basis over the medium term, it would likely be appropriate to continue gradually raising the target range for the federal funds rate to a setting that was at or somewhat above  their esti mates of its longer -run level by 2019 or 2020."
" Participants pointed to  various reasons for raising short -term interest rates gradually , including the uncertainty surrounding the level of the federal funds rate in the longer run , the lags with which changes in monetary policy affect the e conomy , and the potential constraints on adjustments in the target range for the federal funds rate in response to adverse shocks when shortterm interest rates are low."
" In addition, a  few participants saw survey - or marketbased indicators  as suggesting that inflation expectations were not yet firmly anchored at a level consistent with the Committee’s objective."
 A few also  noted that a temporary period of inflation modestly above 2 percent could be helpful in anchoring longer -run inflation expectations at a level consistent with the Committee’s symmetric objective.
 Participants offered their views about how much additional policy firming would likely be required to sustainably achieve the Committee’s objectives of maximum employment and 2  percent inflation.
" In that regard , participants discussed how the Committee’s communications might evolve over coming meetings if the economy progressed about as anticipated; in particular, a number of them noted that it might soon be appropriate to modify the language in the postmeeting statement indicating that “the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative.”  Participants supported a plan to implement a technical adjustment to the IOER rate that would place it at a level 5 basis points  below  the top of the FOMC’s target range for the federal funds rate."
" A few participants suggested that, before too long, the Committee might want to further discuss how it can implement monetary policy most effectively and efficiently when the quantity of reserve balances reaches a level appreciably below that seen recently ."
"Committee Policy Action  In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that information received since the FOMC met in May indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising  at a solid rate."
" Job gains had been strong, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate had declined."
" Recent data suggested that growth of household spending had picked up, while business fixed investment had continued to grow strongly."
" On a  12month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy had moved close to 2 percent."
" Indicators of longer -term inflation expectations were little changed, on balance."
" They judged that continuing along a path of gradual  policy firming would balance the risk  of moving too quickly, which could leave inflation s hort of a sustained return to the Committee’s symmetric goal, against the risk of moving too slowly, which could lead to a buildup of inflation pressures or material financial imbalances."
"  Consequently, members expected that further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would  be consistent with sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee ’s symmetric 2  percent objective over the medium term."
" After assessing current conditions and the outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, members voted to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 1¾ to 2 perce nt."
" They indicated that the  stance of monetary policy remained  accommodative, thereby supporting strong labor market conditi ons and a sustained return to 2  percent inflation."
 Members agreed that th e timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate  would depend upon their assessment of  realized and expected eco nomic conditions relative to the Committee’s  maxim um employment objective and symmetric 2  percent inflation objective.
" They reiterated that th is assessment w ould take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
" The Committee also directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve’s agency mortgage -backed securities transactions.”  Minutes of the Meeting of June 12–13, 2018Page 9_____________________________________________________________________________________________    The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00  p.m.: “Information received since  the Federal Open Market Committee met in May indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising at a solid rate."
" Job gains have been strong, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has d eclined."
" Recent data suggest that growth of household spending has picked up, while business fixed investment has continued to grow strongly."
" On a 12 -month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy have moved close to 2 percent."
" Indicators of longer -term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance."
" Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
" The Committee expects that further gradual increas es in the target range for the federal funds rate will be consistent with sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee’s symmetric 2  percent objective over the medium term."
" In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 1¾ to 2  percent."
" The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting strong labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation."
"In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected econom ic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2  percent inflation objective."
" This vote  also encompassed approval by the Board of Governors of the establishment of a 2½ p ercent primary credit rate by the remaining Federal Reserve Bank, effective on the later of June 14, 2018, and the date such Reserve Bank information,  including  measures of  labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pr essures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.”  Voting for this action:   Jerome H."
" To support the Committee’s decision to raise the target range for the federal funds rate, the Board of Governors voted unanimously to raise the interest rates on required and excess reserve balances to 1.95 percent, effective June 14, 2018."
" (Secretary’s note: Subsequently, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was informed by the Secretary of the Board of the Board’s approval of their establishment of a primary credit rate of 2½  percent, effective June 14, 2018.)  The seco nd vote of the Board also encompassed approval of the establishment of the interest rates for secondary and seasonal credit under the existing formulas for computing such rates."
" Page 10Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________    Summary of Economic Projections In conjunction with the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting held on June 12 –13, 2018, meeting participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real gross domestic product (GDP) growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2018 to 2020 and over the longer run.1  Each participant’s projections were based on information available at the time of the meeting, together with his or her assessment of appr opriate monetary policy —including a path for the federal funds rate and its longer -run value —and assumptions about other factors likely to affect economic outcomes."
" The longer -run projections represent each participant’s assessment of the value to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy.2  “Appropriate monetary policy” is defined as the future path of policy that each participant deems most likely to foster outcomes for economic activity and inflation that best satisfy his or her individual interpretation of the statutory mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability."
" All participants who submitted longer -run projections expected that,  in 2018, real GDP would expand at a pace exceeding their individual estimates of the longer -run growth rate of real GDP."
 Participants generally saw real GDP growth moderating somewhat in each of the following two years but remaining above their estimates  of the longer -run rate.
" All participants who submitted longer -run projections expected that, throughout the projection period, the unemployment rate would run below their estimates of its longer -run level."
" All participants projected that inflation, as measured by the four -quarter percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), would run at or slightly above the Committee’s 2 percent objective by the end of 2018 and remain roughly flat through 2020."
" Compared with the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) from March, most participants slightly marked up their projections of real GDP growth in 2018 and somewhat lowered their projections for the unemployment rate from 2018 through 2020; participants indicated that these revi sions reflected, in large part, strength in incoming data."
 A large majority of participants made slight upward adjustments to their projections of inflation in                                                  1 Three members of the Board of Governors were in office at the time of the June 2018 meeting.
" As shown in figure 2, participants generally continued to expect that the evolution of the economy relative to their objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation would likely warrant further gradual increases in the federal funds rate."
" As in March, most participants judged the risks around their projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation to be broadly ba lanced."
" The Outlook for Economic Activity  The median of participants’ projections for the growth rate of real GDP, conditional on their individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy, was 2.8  percent for this year and 2.4  percent for next year."
" The median was 2.0 percent for 2020, a touch above the median projection of longer -run growth."
 Most participants continued to cite fiscal policy as a driver of strong economic activity over the next couple of years.
" Many participants also mentioned acco mmodative monetary policy and financial conditions, strength in the global outlook, continued momentum in the labor market, or positive readings on business and consumer sentiment a s important factors shaping the  economic  outlook ."
" Compared with the March SEP, the median of participants’ projections for the rate of real GDP growth was 0.1  percentage point higher for this year and unchanged for the next two years."
 Almost all participants expected the unemployment rate to decline somewhat further over the  projection period.
" The median of participants’ projections for the unemployment rate was 3.6  percent for the final quarter of this year and 3.5 percent for the final quarters of 2019 2 One participant did not submit longer -run projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, or the federal funds rate."

Projections forthe unemployment rate are for the average civilian unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of the year indicated.
Each participant’s projections arebased on his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy.
Longerrun projections represent each participant’s assessment of the rate to which eachvariable would be expected to converge under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy.
"One participant did not submit longerrun projections for the change in realGDP, the unemployment rate, or the federal funds rate in conjunction with the March 20–21, 2018, meeting, and one participant did not submit suchprojections in conjunction with the June 12–13, 2018, meeting.1.

  Figures 3.A and 3.B show the distributions of participants’ projections for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate from 2018 to 2020 and over the longer run.
 The distribution of individual projections f or real GDP growth this year shifted up noticeably from that in the March SEP.
" By contrast, the distributions of projected real GDP growth in 2019 and 2020 and over the longer run were little changed."
" The distributions of individual projections for the unemployment rate in 2018 to 2020 shifted down relative to the distributions in March , while the downward shift in the distribution of  longer -run projections was very modest ."
"The Outlook for Inflation  The medians of participants’ projections for total and core PCE price inflation in 2018 were 2.1  percent  and 2.0 percent, respectively, and the median for each measure was 2.1 percent in 2019 and 2020."
" Compared with the March SEP, the medians of participants’ projections for total PCE price inflation for this year and next were revised up slightly."
 The median of participants’ forecasts for core PCE price inflation was  up a touch for this year and unchanged for subsequent years.
 Figures 3.C and 3.D provide information on the distributions of participants’ views about the outlook for inflation.
 The distributions of both total and core PCE price inflation for 2018 sh ifted to the right relative to the distributions in March.
" The distributions of projected inflation in 2019, 2020, and over the longer run were roughly unchanged."
 Appropriate Monetary Policy Figure 3.E provides the distribution of participants’ judgments regarding the appropriate target —or midpoint of the target range —for the federal funds rate at the end of each year from 2018 to 2020 and over the longer run.
" The distributions of projected policy rates through 2020 shifted modestly higher, consistent with the revisions to participants’ projections of real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation."
" As a reference, table 2 provides measures of forecast uncertainty, based on the forecast errors of various private and government foreca sts over the past 20 years, for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and total PCE price inflation."

" As described in the box “Forecast Uncertainty,” under cert ain assumptions, there is about a 70 percent probability that actual outcomes for real GDP, unemployment, consumer prices, and the federal funds rate will be in ranges implied by the average size of projection errors made in the past."
"  Participants’ assessments of the level of uncertainty surrounding their individual economic projections are shown in the bottom -left panels of figures  4.A, 4.B, and 4.C.  Nearly all participants viewed the degree of uncertainty attached to their econo mic projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as broadly similar to the average of the past 20  years, a view that was essentially unchanged from March.3 Because the fan charts are constructed to be symmetric around the median projections, they do not reflect any asymmetries in the balance of risks that participants may see in their economic projections."
" Participants’ assessments of the balance of risks to their economic projections are shown in the bottom -right panels of figures 4.A, 4.B, and 4.C.  Most participants judged the risks to their projections of real GDP growth, the   unemployment rate, total inflation, and core inflation as                                                   3 At the end of this summary, the box “Forecast Uncertainty” discusses the sources and interpretation of uncertainty surrounding t he economic forecasts and explains the approach broadly balanced —in other words, as broadly consistent with a symmetric fan chart."
" Specifically, for GDP growth, only one participant viewed the risks as tilted to the downside, and the number of participants who viewed the risks as tilted to the  upside dropped from four to two."
" For the unemployment rate, the number of participants who saw the risks as tilted toward low readings dropped from four to two."
" For inflation, all but one participant judged the risks to either total or core PCE price inflation as broadly balanced."
"  In discussing the uncertainty and risks surrounding their projections, several participants continued to point to fiscal developments as a source of upside risk, many participants cited developments related to trade policy as posing downside risks to their growth forecasts, and a few participants also pointed to political developments in Europe or the global outlook more generally as  downside-risk factors."
 A few participants noted that the appreciation of the dollar posed downside risks to the inflation outlook.
 A few participants also noted the risk of inflation moving higher than anticipated as the unemployment rate falls.
" Because the Committee adjusts the federal funds rate in response to actual and prospective developments over time in real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation, uncertainty surrounding the projected path f or the federal funds rate importantly reflects the uncertainties about the paths for those key economic variables."

"The conﬁdence interval is not strictly consistent with theprojections for the federal funds rate, primarily because these projections are not forecasts of the likeliest outcomes forthe federal funds rate, but rather projections of participants’ individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy.Still, historical forecast errors provide a broad sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rategenerated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policythat may be appropriate to oﬀset the eﬀects of shocks to the economy.The conﬁdence interval is assumed to be symmetric except when it is truncated at zero—the bottom of the lowesttarget range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted in the past by the Committee."
This truncation wouldnot be intended to indicate the likelihood of the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary policyaccommodation if doing so was judged appropriate.
"Because currentconditions may diﬀer from those that prevailed, on average, over the previous 20 years, the width and shape of theconﬁdence interval estimated on the basis of the historical forecast errors may not reﬂect FOMC participants’ currentassessments of the uncertainty and risks around their projections.* The conﬁdence interval is derived from forecasts of the average level of shortterm interest rates in the fourthquarter of the year indicated; more information about these data is available in table 2."
"The shaded area encompassesless than a 70 percent conﬁdence interval if the conﬁdence interval has been truncated at zero.Summary of Economic Projections of the Meeting of June 12–13, 2018Page 15_____________________________________________________________________________________________      Forecast Uncer tainty  The economic projections provided by the members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks inform discussions of monetary policy among policymakers and can aid public understanding of the basis for policy actions."
" Thus, in setting the stance of monetary policy, participants consider not only what appears to be the most likely economic outcome as embodied in their projections, but also the range of alternative possibilities, the likelihood of their occurring, and the potential costs to the economy should they occur."
" Table 2 summarizes the average historical accuracy of a range of forecasts, including those reported in past Monetary Policy Report s and those prepared by the Federal Reserve Board’s staff in advance of meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)."
 The corresponding 70  percent confidence intervals for overall inflation would be 1.3 to 2.7  percent in the current year and 1.0 to 3.0  percent in the second and third years .
" Figures 4.A th rough 4.C illustrate these confidence bounds in “fan charts” that are symmetric and centered on the medians of FOMC participants’ projections for GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation."
" In particular, the unemployment rate cannot be negative; furthermore, the risks around a particular projection might be tilted to either the upside or the downside, in which case the corresponding fan chart would be asymmetrically positioned around the median projection."
" These judgments are summarized in the lower -right panels of figures 4.A through 4.C.  As with real activity and inflation, the outlook for the future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable uncertainty."
 This uncertainty arises primarily because each participant ’s assessment of the appropriate stance of monetary policy depends importantly on the evolution of real activity and inflation over time.
 The final line in table  2 shows the error ranges for forecasts of short -term interest rates.
" It should be noted, however, that these confidence intervals are not strictly consistent with the projections for the federal funds rate, as t hese projections are not forecasts of the most likely quarterly outcomes but rather are projections of participants’ individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy and are on an end -ofyear basis."
" However, the forecast errors should provide a sense  of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy that would be appropriate to offset the effects of shocks to the econom y."
 This approach to the construction of the federal funds rate fan chart would be merely a convention; it would not have any implications for possible future policy decisions regarding the use of  negative interest rates to provide additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so were appropriate.
