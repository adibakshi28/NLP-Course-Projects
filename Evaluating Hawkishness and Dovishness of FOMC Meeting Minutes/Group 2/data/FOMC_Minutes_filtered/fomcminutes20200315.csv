" The nominal U.S. international trade deficit narrowed in January, as a steep fall in imports more than offset a decline in exports."
  The pace of eco nomic growth abroad was already subdued before the outbreak.
" In the advanced foreign economies (AFEs), real GDP growth had slowed sharply at the end of 2019, and indicators pointed to only a modest pickup in economic growth early this year."
" In the emergi ng market economies (EMEs), incoming data had been more positive, as indicators for hightech and manufacturing production in Asian economies outside of China were upbeat, and the effects of social protests in Chile and Hong Kong, along with the effects of  the General Motors  strike on Mexican economic activity, had faded."
" By early February, however, the coronavirus outbreak in China brought economic activity in many parts of the country to a standstill."
" Late in the inter meeting period, short -term funding markets showed signs of stress, with elevated demand for repo funding  and increased shortterm spreads ."
" Data from before the escalation of coronavirus concerns in late February suggested that financial conditions for nonfinancial businesses and for households had generally remained supportive of economic activity and spending, but developments late in the intermeeting period pointed to tightening credit conditions."

" Participants ’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook  Participants noted that the coronavirus outbreak was harming communities and disrupting economic activity in many countries, including the United States, and that global financial conditions had also been significantly affected."
" They commented that the measures —such as social distancing —taken in response to the pandemic, while needed to contain the outbreak, would nevertheless take a toll on U.S. economic activity in the near term."
 Information received since the Committee met in January indicated that the labor market remained strong through February and that economic activity rose at a moderate rate.
" Job gains had been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate had  remained low."
" On a 12 -month basis, overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy had been running below 2 percent."
  Survey -based measures of longer -term inflation expectations had been little changed.
 All saw U.S. economic activity as likely to decline in the coming quarter and viewed downside risks to the economic outlook as having increased significantly .
" Participants noted that the timing of the resumption of growth in the U.S. economy depended on the containment measures put in place, as well as the success of those measures, and on the responses of other policies, including fiscal policy."
" With regard to households’ behavior, participants noted that, although consumption spending had been a key driver of growth in economic activity through the first  two months  of this year, the pandemic was starting to impair consumer confidence and to exert  an adverse effect on household  balance sheets."
 Participants expressed concern that households with low incomes had less of a savings buffer with which to meet expenses during the interruption to economic activity.
 This situation made those households more vulnerable to a downturn in the economy and tended to magnify the reduction in aggregate demand associated with the nation’s response to the pandemic.
" These sectors included those affected by the cancellation of many events, decisions by firms and households to reduce travel, government -mandated reductions in entry from abroad, and cutbacks on economic activity that required in -person interaction."
 Participants observed that the coronavirus outbreak had inevitably hurt business confidence and that the expected length and severity of the restrictions on economic activity that involved inperson interaction would importantly affect the size of the response of investment spending to the situation.
" Participants noted that foreign economic growth for the first half of this year would be badly hit by the severe disruptions to economic activity abroad associated with the response to the coronavirus outbreak, including the recent measures taken in major European countries."
" With regard to the labor market, participants noted that some firms would likely need to cut employment immediately."
"  Other firms, however, were lookin g for ways to retain employees during the period of reduced economic activity, in order to maintain capacity and be able to ramp up production once the public health crisis abated and demand rebounded."
 Participants observed that businesses wou ld be more likely to lay off workers on a major scale if the downturn in economic activity came to be perceived as likely to be protracted.
" Participants commented that workers most severely affected in the current situation were those who were ill, those with low incomes, those connected to the most hard -hit sectors, and those with irregular or contingent employment."
" With regard to inflation, participants noted that it had been running below the Committee’s 2 percent longer -run objective before the coronavirus outbreak."
" They remarked that a stronger dollar, weaker demand,  and lower oil prices were factors likely to put downward pressure on inflation in the period ahead and observed that this meant that the return of  inflation to the Committee’s 2 percent longer -run objective would likely be further delayed."
" Participants indicated, however, that  implementing  a more accommodative stance of monetary policy at this meeting could be useful in helping offset these factors over time and in achieving the 2 percent inflation Minutes of the Meeting of March 15, 2020Page 7_____________________________________________________________________________________________  objective over the longer run, by helping prevent circumst ances of persistent resource slack or a lasting decline in inflation expectations."
  Participants all agreed that the effects of the pandemic would weigh on economic activity in the near term and that the duration of this period of weakness was uncertain.
 Participants raised several alternative scenarios with regard to the likely behavior of economic activity in the second half of this year.
 These scenarios differed from one another in the assumed length and severity of disruptions to economic activity.
" Several participants emphasized that the temporary nature of the shock  to economic activity, the fact that the shock arose in the nonfinancial sector, and the healthy state of the U.S. banking system all implied that the current situation was not directly comparable with the previous decade’s financial crisis and it need not be followed by negative effects on economic activity as longlasting as those associated with that crisis."
" Participants agreed that the Federal Reserve ’s efforts to relieve stress in financial markets would help limit downside near -term outcomes by supporting credit flows to households and businesses, and that a more accommodative monetary policy stance would provide support to economic activity beyond the near term."
" Such an event could lead to more wideranging temporary shutdowns , with adverse implications for the production of goods and services and for aggregate demand."
" Participants expressed concern about the disruptions to the functioning of these markets, especially in view of their status as cornerstones for the operation of the U.S. and global financial systems and for the transmission of monetary policy."
" In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, most participants  judged that it would be appropriate to lower the target range for the federal funds  rate by 100 basis points , to 0 to ¼ percent."
" In discussing the reasons for such a decision, these participants pointed to a likely decline in economic activity in the near term related to the effects of the coronavirus outbreak and the extremely large degree of uncertainty regarding how long and severe such a decline in activity would be."
" In light of the sharply increased downside risks to the economic outlook posed by the global coronavirus outbreak, these participants noted that risk -management considerations pointed toward a forceful monetary policy response, with the majority favoring a 100 basis point cut that would bring  the target range to its effective lower bound  (ELB)."
" With regard to monetary policy beyond this meeting, these participants judged that it would be appropriate to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent until policymakers were confident that the economy had weathered r ecent events and was on track to achieve the Committee’s  maximum employment and price stability goals."
 A few participants preferred a 50 basis point cut at this meeting and noted that such a decision would provide support to economic activity in the face of the anticipated effects of the coronavirus.
 These participants preferred to wait until there was greater  assurance that the transmission mechanism of monetary policy via financial markets and the supply of credit to households and businesses was working  effectively.
 Some participants noted that it was important to stress in communications that the primary purpose of these asset purchases was to support the smooth functioning of Treasury and agency MBS markets rather than to provide further monetary policy accommodatio n by pushing down longer -term yields .
" A few participants also remarked that lowering the target range to the ELB could increase the likelihood that some market interest rates would turn negative, or foster investor expectations of negative policy rates."
 Such expectations would run counter to participants’ previously expressed views that they would prefer to use other monetary policy tools to provide further accommodation at the ELB .
" Additionally, several participants remarked that the public might view the ability of the Committee to provide further monetary policy accommodation as being limited."
" However, so me participants noted that the Committee would still be able to provide monetary policy accommodation even after lowering the target range for the federal funds rate to the ELB ."
" Committee Policy Action  In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, members noted that the coronavirus outbreak had harm ed communities and disrupted economic activity in many countries, including the United States, and that global financial conditions had also been significantly affected."
" Available economic data showed that the U.S. economy came into this challenging perio d on a strong footing, with a strong labor market, a low unemployment rate, and moderate growth in household spending, although business fixed investment and exports had remained weak."
" On a 12 -month basis, overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy were running below 2 percent."
" Marketbased measures of inflation compensation had declined, and surveybased measures of longer -term inflation expectations were little changed."
 Members judged that the effects of the coronavirus would weigh on economic activity in the near term and would pose risks to the economic outlook.
 These members expected that the target range would be maintained at this level  until they were confident that the economy had weathered recent events and was on track to achieve the Committee’s  maximum employment and price stability goals.
" One member preferred to lower the target range by 50 basis points, to ½ to ¾ percent, at this meeting, in support of the actions taken to promote smooth market functioning and the flow of credit to households and businesses and in light of the anticipated effects of the coronavirus on economic activity and the economic outlook."
"In this participant’s  view, a 50 basis point cut would preserve space for further cuts in the target range that could be implemented when market conditions  had improved enough to ensure that the monetary policy transmission mechanism was functi oning ."
"Members noted that they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook, including information related to public health as well as global developments and muted inflation pressures, and that the Committee would use its tools and act as appropriate to support the economy."
" Members observed that, in determining the timing and size of future adjustments  to the stance of monetary policy, the Committee would assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum -employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective."
" They also agreed that those assessments would take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
 Members emphasized that the Federal Reserve was prepared to use its full range of tools to support the flow of credit to households and businesses and thereby promote its maximum -employment and pricestability goals.
"” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for  release  at 5:00 p.m.:   “The coronavirus outbreak has harmed communities and disrupted economic activity in many countries, including the United States."
 Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in January indicates that the labor market remained strong through February and economic activity rose at a moderate rate.
" Job gains have been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low."
" On a 12 -month basis, overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and ener gy are running below 2 percent."
 Marketbased measures of inflation compensation have declined; survey -based measures of longer -term inflation expectations are little changed.
" Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
 The effects of the coronavirus will w eigh on economic activity in the near term and pose risks to the economic outlook.
 The Committee expects to maintain this target range until it is confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals.
" This action will help support economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation returning  to the Committee’ s symmetric 2  percent objective."
" The Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook, including information related to public health, as well as global developments and muted inflation pressures, and will use its tools and act as appropriate to support the economy."
" In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the stance of monetary policy, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its  maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective."
" This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations,  and readings on financial and international developments."
" Minutes of the Meeting of March 15, 2020Page 11_____________________________________________________________________________________________  The Federal Reserve is prepared to use its full range of tools to support the flow of credit to households and businesses and thereby promote its maximum employment and price stability goals."
" Consistent with the Committee’s decision to lower the target range for the federal funds rate to 0  to ¼ percent, the Board of Governors voted unanimously to lower the interest rate paid on required and ex cess reserve balances to 0.10  percent and voted unanimously to approve a 1½ percentage point decrease in the primary credit rate to 0.25 percent, effective March 16, 2020."
 Financial market participants’ views on the likely course of U.S. monetary policy had changed since the Committee’s January meeting.
 Market commentary had interpreted Chair Powell’s February 28 statement as indicating the FOMC was prepared to lower the target range for the federal funds r ate at or before the March meeting to support the achievement of the Committee’s maximum employment and price stability goals.
" Available indicators for China su ggested that the spread of the coronavirus had been associated with a collapse in economic activity during the first quarter, with spillovers to the global economy from the drop in Chinese demand and disruption of supply chains."
" All told, foreign economic activity was expected to be significantly weaker during the first half of 2020 than the staff had anticipated at the time of the January FOMC meeting."
 The outlook for real economic activity over the remainder of the year was highly uncertain and depended on the spread of the virus and the measures taken to contain it.
" Scenarios involving a greater spread of the coronavirus and more severe social -distancing actions would be associated with a greater shutdown of production and disruption of supply chains, larger negative effects on consumer and business sentiment, more significant increases in unemployment, and worsening financial conditions."
" Reductions in demand, coupled with a stronger U.S. dollar and weaker commodity prices, were expected to put downward pressure on inflation, with the magnitude of the softening in core inflation depending on the severity of the situation."
 A forceful monetary policy action could provide a clear signal to the public that policymakers recognized the potential economic significance of the situation and were willing to move decisively to support the achievement of the Committee’s dual mandate goals and counter the recent tightening of financial conditions.
" Although a reduction in the policy rate would not slow the spread of infecti on or remedy broken supply chains, it could help shore up the confidence of households, businesses, and financial markets; ease financial strains of consumers and firms ; and provide meaningful support to the economy in the face of a large shock to demand."
" However, the coronavirus poses evolv -ing risks to economic activity."
" In light of these risks and in support of achieving its maximum employment and price stability goals, the Federal Open Market Committee decided today to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by ½ percentage point, to 1 to 1 ¼ percent."
" Consistent with the Committee’s decision to lower the target range for the federal funds rate to 1 to 1¼ percent, the Board of Governors completed on March 3, 2020, unanimous votes to lower the interest rate paid on  required and excess reserve balances to 1.10 percent and to approve a ½  percentage point decrease in the primary credit rate to 1.75 percent, effective March  4, 2020."
