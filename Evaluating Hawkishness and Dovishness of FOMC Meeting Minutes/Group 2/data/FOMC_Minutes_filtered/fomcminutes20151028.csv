"Natalucci, Associate Director, Division of Monetary Affairs, Board of Governors  ________________ ¹ Attended Tuesday morning’s discussion of equilibrium real interest rates and Wednesday’s session."
 2 Attended Tuesday’s session following the discussion of equilibrium real interest rates.
 5 Attended through the discussion o f equilibrium real interest rates.
"   Equilibrium Real Interest Rates  The staff presented several briefings regarding the concept of an equilibrium real interest rate —sometimes labeled  the “neutral” or “natural” real interest rate , or “r*”—that can serve as a benchmark to help gauge the stance of monetary policy."
" According to one definition, short -run r* is the level of the real short -term interest rate that, if obtained currently, would result in the economy operating at full employment or, in some simple models of the economy , at full employment and price stability ."
 The staff summarized the behavior of estimates of the shortrun equilibrium real rate over recent business cycles as well as long errun trends in real interest rates and key factors that influence those trends.
"With respect to longer -ru n trends, the staff noted that multiyear averages of short -term real interest rates had  been declining not only in the United States , but also in many other large economies for the past quarter -century and stood  near zero in most of those economies."
" Moreover, economic theory indicates that the equilibrium level of short -term real interest rates would likely remain low relative to estim ates of its level before the financial crisis if trend growth of total factor productivity does not pick up and if demographic projections for slow growth in working -age populations are borne out."
" Finally, the staff discussed the implications of uncertain ty Page 2Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ about the level of the equilibrium real rate for using estimates of short -run r* as a guideline for appropriate monetary policy."
" In their comments on the briefings and in their discussion of the potential use of r* in monetary policy deliberations, policymakers made a number of observations."
" The unemployment rate has declined gradually in recent years, indicating that real gross domestic product ( GDP ) growth has, on average, exceeded growth of potential GDP, but not by a substantial margin."
" This outcome, in turn, suggested that the actual level of short -term real interest rates has been below but not substantially below the equilibrium real rate , consistent with estimates that r* currently is close to zero, notably below its historical average."
" Moreover, it was noted that the long errun downward trend in real interest rates suggested that short -run r* would likely remain below levels that were normal during previous business cycle expansions, and that the longer -run normal level to which the nominal federal funds rate might be expected to converge in the absence of further shocks to the economy—that is, the level th at would be consistent, in the long run, with maximum employment and 2 percent inflation —would likely be lower than was the case in previous decades."
 A smaller gap might increase the frequency of episodes in which policymakers would not be able to reduce the federal funds rate enough to promote a strong economic recovery and rapid return to maximum employment or to maintain price stability in the aftermath of negative shocks to aggregate demand.
" Takeup of the System’s overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations increased during this period, evidently reflecting a modest narrowing of the spread of money market interest rates over the offered rate on such operations."
" Inflation continued to run below the FOMC’s longer -run objective of 2  percent, restrained in part by declines in energy prices and prices of non -energy imported goo ds."
 Survey measures of longer -run inflation expectations remained stable; market -based measures of inflation compensation moved slightly lower.
" Total nonfarm payroll employment expanded at about the same rate in September as in August, although  at a slowe r pace than earlier this year, and the unemployment rate remained at 5.1  percent."
 Both  the labor force participation rate and  the employmentto-population ratio edged down.
 The U.S. international trade deficit widened in August as exports declined and imports rose.
" The fall in exports was concentrated in industrial supplies , while consumer and capital goods accounted for much of the growth in imports."
" Advance estimates for September indicated a narrower merchandise trade deficit, with a rebound in exports and a decline in imports relative to August."
" Core PCE inflation, which excludes changes in food and energy prices, was 1¼ percent over the same 12month period, restrained in part by declines in the prices of nonenergy goods i mports."
" Measures of expected longer -run inflation from a number of surveys, including the  Michigan survey, the Blue Chip Economic Indicators, and the Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers, remained stable."
" However, market -based measures of inflation compensation moved a little lower."
" Average hourly earnings for all employees increased 2¼  percent over the 12 months ending in September, a pace that was faster than consumer price inflation."
 Foreign economic growth appeared to have improved somewhat in the third quarter following two quarters of slow growth.
" Economic activity rebounded in Canada after disruptions to energy production earlier in the year, and real GDP growth jumped to 5 percent in South Korea as the effects of the MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) outbreak faded."
" Chinese real GDP growth remained around 7 percent on a four -quarte r change basis, and information on economic activity in the euro area and the United Kingdom was  consistent with continued expansion."
" However, indicators of economic activity in Japan and Brazil remained weak."
 Headline inflation was low in many countries as a result of falling Page 4Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ energy prices.
 Inflation rates remained high in some South American cou ntries whose currencies had recently depreciated sharply.
" Staff  Review of the Financial  Situation  Continued concerns about the global economic growth outlook weighed on market sentiment in the United States and abroad early in the intermeeting period, but sentiment improved somewhat in the weeks preceding the October FOMC meeting."
" Following the weaker -thanexpected report on the U.S. employment situation in September, market participants’ expectations for the timing of the initial increase in the target range for the federal funds rate shifted out , and their expectation for the subsequent path of the federal funds rate flattened."
 Federal Reserve communications and economic data releases over the intermeeting period appeared to have led investors to expect a later start date for monetary policy normalization  and a more gradual path  for the federal funds rate  thereafter .
" Nominal Treasury yields declined further, reflecting FOMC communications, concerns about global economic growth, and generally weaker -thanexpected U .S."
 Measures of inflation compensation based on Treasury InflationProtected Securities moved slightly lower on net.
" All major categories of CRE loans on banks’ balance sheets expanded robustly through September, consistent with reports of stronger demand for such loans in the SLOOS."
 Interest rates on 30 -year fixed -rate mortgages declined over the intermeeting period.
 The growth  of auto and student loans stayed robust.
" Minutes of the Meeting of October 27–28, 2015Page 5_____________________________________________________________________________________________ Continued concerns about the outlook for global economic growth weighed on commodity and foreign equity prices early in the intermeeting period."
" These declines subsequently were reverse d, and foreign equity price indexes ended the period higher, pushed up by expectations of additional monetary policy accommodation in major foreign economies and some favorable economic indicators in China."
 The dollar depreciated early in the period following the weaker -thanexpected U.S. employment report for September and the subsequent  downward  shift of the expected path  for U.S. policy rates.
" But t his decline was balanced by subsequent appreciation, in part as expectations increased for greater monetary policy accommodation abroad."
" Since the previous report in July, financial markets around the globe experienced a surge in volatility that peaked in late August amid concerns regarding slowing economic growth in emerging market economies and potential implications for advanced economies."
" Staff  Economic  Outlook  In the economic forecast prepared by the staff for the October FOMC meeting, real GDP growth in the second half of this year was a little lower, on balance, than in the projection for the September meeting, largely reflecting a downward revision to estimat ed inventory investment."
 The staff’s medium -term projection for real GDP growth was essentially unrevised from the previous forecast.
 The unemployment rate was expected to decline gradually and to run a little below the staff’s estimate of its longer -run natural rate over this period.
"The staff’s forecast for inflation in the near term was revised up a little, reflecting recent data, and it was unrevised over the medium term."
 The staff projected that inflation would inc rease gradually over the next several years but would still be slightly below the Committee’s longer -run objective of 2 percent at the end of 2018.
" However, inflation was anticipated to reach 2 percent thereafter, with inflation expectations in the longer  run assumed to be consistent with the Committee’s objective and slack in labor and product markets projected to have waned."
" The staff viewed the uncertainty around its October projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as simila r to the average of the past 20 years."
" The risks to the forecast for real GDP and inflation were seen as tilted to the downside, reflecting the staff’s assessment that neither monetary nor fiscal policy was well positioned to help the economy withstand su bstantial adverse shocks."
" Consistent with this downside risk to aggregate demand, the staff viewed the risks to its outlook for the unemployment rate as tilted to the upside."
" Participants ’ Views  on Current  Conditions  and the Economic  Outlook  In their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants saw the information received over the intermeeting period as suggesting that economic activity had been expanding moderately."
" Participants noted that the pace of job gains slowed while the unemployment rate held steady; nonetheless, a range of labor market indicato rs, on balance, suggested that underutilization of labor resources had diminished since early this year."
" With private domestic final demand expanding at a solid pace, participants generally viewed the incoming data as confirming their assessment that econ omic activity would continue to expand at a moderate rate, leading to further improvePage 6Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ ment in labor market conditions."
" However, some participants were concerned that the recent slowdown in employment growth might prove more than temporary, and that improve ment in  labor market conditions  might not continue."
 Most participants saw the downside risks arising from economic and financial developments abroad as having diminished and judged the risks to the outlook for domestic economic activity and the labor mark et to be nearly balanced.
" Inflation continued to run below the Committee’s 2 percent longer -run objective, partly reflecting declines in energy prices and prices of  nonenergy imports."
 Market -based measures of inflation compensation moved slightly lower ; survey -based measures of longer -term inflation expectations remained stable.
 Participants generally anticipated that inflation would rise gradually toward 2 percen t as the labor market improved further and the transitory effects of earlier declines in energy and import prices dissipated.
" Notwithstanding the disappointing retail sales data in September, participants were encouraged by the solid pace of consumption growth in the third quarter and generally expected consumer spending to rise moderately going forward."
" Gains in employment and income, low gasoline prices, and a high level of  consumer confidence were viewed as factors that should support consumer spending."
"  A large decline in inventory investment was expected to reduce the pace of GDP growth in the third quarter , but participants saw further outsized declines  in inventory accumulation as  unlikely ."
" Participants expected net exports to continue to subtract from GDP growth in the second half of the year, reflecting weak foreign activity as well as the earlier appreciation of the dollar."
" However, solid underlying momentum in private domestic demand was anticipated to support economic growth going forward."
" Although employment growth slowed and the unemployment rate held steady in Septemb er, participants agreed that underutilization of labor resources had been reduced since earlier in the year."
" A number of participants expressed the view that further progress would be necessary before labor market conditions were fully consistent with max imum employment, while some others judged that there was little or no remaining underutilization of labor resources."
 Several participants observed that the recent employment reports had increased the uncertainty about the outlook for the labor market.
" A number of participants cited staff analysis  indicating  that the modest pace of labor compensation growth in recent years may have reflected slower trend productivity growth that offset the upward pressure on wages from the narrowing of labor market Minutes of the Meeting of October 27–28, 2015Page 7_____________________________________________________________________________________________ slack."
" However, other participants noted that the continued subdued trend in wages was evidence of an absence of upward pressure on inflation from the current level of resource utilization."
 Participants discussed how recent economic developments influenced their expectations for reaching the FOMC’s 2 percent inflation objective over the medium term.
" Total PCE price inflation , as measured on a  12month basis,  continued to run below the Committee’s longer -run objective."
" Core PCE inflation also remained low, but s ome other measures of inflation, such as the trimmed mean PCE and trimmed mean CPI measures, continued to run at higher levels than core PCE inflation and had recently moved up modestly ."
" Moreover, a few participants noted that the September CPI data appeared consistent with some firming in inflation."
 Surveys continued to suggest that longer -run inflation expectations remained stable.
 Participants still expected that the downward pressure on inflation from the previous declines in energy prices and the ef fects of past dollar appreciation would prove temporary.
" Several participants, however, cited downside risks to inflation, pointing , for example,  to declines in market -based measures of inflation compensation."
" Nonetheless, participants generally continued to anticipate that, with appropriate monetary policy, inflation would move toward the Committee’s objective over the medium term, reflecting the anticipated tightening of product and labor markets , the waning of downward pressures from energy and import prices,  and stable inflation expectations."
" Participant s commented on issues related to financial stability monitoring and the use of macroprudential tools, the assessment of valuation risks in leveraged loan and real estate markets, the widening of credit spreads on corporate bonds, and potential risks to financial stability stemming from interest rates remaining low for a prolonged period in an environment of a low neutral (or equilibrium) real rate."
"   During their discussion of economic conditions and monetary policy, participants focused on a number of issues associated with the timing and pace of policy normalization."
" Most participants anticipated that, based on their assessment of the current economic situation and their outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, these  conditions could well  be met by the time of the next meeting ."
 Another concern  mentioned  was the increasing risk of a buildup of financial imbalances after a prolonged period of very low interest rates.
"Several participants indicated that, despite lessening concerns about the implications of recent global economic and financial developments for domestic economic activity and inflation, appreciable downside risks to the outlook remained."
 T hey were con cerned about a potential loss of  momentum in the economy  and the associated possibility  that inflation might fail to increase as expected.
" They also noted  uncertainty about whether economic growth  was robust enough to withstand potential adverse shocks, given the limited ability of monetary policy to offset such shocks when the federal funds rate is near Page 8Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ its effective lower bound, and concern that the beginning of policy normalization might be associated with an unwarranted tightening of financial conditions."
 T hey judged it appropriate to wait for additional information providing evidence of further improvement in the labor market and increasing their confidence that inflation was on a path to return to 2  percent over the medium term before raising the target range for the federal funds rate.
" In addition, a couple of participants cited  concerns that a premature tightening might damage the credibility of the Committee’s inflation objective if inflation stayed below 2 percent for a prolonged period."
"  Several participants indicated that , in the current low interest rate environment, it would be prudent for the Committee to consider options for providing additional monetary policy accommodation if the outlook for economic activity were to weaken to a degree that seemed likely to undermine continued progress in labor market conditions and impede the movement of inflation back to the Committee’s 2 percent objective over the medium term."
 It was als o noted that  the Committee would  need to reformulate its communications regarding the near -term outlook for monetary policy  if the economic outlook weaken ed significantly.
" Participants also  indicated that the expected path of policy, rather than the timing of the initial increase, would be the more important influence on financial conditions and thus on the outlook for the economy and inflation , and they noted the importance of underscoring  this view at the time of liftoff."
" It was also emphasized  that, while participants’  most recent economic projections  suggested that a gradual increase in the target range for the federal funds rate will likely be appropriate to support progress toward the Committee’s dual objectives, monetary policy adjustments ultimately would be dependent on economic and financial dev elopments ."
"Committee  Policy  Action In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that information received since the FOMC met in September indicated that economic activity had been expanding at a moderate pace."
" Members indicated that they expected that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity would continue to expand at a moderate pace."
"  Almost all m embers agreed tha t, even though the pace of job gains had slowed and the unemployment rate had held steady over the intermeeting period, labor market indicators, on balance, showed that underutilization of labor resources had diminished since early in the year."
" Members an ticipated that economic activity was likely to expand at a pace sufficient for labor market indicators to continue to move toward, or to remain at,  levels the Committee judged consistent with its dual mandate."
" Inflation continued to run below the Committe e’s longer -run objective, held down in part by the effects of declines in energy prices and in prices of non -energy imports."
 Survey -based measures of longer -term inflation expectations had remained stable; market -based measures of inflation compensation had moved slightly lower.
" While inflation was anticipated to remain near its recent low level in the near term, reflecting the transitory effects of declines in energy and import prices, members continued to expect inflation to rise gradually toward 2 percent over the medium term as the labor market improved further and such transitory effects dissipated."
" Nonetheless , they agreed to continue monitoring inflation developments closely."
"   Members continued to anticipate that inflation would gradually return to the Committee’s 2  percent objective over the medium t erm, but most of them were not yet sufficiently confident of that outlook to begin the normalization process."
" They generally agreed that their confidence would increase if, as anticipated, economic activity continued to expand at a pace sufficient to incr ease resource utilization."
" Other factors important to the inflation outlook were the expectation that the influence of lower energy and commodities prices and the stronger dollar would subside, and that longer -term inflation expectations would remain stable."
" In this regard, a couple of members expressed concern about the continued decline in market -based measures of inflation compensation."
" Moreover, the risk was noted that downward pressures on inflation from the appreciation of the dollar could persist."
" After assessing the outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation and weighing the uncertainties associated with the outlook, all but one member agreed to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged at this meeting."
" Membe rs generally agreed that, in light of some weaker -thanexpected readings on measures of labor market conditions and in the absence of greater confidence about the inflation outlook, it would be prudent to wait for additional information bearing on the medi umterm outlook before initiating the process of policy normalization."
" In its postmeeting statement, rather than framing its nearterm policy path in terms of how long to maintain the current target range, the Committee decided to indicate that, in determining whether it would be appropriate to raise the target range at its next meeting, it would assess both realized and expected progress  toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation."
" Members emphasized that this change was intended to convey the sense that, while no decision had been made, it may well become  appropriate to initiate the normalization process at the next meeting, provided that unanticipated shocks do not adversely affect the economic outlook and that incoming data support the expectation that labor market conditions will continue to improve and that inflation will return to the Committee’s 2 percent ob jective over the medium term."
" While members differed in their assessment of the likelihood that incoming information will warrant an increase in the target range for the federal funds rate when the Committee meets in December, they agreed that, in making the decision, the Committee will evaluate progress toward its objectives, taking into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
" It was noted that the expected path of the federal funds rate, rather than the exact timing of the initial increase, was most important in influencing financial conditions and thus in affecting the outlook for the economy and inflation."
" The Committee reiterated its expectation that, even after employment and inflation are near mandateconsistent levels, economic conditions may, for some ti me, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run."
" At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee  voted  to authorize  and direct  the Federal  Reserve  Bank  of New York,  until it was instructed  otherwise,  to execute  transactions  in the SOMA  in accordance  with the following  domestic  policy  directive:  “Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster maximum employment and price stability."
 The System Open Market Account manager and the secretary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the System’s balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the Committee’s objectives of maximum employment and price stability.
” The vote encompassed  approval  of the statement below  to be released  at 2:00 p.m.:  “Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in September suggests that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace.
 The pace of job gains slowed and the unemployment rate held steady.
" Inflation has continued to run below the Committee’s longer -run objective, partly reflecting declines in energy prices and in prices of non - energy imports."
 Market -based measures of inflation compensation moved slightly lower;  survey -based measures of longer -term inflation expectations have remained stable.
" Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
" The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, with l abor market indicators continuing to move toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate."
  The Committee continues to see the risks to the outlook for economic activity and the labor market as nearly balanced but is monitoring global economic and financial developments.
  Inflation is anticipated to remain near its recent low level in the near term but the Committee expects inflation to rise gradually toward 2  percent over the medium term as the labor market improves further and the transitory effects of declines in energy and import prices dissipate.
 The Committee continues to monitor inflation developments closely.
" To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee today reaffirmed its view that the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate remains appropriate."
" In determining whether it will be appropriate  to raise the target range at its next meeting, the Committee will assess progress —both realized and expected —toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2  percent inflation."
" This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, includin g measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
 The Committee anticipates that it will be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate when it has seen some further improvement in the labor market and is reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term.
" When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer -run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent."
" The Committee currently anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near mandateconsistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the  longer run."
"Minutes of the Meeting of October 27–28, 2015Page 11_____________________________________________________________________________________________ Mr. Lacker dissented because he continued to believe that maintaining exceptionally low real interest rates was not appropriate for an economy with persistently strong consumption growth and tightening labor markets."
 Data received since the September FOMC meeting suggested that the global economic and financial developments of late summer had little effect on the medium -term outlook for U.S. growth and inflation.
 He remained reasonably confident that inflation would return to the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent g oal once temporary disinflationary impulses had passed.
