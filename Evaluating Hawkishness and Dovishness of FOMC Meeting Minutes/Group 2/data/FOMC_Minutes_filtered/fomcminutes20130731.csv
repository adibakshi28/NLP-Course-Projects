"In support of the Committee’s longerrun planning for improvements in the implementation of monetary policy, the Desk report also included a briefing on the potential for establishing a fi xedrate, fullallotment overnight reverse repurchase agreement facility as an additional tool for managing mon ey market interest rates."
" The staff also identified several key issues that would require consideration in the design of such a facility, including the choice of the appropriate fa cility interest rate and possible additions to the range of eligible counterparties."
Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information reviewed for the July 30–31 meeting indicated that economic activity expanded at a modest pace in the first half of the year.
" Privatesector employment increased further in June, but the unemployment rate was still elevated."
" Consumer price inflation slowed markedly in the second  quarter, likely restrained i n  p a r t  b y  s o m e  t r a n s i t o r y  factors, but measures of longerterm inflation expect ations remained stable."
" The staff’s assessment of economic activity and inflation in the first half of  2013, based on information available before the meeting began, was broadly consistent with the new information from the BEA."
"Private nonfarm employment rose at a solid pace in June, as in recent months, while total government employment decreased further."
" The unemployment rate was 7.6 percent in June, little changed from its level in the prior few months."
" The labor force participation rate rose slightly, as did the employmentto-population ratio."
" The rate of longduration unemployment decreased somewhat, but the share of workers employed part time for economic reasons moved up; both of  these measures remained relatively high."
" Forwardlooking indicators of labor market activity in the near term were mixed: Although household expectations for the labor market situation generally improved and firms’ hiring plans moved up, initial claims for unemployment insurance were essentially flat over the intermeeting period, and measures of job openings and the rate of gross privatesector hiring were little changed."
" However, construction activity was still at a low level, with demand restrained in part by tight credit standards for mortgage loans."
Growth in real private investment in equipment and intellectual property products was greater in the second quarter than in the first quarter.2  Nominal new orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft continued to trend up in May and June and were running above the level of shipments.
The U.S. international trade deficit widened in May as exports fell slightly and impor ts rose.
" Nearterm inflation expectations from the Michigan survey were little ch anged in June and July, as were longerterm inflation expectations, which remained within the narrow range seen in recent years."
Foreign economic growth appeared to remain subdued in comparison with longerrun trends.
" Production and business confidence turned up in Japan, real GDP growth picked up to a moderate pace in the s econd quarter in the United Kingdom, and recent indicators suggested that the  euroarea recession might be nearing an end."
" In contrast, Chinese real GDP growth moderated in the first half of this year compared with 2012, and indicators for other emerging market economies (EMEs) also pointed to lessrobust growth."
 Foreign inflation generally remained well contained.
" Monetary policy stayed highly accommodative in the advanced foreign economies, but some EME central banks tightened policy in reaction to capital outflows and to concerns about inflationary pressures from currency depreciation."
" Broad equity price indexes ended the period higher, and longerterm interest rates rose significantly."
" Sizable increases in rates occurred following the June FOMC meeting, as investors reportedly saw Committee communications as suggesting a less accommodative stance of monetary policy than had been expected going forward; however, a portion of the increases was reversed as subsequent policy communicaMinutes of the Meeting of July 30–31, 2013Page 3_____________________________________________________________________________________________tions lowered these concerns."
" U.S. economic data, particularly the June employment report, also contributed to the rise in yields over the period."
 Marketbased measures of inflation compensation were about unchanged.
" The   optionadjusted spread for productioncoupon MBS widened somewhat, possibly reflecting a downward revision in investors’ expectations for Federal Reserve MBS purchases, an increase in uncertainty about    longerterm interest rates, and convexityrelated MBS selling."
" Reflecting the reduced incentive to refinance as longerterm interest rates rose, the pace of gross issuance of investmentand speculativegrade corporate bonds dropped in June and July, compared with the elevated pace earlier this year."
 Le veraged loan issuance also continued to be strong amid demand for floatingrate instruments by investors.
"Staff Economic Outlook  The data received since the forecast was prepared for the previous FOMC meeting suggested that real GDP growth was weaker, on net, in the first half of the year than had been anticipated.3  Nevertheless, the staff still expected that real GDP would accelerate in the second half of the year."
 Part of this projected increase in the rate of real GDP growth reflected the staff’s expectation that the drag on economic growth from fiscal policy would be smaller in the second half as the pace of reductions in federal govern ment purchases slowed and as the restraint on growth in consumer spending stemming from the higher taxes put in place at the beginning of the year diminished.
" For the year as a whole, the staff anticipated that the rate of growth of real GDP would only slightly exceed that of potential output."
" The staff’s projection for real GDP growth over the medium term was essentially unrevised, as higher equity prices were seen as offsetting the restrictive effects of the increase in longerterm interest rates."
" The staff continued to foreca st that the rate of real GDP growth would streng then in 2014 and 2015, supported by a further easing in the effects of fiscal policy restraint on economic grow th, increases in consumer and business confidence, additional improvements in                                                  3 The staff’s forecast for the July FOMC meeting was prepared before the BEA released its estimate for real GDP in the second quarter and the re visions for earlier periods."
" credit availability, and accommodative monetary policy."
" The expansion in economic activity was anticipated to lead to a slow reduction in the slack in labor and product markets over the projection period, and the unemployment rate was expected to decline gradually."
The staff’s forecast for inflation was little changed from the projection prepared for the previous FOMC meeting.
 The staff continued to judge that much of the recent softness in consumer price inflation would be transitory and that inflation would pick up somewhat in the second half of this year.
" With longerrun inflation expectations assumed to re main stable, changes in commodity and import prices expected to be modest, and significant resource slack persisting over the forecast period, inflation was forecast to be subdued through 2015."
" Among the downside risks for economic activity were the uncertain effects and future course of fiscal policy, the possibility of adverse developments in foreign economies, and con cerns about the ability of the U.S. economy to weather potential future adverse shocks."
 The most salient risk for the inflation outlook was that the recent softness in inflation would not abate as anticipated.
"Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In their discussion of the economic situation, meeting participants noted that incoming information on economic activity was mixed."
" Private domestic final demand continued to increase in the face of tighter federal fiscal policy this year, but several participants pointed to evidence suggesting that fiscal policy had restrained spending in the first half of the year more than they previously thought."
" Perhaps partly for that reason, a number of participants indicated that growth in economic activity during the first half of this year was somewhat below their earlier expectations."
" In addition, subpar economic activity abroad was a negative factor for export growth."
" Conditions in the labor market improved further as private payrolls rose at a solid pace in June, but the unemployment rate remained elevated."
 Inflation continued to run below the Committee’s longerrun objective.
Participants generally continued to anticipate that the growth of real GDP would pick up somewhat in the second half of 2013 and streng then further thereafter.
" Factors cited as likely to support a pickup in economic Minutes of the Meeting of July 30–31, 2013Page 5_____________________________________________________________________________________________activity included highly accommodative monetary policy, improving credit availability, receding effects of fiscal restraint, continued stre ngth in housing and auto sales, and improvements in household and business balance sheets."
" A number of participants indicated, however, that they were somewhat less confident about a nearterm pickup in economic growth than they had been in June; factors cited in this regard included recent increases in mortgage rates,  higher oil prices, slow growth in key U.S. export markets, and the possibility that fiscal restraint might not lessen."
" However, a few participants expressed concern that higher household wealth might not translate into greater consumer spending, cautioning that household income growth remained slow, that households might not treat the additions to wealth arising from recent equity price increases as lasting, or that households’ scope to extract housing equity for the purpose of increasing their expenditures was less than in the past."
"The housing sector continued to pick up, as indicated by increases in house prices, low inventories of homes for sale, and strong demand for construction."
" While recent mortgage rate increases might serve to restrain housing activity, several participants expressed confidence that the housing recovery would be resilient in the face of the higher rates, variously citing pentup housing demand, banks’ increasing willingness to make mortgage loans, strong consumer confidence, stilllow real interest rates, and expectations of continuing rises in house prices."
" Although a stepup in business investment was likely to be a necessary element of the projected pickup in economic growth, reports from businesses ranged from those contacts who expressed heightened optimism to those who suggested that little acceleration was likely in the second half of the year."
"Participants reported further signs that the tightening in federal fiscal policy restrained economic activity in the first half of the year:  Cuts in government purchases and grants reportedly had been a factor contributing to slower growth in sales and equipment orders in some parts of the country, and consumer spending seemed to have been held back by tax increases."
The June employment report showed continued solid gains in payrolls.
" Nonetheless, the unemployment rate remained elevated, and the continuing low readings on the participation rate and the employmentto-population ratio, together with a high incidence of workers being employed part time for economic reasons, were generally seen as indicating that overall labor market conditions remained weak."
" It was noted that employment growth had been stronger than would have been expected given the recent pace of output growth, reflecting weak gains in productivity."
" Some participants pointed out that once productivity growth picked up, faster economic growth would be required to support further increases in employment along the lines seen of late."
" However, one participant thought that sluggish productivity performance was likely to persist, implying that the recent pace of output growth would be sufficient to maintain employment gains near current rates."
"Recent readings on inflation were below the Committee’s longerrun objective of 2 percent, in part reflecting transitory factors, and participants expressed a range of views about how soon inflation would return to           2 percent."
" A few participants, who felt that the recent low inflation rates were unlikely to persist or that the low PCE inflation readings might be marked up in future data revisions, suggested that, as transitory factors receded and the pace of recovery improved, inflation could be expected to return to 2 percent reasonably quickly."
" A number of others, however, viewed the low inflation readings as largely reflecting persistently deficient aggregate demand, implying that inflation could remain below 2 percent for a protracted period and further supporting the case for highly accommodative monetary policy."
" In discussing the increases in U.S. longerterm interest rates that occurred in the wake of the June FOMC meeting and the Page 6Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________associated press conference, meeting participants pointed to heightened financial market uncertainty about the path of monetary policy and a shift of market expectations toward less policy accommodation."
" A few participants suggested that this shift occurred in part because Committee participants’ economic projections, released following the June meeting, generally showed a somewhat more favorable outlook than those of private forecasters, or because the June policy statement and press conference were seen as indicating relatively little concern about inflation readings, which had been low and declining."
" Subsequent Federal Reserve communications, which emphasized that decisions about the two policy tools were distinct and underscored that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy would remain appropriate for a considerable period after purchases are completed, were seen as having helped clarify the Committee’s policy strategy."
" A number of participants mentioned that, by the end of the intermeeting period, market expectations of the future course of monetary policy, both with regard to asset purchases and with regard to the path of the federal funds rate, appeared well aligned with their own expectations."
" Nonetheless, some participants felt that, as a result of recent financial market developments, overall financial market conditions had tightened significantly, importantly reflecting larger term premiums, and they expressed concern that the higher level of longerterm interest rates could be a significant factor holding back spending and economic growth."
" Several others, however, judged that the rise in rates was likely to exert relatively little restraint, or that the increase in equity prices and easing in bank lending standards would largely offset the effects of the rise in longerterm interest rates."
"In looking ahead, meeting participants commented on several considerations pertaining to the course of monetary policy."
" First, almost all participants confirmed that they were broadly comfortable with the characterization of the contingent outlook for asset purchases that was presented in the June postmeeting press conference and in the July monetary policy testimony."
" At that point, if the economy evolved along the lines anticipated, the recovery would have gained further momentum, unemployment would be in the vicinity of 7 percent, and inflation would be moving toward the Committee’s 2 percent objective."
" A few participants, while comfortable with the plan, stressed the need to avoid putting too much emphasis on the 7 percent value for the unemployment rate, which they  saw only as illustrative of conditions that could obtain at the time when the asset purchases are completed."
" A few participants expressed concern that a decision to lower the unemployment threshold could potentially lead the public to view the unemployment threshold as a policy variable that could not only be moved down but also up, thereby calling into question the credibility of the thresholds and undermining their effectivene ss."
" Nonetheless, several participants were willing to  contemplate lowering the unemployment threshold if additional accommodation were to become necessary or if the Committee wanted to adjust the mix of policy tools used to provide the appropriate level of accommodation."
" A number of participants also remarked on the possible usefulness of providing additional information on the Committee’s intentions regarding adjustments to the federal funds rate after the 6½ percent unemployment rate threshold was reached, in order to strengthen or clarify the Committee’s forward guidance."
" One participant suggested that the Committee could announce an additional, lower set of thresholds for inflation and unemployment; another indicated that the Committee could provide guidance stating that it would not raise its target for the federal funds rate if the inflation rate was expected to run below a given level at a specific horizon."
 The latter enhancement to the forward guidance might be seen as reinforcing the message that the Committee was willing to defend its longerterm inflation goal from below as well as from above.
Committee Policy Action Committee members viewed the information received over the intermeeting period as suggesting that economic activity expanded at a modest pace during the first half of the year.
" Labor market conditions showed further improvement in recent months, on balance, but the unemployment rate remained elevated."
" Household spending and business fixed investment advanced, and the housing sector was strengthening, but mortgage rates had risen somewhat and fiscal policy was restraining economic growth."
" The Committee expected that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic growth would pick up from its recent pace, resulting in a gradual decline in the unemployment rate toward levels consistent with the Committee’s dual mandate."
" With economic activity and employment continuing to grow despite tighter fiscal policy, and with global financial conditions less strained  overall, members generally continued to see the downside risks to the outlook for the economy and the labor market as having diminished since last fall."
" Inflation was running below the Committee’s longerrun objective, partly reflecting transitory influences, but longerrun inflation expectations were stable, and the Committee anticipated that inflation would move back toward its 2 percent objective over the medium term."
" Members recognized, however, that inflation persistently below the Committee’s 2 percent objective could pose risks to economic performance."
"In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy was warranted in order to foster a stronger economic recovery and sustained improvement in labor market conditions in a context of price stability."
" The unemployment rate had declined considerably since then, and recent gains in payroll employment had been solid."
" However, other measures of labor utilization—including the labor force pa rticipation rate and the numbers of discouraged workers and those working part time for economic reasons—suggested more modest improvement, and other indicators of labor demand, such as rates of hiring and quits, remained low."
" In addition, the Committee reaffirmed its intention to keep the target federal fund s rate at              Page 8Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________0 to ¼ percent and retained its forward guidance that it anticipates that this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be approp riate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6½ percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee’s 2 percent longerrun goal, and longerterm inflation expectations  continue to be well anchored."
" In addition to updating its description of the state of the economy, the Committee decided to underline its concern about recent shortfalls of inflation from its longerrun goal by including in the statement an indication that it recognizes that inflat ion persistently below its    2 percent objective could pose risks to economic performance, while also noting that it continues to anticipate that inflation will move  back toward its objective over the medium term."
 The Committee decided to indicate in the statement that it “reaffirmed its view”—rather than simply “expects”—that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens.
"  At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct  the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: “Consistent with its st atutory mandate, the Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster maximum employment and price stability."
 The System Open Market Account Manager and the  Secretary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the System’s balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the Committee’s objectives of maximum employment and price stability.” The vote encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p.m.: “Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in June suggests that economic activity expanded at a modest pace during the first half of the year.
" Labor market conditions have shown further improvement in recent months, on balance, but the unemployment rate remains elevated."
" Household spending and business fixed investment advanced, and the housing sector has been strengthening, but mortgage rates have risen somewhat and fiscal policy is restraining economic growth."
" Partly reflecting transitory influences, inflation has been running below the Committee’s longerrun objective, but longerterm inflation expectations have remained stable."
"Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
" The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic growth will pick up from its recent pace and the unemployment rate will gradually decline toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate."
" The Committee recognizes that inflation persistently below it s 2 percent objective could pose risks to economic performance, but it anticipates that inflation will move Minutes of the Meeting of July 30–31, 2013Page 9_____________________________________________________________________________________________back toward its objective over the medium term."
"To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate, the Committee decided to continue purchasing additional agency mortgagebacked securities at a pace of $40 billion per month and longerterm Treasury securities at a pace of $45 billion per month."
" Taken together, these actions should maintain downward pressure on longerterm interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative."
 The Committee is prepared to increase or reduce the pace of its purchases to maintain appropriate policy accommodation as the outlook for the labor market or inflation changes.
"To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee today reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropr iate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens."
" In particular, the Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at  0 to ¼ percent and currently anticipates that this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above  6½ percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee’s 2 percent longerrun goal, and longerterm inflation expectations continue to be well anchored."
" In determining how long to maintain a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy, the Committee will also consider other information, including additional measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings  on financial developments."
" When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced appr oach consistent with its longerrun goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent.” Voting for this action:   Ben Bernanke, William C."
