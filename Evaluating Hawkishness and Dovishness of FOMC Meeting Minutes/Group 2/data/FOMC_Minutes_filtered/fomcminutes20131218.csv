 The staff reported that they saw potential benefits to extending the exercise and in January would likely recommend a continuation along with possible adjustments to program parameters that could provide additional insights into the demand for a potential facility and it s efficacy in putting a floor on money market rates.
 The proposed increase in caps was intended  to test the Desk’s ability to manage somewhat larger operational flows and to provide additional information about the potential usefulness of ON RRP operations to affect market interest rates when doing so becomes appropriate.
 A few participants suggested that it would be useful to evaluate the potential role of an ON RRP facility in the context of the Committee’s plans for monetary policy implementation over the medium and longer term.
" Participants were most concerned about the marginal cost of additional asset purchases arising from risks to financial stability, pointing out that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy could provide an incentive for excessive risktaking in the financial sector."
 It was noted that the risks to financial stability could be somewhat larger in the case of asset pu rchases than in the case of interest rate policy because purchases work in part by affecting term premiums and policymakers have less experience with term premium effects than with more conventional interest rate policy.
Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information reviewed for the December 17–18 meeting indicated that economic activity was expanding at a moderate pace.
" Total payroll employment increased further, and the unemployment rate declined but remained elevated."
" Co nsumer price inflation continued to run below the Committee’s objective,       although measures of longerrun inflation expectations remained stable."
  Total nonfarm payroll employment rose in October and November at a faster monthly pace than in the previous two quarters.
" The unemployment rate declined, on net, from 7.2 percent in September to        7.0 percent in November."
" The labor force participation rate also decreased, on balance, and the            employmentto-population ratio in November was the same as in September."
" The share of workers employed part time for economic reasons  declined slightly while the rate of longduration unemployment was little changed, but both measures were still high."
" The rate of job openings edged up in recent months, the share of small businesses reporting that they had hardto-fill positions increased, and the fourweek moving average of initial claims for unemployment insurance trended down, on net, over the intermeeting period, although the rate of gross privatesector hiring was still somewhat low."
  Growth in real private expenditures for business equipment and intellectual property products was subdued in the third quarter.
    The U.S. international trade deficit narrowed in October as exports rose more than imports.
" Total U.S. consumer price inflation, as measured by the PCE price index, was less than 1 percent over the       12 months ending in October, in part because consumer energy prices declined over the same 12month period."
" In addition, core PCE price inflation—which excludes consumer energy and food prices—was only a little above 1 percent, partly reflecting subdued  increases in medical services prices and recent declines in the prices of many nonfuel imported goods."
" Both nearterm and longerterm inflation expectations from the Michigan survey were little changed, on net, in November and early December."
"Compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector rose moderately over the year ending in the third quarter, and unit labor costs moved up at a similar pace as gains in productivity were small."
 The employment cost index expanded a little more slowly than the compensation per hour measure over the same yearlong period.
"          Foreign economic activity strengthened in the third quarter, as the euro area co ntinued to recover from its recent recession, economic growth picked up in China after slowing in the first half of the year, and the Mexican economy rebounded from a secondquarter contraction."
" Inflation slowed recently in many advanced foreign economies, partly as a result of a deceleration in prices for energy and other commodities."
" Monetary policy remained very accommo dative in most advanced economies, but central banks in some emerging market economies recently tightened policy further to contain inflation and support the foreign exchange value of their currencies."
Staff Review of the Financial Situation Financial market developments over the intermeeting period appeared to be driven largely by incoming data on employment and economic activity that exceeded investor expectations as well as by Federal Reserve communications.
" On net, judging by financial market quotes on interest rate futures, the expected federal funds rate path through the end of 2015 moved only slightly since the Page 4Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________   October FOMC meeting."
" The measure of 5year inflation compensation based on Treasury inflationprotected securities dipped 5 basis points, while the 5year forward measure increased       7 basis points."
 Responses to the December 2013 Senior Credit Of ficer Opinion Survey on Dealer Financing Terms (SCOOS) suggested that demand for funding for CMBS picked up since September.
"Bank credit rose slightly in October and November, as growth in commercial and industrial loans, CRE loans, and consumer loans was partially offset by declines in the outstanding balances of closedend residential mortgages on banks’ books."
The foreign exchange value of the dollar appreciated following the October FOMC meeting and the October employment report and ended the intermeeting period higher on balance.
" A shift in market expectations toward easier monetary policy abroad may have also boosted the exchange value of the dollar, most notably against the Japanese yen, and equity prices in Japan rose substantially further during the period."
" Yields on German sovereign bonds, which reacted to a policy rate cut by the European Central Bank and the release of data showing lowerthan-expected euroarea inflation, were only slightly higher on net."
" Relatively st rong capital profiles of large domestic banking firms, low levels and moderate growth of aggregate credit in the nonfinancial sectors, and some reduction in reliance on shortterm wholesale funding across the financial s ector were seen as factors supporting financial stability in the current environment."
" Staff Economic Outlook In the economic projection prepared by the staff for the December FOMC meeting, the forecast for growth in real gross domestic product (GDP) in the second half of this year was revised up a little from the one prepared for the previous meeting, as the recent information on private domestic final demand—particularly consumer spending—was somewhat better, on balance, than the staff had anticipated."
" The staff’s mediumterm forecast for real GDP growth was also revised up slightly, reflecting a small reduction in fiscal restraint from the recent federal budget agreement, which the staff assumed would be enacted; a lower anticipated trajectory for longerterm interest rates; and higher paths for equity values and home prices."
 The staff continued to project that real GDP would expand more quickly over the next few years than it has this year and would rise significantly faster than the growth rate of potential output.
" This acceleration in economic activity was expected to be supported by an easing in the effects of fiscal policy restraint on economic growth, increases in consumer and bu siness sentiment, continued improvements in credit availability and financial conditions, a further easing of the economic stresses in Europe, and stillaccommodative monetary policy."
" The expansion in economic activity was anticipated to slowly reduce resource slack over the projection period, and the unemployment rate was expected to decline gradually to the staff’s estimate of its longerrun natural rate."
 The nearterm forecast for inflation was revised down slightly to reflect some recent softerthan-expected data.
" The staff continued to forecast that inflation would be modest, on net, through early next year but higher than its low level in the first half of this year."
 The staff’s projection for inflation over the medium term was essentially unchanged.
" With longerrun inflation expectations assumed to remain stable, changes in commodity and import prices expected to be measured, and slack in labor and product markets persisting over most of the projection period, inflation was projected to be subdued through 2016."
The staff viewed the uncertainty around the projection for economic activity as similar to its average over the past 20 years.
" Nonetheless, the risks to th e forecast for real GDP growth were viewed as tilted to the downside, reflecting concerns th at the extent of supplyside damage to the economy since the recession could prove greater than assumed; that the tightening in mortgage rates since last spring could exert greater restraint on the housing recovery than had been projected; that economic and financial stresses in emerging market economies and the euro area could intensify; and that, with the target federal funds rate already near its lower bound, the U.S. economy was not well positioned to weather future ad verse shocks."
" However, the staff viewed the risks around the projection for the unemployment rate as roughly balanced, with the risk of a higher unemployment rate resulting from adverse developments roughly countered by the possibility that the unemployment rate could continue to fall more than expected, as it had in recent years."
" The staff did not see the uncertainty around its outlook for inflation as unusually high, and the risks to that outlook were viewed as broadly balanced."
"  Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook  In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, the meeting participants—5 members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks, all of whom participated in the deliberations—submitted their assessments of real output growth, the unemployment rate, inflation, and the target federal funds rate for each year from 2013 through 2016 and over the longer run, under each participant’s judgment of appropriate monetary policy."
" The longerrun projections represent each participant’s assessment of the rate to Page 6Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________   which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy."
" They generally indicated that the broad contours of their outlook for real activity, the labor market, and inflation had not changed materially since their October meeting, but most expressed greater confidence in the outlook and saw the risks associ ated with their forecasts of real GDP growth and the unemployment rate as more nearly balanced than  earlier in the year."
" Almost all participants continued to project that the rate of growth of economic activity would strengthen in coming years, and all anticipated that the unemployment rate would gradually decline toward leve ls consistent with their current assessments of its longerrun normal value."
" The projected improvement in  economic activity was expected to be supported by highly accommodative monetary policy, diminished fiscal policy restraint, and a pickup in global economic growth, as well as a further easing of credit conditions and continued improvements in household balance sheets."
 Inflation remained below the Committee’s longerrun objective over the intermeeting period.
" Nevert heless, participants still anticipated that with longerrun inflation expectations stable and economic activity picking up, inflation would move back toward its objective over the medium run."
 But they noted that inflation persistently below the Committee’s objective would pose risks to economic performance and so saw a need to monitor inflation developments carefully.
" More broadly, spending was being supported by gains in household wealth associated with rising house prices and equity values, the stilllow level of interest rates, and the    progress that households have made in reducing debt and strengthening their balance sheets."
 These favorable trends were generally anti cipated to continue and to be accompanied by stronger real disposable income as labor market conditions improve and inflation remains low.
 Some participants noted that the increase in mortgage interest rates since the spri ng was having a greater effect on that sector than they had anticipated earlier.
" These included expectations that mortgage interest rates would remain relatively favorable, that rising home values would boost household wealth and further reduce the number of borrowers with underwater mortgages, that consumer incomes and confidence wo uld continue to rise as employment expanded, and that a pickup in household formation would support the demand for housing."
" Renewed export demand and a buildup in auto inventories, which may be reversed in 2014, were cited as contributing to the recent gains in production."
Fiscal policy continued to restrain economic growth.
"Committee participants generally viewed the increases in nonfarm payroll employ ment of more than 200,000 per month in October and November and the decline in the unemployment rate to 7 percent as encouraging signs of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions."
" Several cited other in dicators of progress in the labor market, such as the decline in new claims for unemployment insurance, the uptrend in quits, or the rise in the number of small businesses reporting job openings that were hard to fill."
" However, several others continued to see important elements of cyclical weakness in the low labor force partic ipation rate and cited other indicators of considerable slack in the labor market, including the stillhigh levels of longduration unemployment and of workers employed part time for economic reasons and the stilldepressed ratio of employment to population for worker s ages 25 to 54."
 A few participants noted the risk that the persistent weakness in labor force participation and low rates of productivity growth might indicate lasting structural economic damage from the financial crisis and ensuing recession.
"Inflation continued to run noticeably below the Committee’s longerrun objective of 2 percent, but participants anticipated that it would move back toward        2 percent over time as the economic recovery strengthened and longerrun inflation expectations remained steady."
" Several participants suggested that some of the factors that had held down inflation recently, such as the slowing in price increases for medical care and banking services, were likely to prove transitory."
" Some participants suggested that inflation, while low, was unlikely to slow further, pointing to core, trimmed mean, or stickyprice inflation measures as indicative of fairly steady underlying price trends; most measures of wage gains were also  steady."
" Nonetheless, many participants expressed concern about the deceleration in consumer prices over the past year, and a couple pointed out that a number of other advanced economies were also experiencing very low inflation."
 Among the costs of very low or declining inflation that were cited were its effects in raising re al interest rates and debt burdens.
 A few participants  raised the possibility that recent declines in inflation might suggest that the economic recovery was not as st rong as some thought.
 One proposed that the Committee analyze more explicitly the potential consequences of specific risks to the financial system for its dualmandate objectives and take account of the possible effects of monetary policy on such risks in its assessment of appropriate policy.
"Page 8Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________   In their discussion of the appropriate path for monetary policy, participants considered whether the cumulative improvement in labor market conditions since the asset purchase program began in September 2012 and the associated improvement in the outlook for the labor market warranted a reduction in the pace of asset purchases."
" The most recent data showed that increases in nonfarm payroll employment had averaged around 190,000 per month for the past 15 months, and the unemployment rate had fallen more quickly over that period than most participants had expected."
" However, several participants stre ssed that the unemployment rate remained elevated, that a range of other indicators had shown less progress toward levels consistent with a full recovery in the labor ma rket, and that the projected pickup in economic growth was not assured."
 Some participants also questioned whether slowing the pace of purchases at a time when inflation was running well below the Committee’s longerrun objective was appropriate.
" For some, the considerable slack remaining in the labor market and shortfall of inflation from the Committee’s longerrun objective warranted continuing asset purchases at the current pace for a time in order to wait for additional information confirming sustained progress toward the Committee’s objectives or to promote faster progress toward those objectives."
" In general, participants who favored amending the forward guidance saw a need to more fully communicate how, if the unemployment rate threshold was reached first, the Committee would likely set monetary policy after that threshold was crossed."
 A few participants discussed the potential advantages and disadvantages of using medians of the projections of the federal funds rate from the SEP as a means of communicating the likely path of shortterm interest rates.
" In light of their concern that inflation might continue to run well below the Committee’s longerrun objective, several participants saw the need to clearly convey that inflation remains an important consideration in adjusting the target funds rate."
 Participants debated the advantages and disadvantages of lowering the unemployment rate threshold provided in the forward guidance.
" In the view of the few participants who advocated such a change, a lower threshold would be a clear signal of the Committee’s intentions and was an appropriate adjustment in light of recent labor market and inflation trends."
 Most were inclined to retain the current thresholds for the unemployment and inflation rates and to instead provide qualitative guidance regarding the Commi ttee’s likely behavior after a threshold was crossed.
" Labor market conditions had improved in recent months, with monthly gains in payroll employment of more than 200,000 in October an d November."
 The unemployment rate had declined but remained elevated.
" Fiscal policy was restraining economic growth, although the extent of the restraint may have begun to diminish."
" The Committee expected that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic growth would strengthen and the unemployment rate would gradually decline toward levels consistent with its dual mandate."
" Moreover, members judged that the risks to the outlook for the economy and the labor market had become more nearly balanced, reflecting in part an easing of fiscal policy concerns and an improvement in the prospects for global economic growth."
" Inflation was running below the Committee’s longerrun objective, and this was seen as posing possible risks to economic performance."
" Members anticipated that inflation would, over time, return to the Committee’s 2 percent objective, supported by stable inflation expectations and stronger economic activity."
" However, in light of their concerns about the persistence of low inflation, many members saw a need for the Committee to monitor inflation developments carefully for ev idence that inflation was moving back toward its longerrun objective."
"In their discussion of monetary policy in the period ahead, most members agreed that the cumulative improvement in labor market conditions and the likelihood that the improvement would be sustained indicated that the Committee could appropriately begin to slow the pace of its asset purchases at this meeting."
" However, members also weighed a number of considerations regarding such an action, including their degree of confidence in prospects for sustained abovepotential economic growth, continued improvement in labor market conditions, and a return of  inflation to its mandateconsistent level over time."
 Members also stressed the need to underscore that the pace of asset purchases was not on a preset course and would remain contingent on the Committee’s outlook for the labor market and inflation as well as its assessment of  the efficacy and costs of purchases.
" While deciding to modestly reduce its pace of purchases, the Committee emphasized that its holdings of longerterm securities were sizable and would still be increasing, which would promote a stronger economic recovery by maintaining downward pressure on longer -term interest rates, supporting mortgage markets, and helping to make broader financial conditions more accommodative."
" In the view of one member, a reduction in the pace of purchases was premature and, before taking such a step, the Committee should wait for more convincing evidence that economic growth  was rising faster than its potential and that inflation would return to the Committee’s 2 percent objective."
"  In their discussion of forward guidance about the target federal funds rate, a few members suggested that lowering the unemployment threshold to 6 percent could effectively convey the Committee’s intention to keep the target federal funds rate low for an extended period."
 A number of members thought that the forward guidance should em phasize the importance of inflation as a factor in their decisions.
" Accordingly, almost all members agreed to add language indicating the Committee’s anticipation, based on its current assessment of additional measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments, that it would be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate well past the time that the unemployment rate declines below 6½ percent, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee’s longerrun objective."
" However, those concerns generally were seen as outweighed by the benefit of avoiding tying the Committee’s decision too closely to the unemployment rate alone, while Page 10Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________   still being clear about the Committee’s intention to provide the monetary accommodation needed to support a return to maximum employment and stable prices."
"  At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct  the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: “Consistent with its st atutory mandate, the Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster maximum employment and price stability."
 The System Open Market Account Manager and the Secretary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the System’s balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the Committee’s objectives of maximum employment and price stability.” The vote encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p.m.: “Information received since the Federal Open Market Committ ee met in October indicates that economic activity is expanding at a moderate pace.
 Labor market conditions have shown further improvement; the unemployment rate has declined but remains elevated.
" Fiscal policy is restraining economic growth, although  the extent of restraint may be diminishing."
" Inflation has been running below the Committee’s longerrun objective, but longerterm inflation expectations have remained stable."
"Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
" The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic growth will pick up from its recent pace and the unemployment rate will gradually decline toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate."
" The Committee recognizes that inflation persistently below its 2 percent objective could pose risks to economic performance, and it is monitoring inflation developments carefully for evidence that inflation will move back toward its objective over the medium term."
"Taking into account the extent of federal fiscal retrenchment since the inception of its current asset purchase program, the Committee sees the improvement in economic activity and labor market conditions over that period as consistent with growing underlying strength in the broader economy."
" In light of the cumulative progress toward maximum employment and the improvement in the outlook for labor market conditions, the Committee decided to modestly reduce the pace of its asset purchases."
" The Committee’s sizable and Minutes of the Meeting of December 17–18, 2013Page 11_____________________________________________________________________________________________   stillincreasing holdings of longerterm securities should maintain downward pressure on longerterm interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative, which in turn should promote a stronger economic recovery and help to ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with the Committee’s dual mandate."
" If incoming information broadly supports the Committee’s expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back toward its longerrun objective, the Committee will likely reduce the pace of asset purchases in further measured steps at future meetings."
" However, asset purchases are not on a preset course, and the Committee’s decisions about their pace will remain contingent on the Committee’s outlook for the labor market and inflation as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases."
"To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee today reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropr iate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens."
" The Committee also reaffirmed its expectation that the current exceptionally low target range for the federal funds r ate of 0 to        ¼ percent will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above    6½ percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee’s       2 percent longerrun goal, and longerterm inflation expectations continue to be well anchored."
" In determining how long to maintain a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy, the Committee will also consider other information, including additional measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings  on financial developments."
" The Committee now anticipates, based on its assessment of these factors, that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate well past the time that the unemployment rate declines below 6½ percent, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee’s 2 percent longerrun goal."
" When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longerrun goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent.” Voting for this action:  Ben Bernanke, William C."
" In his view, with the unemployment rate still elevated and the inflation rate well below the Committee’s longerrun objective of 2 percent, changes in the asset purchase prog ram should be postponed until incoming data more clearly indicate that economic growth is likely to be sustained above its potential rate."
"English Secretary  Page 12Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________   Summary of Economic Projections In conjunction with the December 17–18, 2013, Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, meeting participants—5 members of the Board of Governors and the 12 presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks, all of whom participated in the deliberations—submitted their assessments of real output growth, the unemployment rate, inflation, and the target federal funds rate for each year from 2013 through 2016 and over the longer run."
 Each partic ipant’s assessment was based on information available at the time of the meeting plus his or her judgment of appropriate monetary policy and assumptions about the factors likely to affect economic outcomes.
" The longerrun projections represent each participant’s judgment of the value to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy."
 “Appropriate monetary policy” is defined as the futu re path of policy that each participant deems most likely to foster outcomes for economic activity and inflation that best satisfy his or her individual interpretation of the Federal Reserve’s objectives of maximum employment and stable prices.
"Overall, FOMC participants  expected, under appropriate monetary policy, that economic growth would pick up, on average, over the next three years, with the unemployment rate declining gradually (table 1 and figure 1)."
" Almost all of the participants projected that inflation, as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), would rise to a level at or slightly below the Committee’s 2 percent objective in 2016."
Most participants expected that highly accommodative monetary policy would remain  warranted over the next few years to foster progre ss toward the Federal Reserve’s longerrun objectives.
"Most participants saw the uncertainty associated with their outlook for economic growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as similar to that of the past 20 years."
" In addition, most participants considered the risks to the outlook for real gross domestic product (GDP), the unemployment rate, and inflation to be broadly balanced, although a few saw the risks to their inflation forecasts as tilted to the downside."

 Projections for the unemployment r ate are for the average civilian unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of  the year indicated.
 Longerrun projec tions represent each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to  converge under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy.

" Subsequently, in 2016,  real GDP growth would begin to converge back to a pace that participants saw as the longerrun rate of output growth."
" Participants pointed to a number of factors contributing to the pickup in growth in the near term, including diminishing restraint from fiscal policy, pentup demand for consumer and producer durables, rising household net worth, stronger growth abroad, and accommodative monetary policy."
" A number of participants noted that growth in residential invest ment had slowed some recently as a result of higher mortgage rates, but they expected growth to strengthen  beginning in 2014."
" Several participants also noted a slowdown in the growth of business investment but saw growth picking up over the forecast horizon, reflecting an expected acceleration in sales."
" The central tendencies of participants’ projections for real GDP growth were 2.2 to 2.3 percent in 2013,      2.8 to 3.2 percent in 2014, 3.0 to 3.4 percent in 2015, and 2.5 to 3.2 percent in 2016."
 The central tendency for the longerrun rate of growth of real GDP was    2.2 to 2.4 percent.
Participants anticipated a gradual decline in the unemployment rate over the projection period.
" The central tendencies of participants’ forecasts for the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of each year were 7.0 to 7.1 percent in 2013, 6.3 to 6.6 percent in 2014, 5.8 to 6.1 percent in 2015, and 5.3 to 5.8 percent in 2016."
" Nearly all participants made a modest downward revision to their projected path for the unemployment rate, reflecting its recent largerthan-expected decline; however, the central tendency of participants’ estimates of the longerrun normal rate of unemployment that would prevail under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy was unchanged at 5.2 to 5.8 percent."
 A majority of participants projected that the unemployment rate would be near or slightly above their individual estimates of its longerrun level at the end of 2016.
 Figures 3.A and 3.B show th at participants’ views regarding the likely outcomes for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate remained dispersed.
" The diversity evidently reflected their individual assessments of the likely rate at which the restraint from fiscal policy will diminish and demand fo r consumer and producer durables will recover, the anticipated path for foreign economic activity, the trajectory for growth in household net worth, and the appropriate path of monetary policy."
" Relative to September, the dispersions of participants’ projections for GDP growth in 2014 and beyond were about unchanged, while dispersions of the projections for the unemployment rate narrowed some through 2015."
" The Outlook for Inflation Participants’ views on the broad outlook for inflation under the assumption of appropriate monetary policy were marked down a bit in 2013 and 2014 from those in their September projections, but the central tendencies for 2015 and beyond were similar."
" All participants anticipated that, on average, both headline and core inflation would rise graduall y over the next few years, and a large majority of participants expected headline inflation to be at or slightly below the Committee’s      2 percent objective in 2016."
" Specifically, the central tendencies for PCE inflation were 0.9 to 1.0 percent in 2013, 1.4 to 1.6 percent in 2014, 1.5 to 2.0 percent in 2015, and 1.7 to 2.0 percent in 2016."
 The central tendencies of the forecasts for core inflation were slightly lower over the projection period than in September and broadly similar to those for the headline measure.
 A number of participants viewed the combination of stable inflation expectations and diminishing resource slack as likely to contribute to a gradual rise of inflation back toward the Committee’s longerrun objective.
  Figures 3.C and 3.D provide information on the diversity of participants’ views about the outlook for inflation.
" In 2016, the forecasts for PC E inflation were concentrated near the Committee’ s longerrun objective, though one participant expected inflation to be ¼ percentage point above the Committee’s objective and another three expected it to be almost ½ percentage point below."
" Similar to the projections for headline inflation, the projections for core inflation also were concentrated near 2 percent in 2016."

"All participants projected that the unemployment rate would be below the Committee’s 6½ percent threshold at the end of the year in which they viewed the initial increase in the federal funds rate to be appropriate, and all but one judged that inflation would be at or below the Committee’s longerrun objective."
 Almost all participants projected that the unemployment rate would remain above their view of its longerrun normal level at the end of the year in which they saw the federal funds rate increasing from the effective lower bound.
" Among all participants, estimates of the longerrun target federal funds rate ranged from 3½ to about 4¼ percent, reflecting the Committee’s inflation objective of 2 per cent and participants’ individual judgments about the appropriate longerrun level of the real federal funds rate in the absence of further shocks to the economy."
"Participants’ views of the appropriate path for monetary policy were informed by their judgments on the state of the economy, includ ing the values of the unemployment rate and other la bor market indicators that would be consistent with maximum employment, the extent to which the economy was currently falling short of maximum employment, the prospects for inflation to reach the Committee’s longerterm objective of       2 percent, and the balance of risks around the outlook."
 A few participants also mentioned using various monetary policy rules to guide their thinking on the appropriate path for the federal funds rate.
"Uncertainty and Risks Nearly all participants judged that the levels of uncertainty about their projections for real GDP growth and unemployment were broadly similar to the norm during the previous 20 years, althou gh three participants continued to see them as higher (figure 4).1  More participants than in September judged the risks to real GDP growth and the unemployment rate to be broadly balanced."
" A range of factors was cited as contributing to this change in view, including an improved outlook for global financial and economic conditions, a moderation in geopolitical risks, an upgraded assessment of the prospects for consumption growth, and reduced odds of a fiscal impasse."
"                                                   1 Table 2 provides estimates of the forecast uncertainty for the change in real GDP, the unemployment rate, and total consumer price inflation over  the period from 1993 through 2012."

 Most partic ipants judged the levels of uncertainty associated with their forecasts for the two inflation measures to be broadly similar to historical norms and the risks to those projections as broadly balanced.
" Four participants saw the risks to their inflation forecasts as tilted to the downside, reflecting, for example, the possibility that the current low levels of inflation could prove more persistent than anticipated."
" Conversely, one participant ci ted upside risks to inflation stemming from uncertainty about the timing and efficacy of the Committee’s withdrawal of accommodation."

" As described in the box “Forecast Uncertainty,” under certain assumptions, there is about a 70 percent probability that actual outcomes for real GDP, un employment, and c onsumer prices will be in ranges implied by the average size of projection errors made in the past."
Page 12Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________              Forecast Uncertainty    The economic projections provided by the members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks inform discussions of monetary policy among policymakers and can aid public understanding of the basis for policy actions.
" Thus, in setting the stance of monetary policy, participants consider no t only what appears to be the most likely economic outcome as embodied in their projections, but also the range of alternative possibilities, the likelihood of their occurring, and the potential costs to the economy should they occur."
"Table 2 summarizes the average historical accuracy of a range of forecasts, including those reported in past Monetary Policy Report s and those prepared by the Federal Reserve Board’s staff in advance of meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee."
" The corresponding 70 percent confidence intervals for overall inflation would be 1.7 to  2.3 percent in the current year, 1.1 to 2.9 percent in the second year, and 1.0 to 3.0 percent in the third and fourth years."
"As with real activity and inflation, the outlook for the future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable uncertainty."
 This uncertainty arises primarily because each participant’s assessment of the appropriate stance of monetary policy depends importantly on the evolution of real activity and inflation over time.
