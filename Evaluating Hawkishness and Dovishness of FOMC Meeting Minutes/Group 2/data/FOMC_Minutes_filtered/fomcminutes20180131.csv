" Any such adjustment described in subparagraph A of this paragraph  5 shall be made in the context of the Committee ’s discussion and decision about the stance of policy at its most recent meeting and the Committee ’s longrun objectives to foster maximum employment and price stability, and shall be based on economic, financial, and monetary developments since the most recent meeting of the Committee."
" __________________________  1 In general, as specified in Article IV, each member of the IMF undertakes to collaborate with the IMF and other members to assure orderly exchange arrangements and to promote a stable system of exchange rates."
 These obligations include seeking to direct the member ’s economic and financial policies toward the objective of fostering orderly economic growth with reasonable price stability.
 These obligations also include avoiding manipulating exchange rates or the international monetary system in such a way that would impede effective balance of payments adjustment or to give an unfair competitive advantage over other members.
"  In the Committee ’s annual reconsideration of the Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, participants agreed that only a minor revision was required at this meeting, which was to update the reference to the median of FOMC participants ’ estimates of the longer -run normal rate of unemployment from 4.8 percent  to 4.6 percent ."
" STATEMENT ON LONGER -RUN GOALS AND MONETARY POLICY STRATEGY  (As amended effective January 30, 2018)   The Federal Op en Market Committee (FOMC) is firmly committed to fulfilling its statutory mandate from the Congress of promoting maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long -term interest rates."
 The Committee seeks to explain its monetary policy decisions to the  public as clearly as possible.
" Such clarity facilitates well -informed decisionmaking by households and businesses, reduces economic and financial uncertainty, increases the effectiveness of monetary policy, and enhances transparency and accountability, which are essential in a democratic society."
" Inflation, employment, and long -term interest rates fluctuate over time in response to economic and financial disturbances."
" Moreover, monetary policy actions tend to influence economic activity and prices with a lag."
" The inflation rate over the longer run is primarily determined by monetary policy, and hence the Committee has the ability to specify a longer -run goal for inflation."
" The Committee reaffirms its judgment that inflation at the rate of 2  percent , as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, is most consistent over the longer run with the Federal Reserve’ s statutory mandate."
 The Committee would be concerned if inflation were running persistently above or below this objective.
" Communicating this symmetric inflation goal clearly to the public helps keep longer -term inflation expectations firmly anchored, thereby fostering price stability and moderate long -term interest rates and enhancing the Committee ’s ability to promote maximum employment in the face of significant economic disturbances."
 The maximum level of employment is largely determined by nonmonetary factors that affect the structure and dynamics of the labor market.
" Consequently, it would not be appropriate to specify a fixed goal for employment; rather, the Committee ’s policy decisions must be informed by assessments of the maximum level of employment, recognizing that such assessments ar e necessarily uncertain and subject to revision."
 Information about Committee participants ’ estimates of the longer -run normal rates of output growth and unemployment is publi shed four times per year in the FOMC ’s Summary of Economic Projections.
" For example, in the most recent projections, the median of FOMC participants ’ estimates of the longer -run normal rate of unemployment was 4.6  percent ."
" In setting monetary policy, the  Committee seeks to mitigate deviations of inflation from its longer -run goal and deviations of employment from the Committee ’s assessments of its maximum level."
" However, under circumstances in which the Comm ittee judges that the objectives are not complementary, it follows a balanced approach in promoting them, taking into account the magnitude of the deviations and the potentially different time horizons over which employment and inflation are projected to r eturn to levels judged consistent with its mandate."
 Breakeven measures of inflation compensation derived from Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) moved up but remained low.
 Survey measures of longer -term inflation expectations showed little change.
" Judging fro m interest rate futures, the expected path of the federal funds rate shifted up over the period but continued to imply a gradual expected pace of policy firming ."
 Inflation Analysis and Forecasting  The staff presented three briefings on inflation analysis and forecasting.
 These  included  structural models in which the rate of inflation is linked importantly to measures of resource slack and a measure of expected inflation relevant for wage and price setting— socalled Phillips curve specifications —as well as statistical models in which inflation is primarily determined by a time -varying inflation trend or longer -run inflation expectations.
" The staff presentations considered two key channels by which monetary policy influences inflation—the response of inflation to changes in resource utilization and the role of inflation expectations, or trend inflation, in the price -setting process."
" In part because  inflation was importantly influenced by  a number of shortlived factors, t he effects of current and expected resource utilization gaps on inflation were not easy to discern empirically."
" The briefings highlighted a number of other challenges associated with estimating the strength and timing of the linkage between resource utilization and inflation, including the reliability of and changes over time in estimates of the natural rate of unemployment and potential output and the ability to adequately account for supply shocks."
" In addition, some research suggested that the relationship between resource utilization and inflation may be nonlinear, with the response of inflation increasing as rates of utilization rise to very high levels."
" With regard to  inflation expectations , two of t he briefings presented findings that the longer -run trend in inflation , absen t cyclical disturbances or transitory fluctuations,  had been stable in recent years at a little below 2 percent ."
" The briefings reported that the average forecasting performance o f models employing either statistical estimates of inflation trends or survey -based measures of inflation expectations as proxies for inflation expectations appeared comparable, even though different versions of such models could yield very differMinutes of the Meeting of January 30–31, 2018_                                                                                                                                                                              Page 9ent forecasts at any given point in time."
" Moreover, al -though survey -based measures of longer -run inflation expectations tended to move in parallel with estimated inflation trends, the empirical research provided no clear guidance on how to construct a measure of inflation expectations that would be the most useful for inflation forecasting."
" The staff noted that al though  reduced -form models in which inflation tends to revert toward longer -run inflation trends described the data reasonably well, those models offer ed little guidance to policymakers on how to conduct policy so as to achieve their desired outcome for inflation."
" Following the staff presentations, participants discussed how the inflation frameworks reviewed in the briefings informed their views on inflation and monetary policy."
 Almost all participants who commented agreed that a Phillips curve –type of inflation framework remained useful as one of their tools for understanding inflation dynamics and informing their decisions on monetary policy.
 Policymakers pointed to a number of possible reasons for the difficulty in estimating the link between resource utilization and inflation in recent years .
" These reasons  included an extended period of low and stable inflation  in the United States and other advanced economies  during which the effects of  resource utilization on inflation became  harder to identify , the shortcomings of commonly  used measures of resource gaps , the effects of transitory changes in relative prices, and structura l factors that had made business pricing more competitive or prices more flexible  over time."
 It was noted that research focusing on inflation across U.S. states or metropolitan areas continued to find a significant relationship between price or wage inflation and measures of resource gaps .
" A couple of  participants questioned the usefulness of a Phillips curve –type framework for policymaking, citing the limited ability of such frameworks to capture the relationship between economic activity  and inflation ."
"Participants generally agreed that inflation expectations played a fundamental role in understanding and forecasting inflation, with stable inflation expectations providing an important anchor for the rate of inflation over the longer run."
" Participants ac knowledged that the causes of movements in short - and longer -run inflation expectations, including the role of monetary policy, were imperfectly understood."
" They commented that various proxies for  inflation expectations —readings from household and busines s surveys or from economic forecasters, estimates derived from market prices, or estimated trends —we re imperfect measures of actual inflation expectations, which  are unobservable."
" That said, participants emphasized the critical need for the FOMC to mainta in a credible longer -run inflation objective and to clearly  communicate the Committee ’s commitment to achieving that objective."
 Several participants indicated that they viewed the available evidence  as suggest ing that longer -run inflation expectations remained  well anchored ; one cited recent research find ing that inflation expectations had become better anchored following the Committee’s adoption of a numerical inflation target.
" However, a  few saw low levels of inflation  over recent years  as reflect ing, in part, slippage in longer -run inflation expectations below the Committee ’s 2 percent  objective."
" In that regard, a number of participants noted the importance of continuing to emphasize that the Committee ’s 2 percent  inflation objective is symmetric."
" A few  other participants suggested that the FOMC could  begin to examine whether adopting a monetary policy framework in which the Committee would strive to make up for past deviations of inflation from target might address the challenge of achieving and maintaining inflation expectations consistent with the Committee ’s inflation objective , particularly in an environment in which the neutral rate of interest appeared likely to remain low ."
" Growth of real final domestic purchases by households and businesses, generally a good indicator of the economy ’s underlying momentum, was solid."
" Consumer price inflation, as measured by the 12 -month  percent age change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), remained below 2  percent  in December."
  Survey -based measures of longer -run inflation expectations were little changed on balance.
" Total nonfarm payroll employment increased solidly in December, and the national unemployment rate remained at 4.1  percent ."
" The unemployment rates for Hispanics, for Asians, and for African America ns were lower than earlier in the year and close to the levels seen just before the most recent recession."
" The rates of private -sector job openings and quits were little changed in November, and the four -week moving average of in itial claims for unemployment insurance benefits continued to be at a low level in mid -January."
 Both the employment cost index for private -sector workers and average hourly earnings for all employees rose about 2½ percent  over the 12  months ending in December.
" Recent readings on key factors that influence consumer spending —including gains in employment, real disposable personal income, and households ’ net worth —continued to be supportive of further solid growth of real PCE in the near term."
 The nominal U.S. international trade deficit widened further in November after widening sharply in October.
 Available data for goods trade in December suggested that import growth again outpaced export growt h.
" All told, real net exports were estimated to be a substantial drag on real GDP growth in the fourth quarter."
" Core PCE pri ce inflation, which excludes changes in consumer food and energy prices, was 1½  percent  over that same period."
" The consumer price index (CPI) rose around 2  percent  over the same period, while core CPI inflation was 1¾  percent."
 Recent readings on surveyb ased measures of longer -run inflation expectations —including those from the Michigan survey and the Desk ’s Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants —were little changed on balance.
 Incoming data suggested that economic activity abroad continued to expand at a solid pace and that this expansion was broad  based across countries.
  Economic growth remained solid in China but cooled off a bit in some emerging Asian economies after a very strong thirdquarter performance.
"  Inflation in both AFEs and EMEs picked up significantly in the fourth quarter, largely reflecting  a boost from rising oil prices."
" Inflation excluding food and energy prices remained well below central bank targets in several economies , including the euro area and Japan."
" A strengthening outlook for economic growth  in the United States and abroad, along w ith recently enacted tax legislation, Minutes of the Meeting of January 30–31, 2018_                                                                                                                                                                              Page 11appeared to boost investor sentiment."
" U.S. equity prices, Treasury yields, and market -based measures of inflation compensation rose, and spreads of yields on investmentand speculative -grade nonfinancial corporate bonds over those for comparable -maturity Treasury securities narrowed further."
" In addition, the dollar depreciated broadly amid strong foreign economic data and monetary policy communications by some foreign central banks that investors reportedly viewed as  less accommodative than expected."
 FOMC communications over the intermeeting period were generally characterized by market participants as consistent with their expectations for continued gradual removal of monetary policy accommodation.
 The nominal Treasury yield curve shifted up over the intermeeting period amid an improved outlook for domestic and foreign economic growth.
" Measures of inflation compensation based on TIPS  fell in response to the soft reading on core inflation in the November CPI release but subsequently moved up against the backdrop of an improving global growth outlook, higher commodity prices, depreciation of the dollar, and the stronger -thanexpected re ading on core inflation in the December CPI release."
" On net, inflation compensation moved up at both the 5 -year and the 5to-10year horizons , and both measures returned to levels seen in early 2017 before the  string of generally weaker -thanexpected infl ation readings."
" The Bank of England, the Ban k of Japan, and the European Central Bank (ECB) left their monetary policy stances unchanged, as expected."
" Nonetheless, the ECB president ’s optimistic assessment of the euroarea economy at the press  conference following the January meeting was interprete d by market participants as a signal that monetary policy would be less accommodative than expected ."
" That said, market -based measur es of policy expectations continue d to indicate that investors anticipate a gradual pace of monetary policy normalization in the euro area."
 Financing conditions for nonfinancial businesses and households remained generally accommodative over the intermeeti ng period and continued to be supportive of economic activity.
" Net debt financing by investment -grade nonfinancial corporations turned negative in December, but the weakness appeared to reflect a softening in the demand for credit, possibly related to the anticipation of higher after -tax cash flows and repatriation of foreign earnings ."
 Credit market conditions for small businesses remained relatively accommodative despite sluggish credit growth among these firms.
" In commercial real estate (CRE) markets, growth of loans held by banks slowed further in the fourth quarter, though CRE loans held by small banks and some types of CRE loans held by large banks —construction and land development loans in particular —expanded at a more robust pace."
 Conditions in cons umer credit markets remained largely supportive of economic activity.
" In contrast, growth of auto lending slowed in recent months, consistent with the weakening demand for such loans in the fourth quarter as reported in the January SLOOS."
" Beyond 2017, the forecast for real GDP growth was revised up , reflecting a reassessment of the recently  enacted tax cuts,  along with higher projected paths for equity prices and foreign economic growth and  a lower assumed path for the foreign exchange value of the dollar."
 Real GDP was projected to increase at a somewhat faster p ace than potential output through 2020; the staff continued to assume that the recently  enacted tax cuts would boost real GDP growth moderately  over the medium term.
 The unemployment rate was projected to decline further over the next few years and to con tinue to run well below the staff’s estimate of its longer -run natural  rate over this period.
 Estimates of total and core PCE price inflation for 2017 were in line with the staff ’s previous forecast.
" The projection for inflation over the medium term was revised up slightly, primarily reflecting tighter resource utilization in the January forecast."
" Total PCE price inflation in 2018 was projected to be somewhat faster than in 2017 despite a slower projected pace of increases in consumer energy prices; core PCE prices were forecast to rise notably faster in 2018, importantly reflecting both the expected waning of transitory factors that held down 12month measures of inflation in 2017 as well as the projected further tightening in resource utilization."
 The staff projected that core inflation would reach 2  percent  in 2019 and that total inflation would be at the Committee’s 2 percent  objective in 2020.
"The staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as similar to the average of the past 20  years."
" The staff saw the risks to the forecasts for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate Minutes of the Meeting of January 30–31, 2018_                                                                                                                                                                              Page 13as balanced."
 The risks to the projection for inflation also were seen as balanced.
 Dow nside risks included the possibilities that longer -term inflation expectations may have edged lower or that the run of soft core inflation readings this year could prove to be more persistent than the staff expected.
 These downside risks were seen as essentially counterbalanced by the upside risk that inflation could increase more than expected in an economy that was projected to move further above its potential.
" Participants ’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook  In their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants agreed that information received since the FOMC met in December indicate d that the labor market continued to strengthen and that economic activity expanded at a solid rate."
" Gains in employment, household spending, and business fixed investment were solid, and the unemployment rate stayed low."
" On a 12 -month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy continued to run below 2  percent ."
" Market -based measures of inflation compensation increased in recent months but remain ed low; survey -based measures of longer -term inflation expectation s were little changed, on balance."
" Participants generally saw incoming information on economic activity and the labor market as consis tent with continued above -trend economic growth  and a further strengthening in labor market conditions , with the recent solid gains in household and business spending  indicating substantial  underlying  economic momentum."
" They  pointed to accommodative financial conditions, the recently enacted tax legislation, and a n improved  global  economic outlook as factors likely to support economic growth over coming quarters ."
" Participants expected that with further gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary po licy, economic activity w ould expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions would remain strong."
 Inflation on a 12 -month basis was expected to move up this year and to stabilize around the Committee ’s 2 percent  objective over the medium term.
" However,  participants  judged that it was important to continue to monitor  inflation developments closely."
" Participants expected the recent solid  growth in consumer spending to continue, supported by further gains in employment and income , increased  household wealth resulting from  higher asset prices, and high levels of consumer confidence ."
" In connection with solid growth in consumer spending, a couple of participants noted that the household  saving rate ha d decline d to its lowest level since 2005, likely driven by buoyant consumer sentiment or expectations that the rise in  household wealth would be sustained ."
" Against a backdrop of higher energy prices and increas ed global demand for crude oil, a couple of  participants revised up their forecasts for energy production in their respective D istricts."
"  Many participants reported that labor market conditions were tight  in their D istricts, evidenced by low unemployment rates, difficulties for employers in filling open positions  or retain ing workers , or some signs of upward pressure on wages ."
" The unemployment rate, at 4.1  percent, had remained near the lowest level seen in the past 20 years."
 It was noted that other labor market indicators—such as the U -6 measure  of unemployment or the share of involuntary parttime employment— had returned to their pre -recession levels .
" A few participants judged  that while the labor market was close to full employment, some margins of slack remained ; these participants  pointed to the employmentto-population ratio  or the labor force participation rate  for prime -age workers , which  remained  below pre -recession  levels , as well as  the absence to date of clear signs of a pickup in aggregate  wage growth ."
" While some participants heard more reports of wage pressur es from their  business contacts  over the intermeeting period, participants generally noted few signs of a broad -based pickup in wage growth in available data."
 It was noted that the pace of wage gains might not increase appreciably if productivity growth remains l ow.
"In their discussion of inflation developments, many participants noted that inflation data in recent months ha d generally pointed to a gradual rise in inflation , as the 12month core PCE price  inflation rose to 1.5  percent  in December , up 0.2 percent age point from the low  recorded in the summer."
"  Meanwhile, total PCE price inflation was 1.7 percent  over the same 12 -month period."
  Participants anticipated that inflation would continue to gradually rise as resource utilization tighten ed further and as wage pressures became more apparent; several  expected that declines in the foreign exchange value of the dollar  in recent months  would also likely help return inflation to 2  percent  over the medium term .
" That said , a few participants posited that the recently enacted corporate tax cuts might lead firms to cut prices in order to remain competitive  or to gain market share, which could result in a transitory drag on inflation."
" With regard to inflation expectations,  available  readings from surveys had been steady and TIPS -based measures of inflation compensation had moved up, al though they remained low."
 Many participants thought that inflation expectations remained well anchored and would support the gradual return of  inflation to the Committee ’s 2 percent objective over the medium term.
" However, a few other  participants pointed to the record of inflation consistently running below the Committee ’s 2 percent  objective over recent years and expressed the concern that longer -run inflation expectation s may have slipped below levels consistent with that objective ."
"  In their consideration  of monetary policy, participants discussed the implications of recent economic and financial developments for the  outlook for economic  growth , labor market conditions , and inflation and , in turn, for the appropriate path of the federal funds rate."
" While participants  continued to expect economic activity to expand at a moderate pace over the medium term, they anticipated that the rate of economic growth in 2018 would exceed their estimates of its sustainable  longer -run pace and that labor market conditions would strengthen further ."
" A number of participants  indicated that they had marked up their forecasts for economic growth in the near term relative to those made for  the December meeting i n light of the strength of recent data on economic activity in the United States  and abroad , continued  accommodative financial conditions , and informatio n suggesting that the effects of recently enacted tax changes —while still uncertain —might be somewhat larger in the near term than previously thought."
"  Several others  suggested that the Minutes of the Meeting of January 30–31, 2018_                                                                                                                                                                              Page 15upside risks to the near -term outlook for economic activity may have increased ."
 A majority of  participants noted that a stronger  outlook for economic growth  raised  the likelihood that further  gradual policy firming would be appropriate .
Almost all participants continued to anticipate that inflation would move up to the Committee ’s 2 percent  objective over the medium term  as economic growth remained above trend and the labor market stayed  strong;  several comment ed that recent developments had increased their confidence in th e outlook for  further progress toward the Committee ’s 2 percent  inflation objective.
" A couple noted that a step -up in the pace of economic growth could tighten labor market conditions even more than they currently anticipated, posing risks to inflation and financial stability associated with substantia lly overshooting full employment."
" However, some participants  saw an appreciable risk that inflation would continue to fall short of the Committee ’s objective."
 These participants saw  little solid evidence that the strength of economic activity and the labor market was showing through to significant wage or inflation  pressures .
 They  judged that the Committee could afford to be patient in deciding whether  to increase  the target range for the federal  funds rate  in order to support further strengthening of  the labor market and allow participants  to assess  whether  incoming information on inflation showed that it was solidly on a track toward the Committee ’s objective.
" For example, the neutral rate, which appeared to have fallen sharply during the Global Financial Crisis  when financial headwinds had restrained demand, might move up more than anticipated as the global economy strengthened ."
" Alternative ly, the longer -run level of the neutral rate might remain low in the absence of  fundamental shifts  in trends in productivit y, demographics, or the demand for safe assets ."
"Committee Policy Action  In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that information received since the Committee met in December indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising at a solid rate ."
" Gains in employment, household spending, and business fixed investment had been solid, and the unemployment rate had stayed low."
" On a 12 -month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy had continued to run below 2  percent ."
" Market -based measures of inflation compensation had increased in recent months but remained low ; survey -based measures of longer -term inflation expectations were little changed, on balance."
" Members expected that, with further gradual adjustments  in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity would expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions would remain strong."
" In their discussion of the economic outlook, most members viewed  the recent data bearing on real economic activity as sug gesting a modestly  stronger nearterm outlook than they had anticipated at their meeting in December ."
" Al though several saw increased upside  risks to the nearterm outlook for economic activity, members generally continued to judge the  risks to that outlook as remaining roughly balanced ."
Most members noted that recent information on inflation along with prospects for a continued solid pace of economic activity provided support for the view that inflation on a 12 -month basis would likely move up in 2018 and stabilize around the Committee ’s 2 percent  objective over the medium term.
" However, a couple of members expressed  concern about the outlook for  inflation, seeing little evidence of a  meaningful  improvement in the underlying trend in inflation , measures of inflation expectations , or wage growth ."
" Several m embers commented that they saw both upside and downside risks to the inflation outlook, and members agreed to continue to monitor inflation developments closely."
" After assessing current conditi ons  and the outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, members voted to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1¼ to 1½  percent ."
" They indicated that the stance of monetary policy remained accommodative, thereby suppor ting strong  labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent  inflation."
 Members agreed that  the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate  would depend on their  assessments of  realized and expected economic conditions relative to the Committee ’s Page 16                                                                                                                                                                              _Federal Open Market Committeeobjectives of maximum employment and 2  percent  inflation.
" They  reiterate d that this assessment w ould take into account a wide range of inf orma tion, including measures of labor market c onditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations , and readings on financial and international developments ."
 Members also agreed to carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to the Committee ’s symmetric inflation goal.
 They judged that a gradual approach to raising the target range would sustain the economic expansion and balance the risks to  the outlook for  inflation and unemployment.
 The Committee also directs the Desk to en gage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve ’s agency mortgage -backed securities transactions.”  The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00  p.m.: “Informa tion received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in December indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising at a solid rate.

" Market -based measures of inflation compensation have increased in recent months but remain low; survey -based measures of longer -term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance."
" Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
" The Committee  expects that, with further gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions will remain strong."
 Inflation on a 12‑month basis is expected to move up this year and to stabilize around the Committee ’s 2 percent objective over the medium term.
" Near -term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced, but the Committee is monitoring inflation developments closely."
" In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1¼ to 1½  percent ."
" The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, Minutes of the Meeting of January 30–31, 2018_                                                                                                                                                                              Page 17thereby supporting strong labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent  inflation."

 The Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to its symmetric inflation goal.
" Consistent with the Committee ’s decision to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the Board of Governors voted unanimously to leave the interest rates on required and excess reserve balances unchanged at 1½  percent  and voted unanimously to approve establishment of the primary c redit rate (discount rate) at the existing level of 2  percent .5   It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday –Wednesday, March  20–21, 2018."
