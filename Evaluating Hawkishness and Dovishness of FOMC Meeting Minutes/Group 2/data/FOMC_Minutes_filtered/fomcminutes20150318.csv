"In their discussion of the options and strategies surrounding the use of tools at liftoff and the potential subsequent reduction in aggregate ON RRP capacity, participants emphasized that during the early stages of policy normalization, it will be a priority to ensure appropriate control over the federal funds rate and other shortterm interest rates."
" A majority of participants thought term reserve draining tools could be useful in reducing ON RRP usage, although a couple of participants questioned their effectiveness in placing upward pressure on market interest rates, and a few did not see term RRPs as reducing the Federal Reserve’s presence in money markets, arguing that investors view term and overnight RRPs as close substitutes."
" However, a number of participants noted that it could be difficult to communicate the reason for such sales to the public, and, in particular, that the announcement of such sa les would risk an outsized market reaction, as the public could view the sales as a signal of a tighter overall stance of monetary policy than they had anticipated or as an indication that the Committee might be more willing than had been thought to sell longerterm assets."
" However, a number of participants emphasized that maintaining control of shortterm interest rates would be paramount in the initial stages of policy normalization, and that it was difficult to know in advance when a reduction would be appropriate."
"At the conclusion of their discussion, all participants agreed to augment the Committee’s Policy Normalization Principles and Plans by providing the following additional details regarding the operational approach the FOMC intends to use when it becomes appropriate to begin normalizing the stance of monetary policy.3 When economic conditions warrant the commencement of policy firming, the Federal Reserve intends to:  Continue to target a range for the federal funds rate that is 25 basis points wide."
Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information reviewed for the March 17 ‒18 meeting suggested that real gro ss domestic product (GDP) growth moderated in the first quarter and that labor market conditions improved further.
 Consumer price inflation was restrained significantly by declines in energy prices and continued to run below the FOMC’s longerrun objective of 2 percent.
" Marketbased measures of inflation compensation were still low, while survey measures of longerrun inflation expectations remained stable."
Nonfarm payroll employment continued to expand strongly in January and February.
 The unemployment rate declined to 5.5 percent in February.
" Both the labor force participation rate and the employmentto-         population ratio rose slightly over the first two months of the year, and the share of workers employed part time for economic reasons edged down."
The U.S. international trade deficit widened substantially in December before narrowi ng somewhat in January.
" Measures of expected longrun inflation from a variety of surveys, including the Michigan survey, the Blue Chip Economic Indicators,  the Survey of Professional Forecasters, and the Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers, remained stable."
 Marketbased measures of inflation compensation were still low.
 Both compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector and the employment cost index rose 2¼ percent over the year ending in the fourth quarter.
" While GDP growth stepped down in several economies, in cluding Canada and China, it picked up in the euro area, Japan, and Mexico."
" Many central banks took steps to ease  monetary policy during the period, including the European Central Bank (ECB), which began purchasing sovereign bonds under its public sector purchase program (PSPP), and the People’s Bank of China, which lowered required reserve ratios for banks."
 A number of other central banks in advanced and emerging market economie s cut policy interest rates.
" Two strong U.S. employment reports and the January consumer price index release, all of which were above market expectations; the start of sovereign bond purchases by the ECB; and the somewhat more encouraging economic news from Europe all appeared to contribute to the improved sentiment in financial markets."
 Market commentary also highlighted Chair Yellen’s statement at the Monetary Policy Report  testimony that the eventual removal of the language in the policy statement noting that “the Committee judges that it can be patient in beginning to normalize the stance of monetary policy” should not be viewed as indicating that the federal funds rate would necessarily be increased with in a couple of meetings.
" However, the effects of these communications on the expected path for the federal funds rate were more than offset by reactions to strongerthan-expected data for the labor market and consumer inflation, along with perceptions of receding downside risks to the foreign economic outlook."
" Measures of inflation compensation based on Treasury InflationProtected Securities increased early in the intermeeting period amid rising oil prices but ended the period little changed, on net, after oil prices dropped back."
" Growth of CRE loans on banks’ books remained solid, in part supported by loans to finance construction activity."
" In addition, demand for funding of CMBS by hedge funds and real estate investment trusts reportedly rose over the same period."
"The dollar appreciated agai nst most other currencies over the intermeeting period, as policymakers in the euro area, Sweden, Denmark, and many emerging market economies eased monetary policy even as market participants anticipated monetary policy tightening in the United States."
"Staff Economic Outlook In the U.S. economic forecast prepared by the staff for the March FOMC meeting, projected real GDP growth in the first half of this year was lower than in the forecast prepared for the January meeting, largely reflecting downward revisions to the nearterm forecasts for household spending, net exports, and residential investment."
" The staff’s mediumterm forecast for real GDP growth also was revised down, mostly because of the effects of a higher projected path for the foreign exchange value of the dollar."
" Nonetheless, the staff continued to forecast that real GDP would expand at a faster pace than potential output in 2015 and 2016, supported by increases in consumer an d business confidence and a small pickup in foreign economic growth, even as the normalization of monetary policy was assumed to begin."
" In 2017, real GDP growth was projected to slow toward, but to remain above, the rate of potential output growth."
 The expansion in economic activity over the medium term was anticipated to gradually reduce resource slack; the unemployment rate was expected to decline slowly and to temporarily move a little below the staff’s estimate of its longerrun natural rate.
" In its mediumterm and longerrun projections, th e staff slightly lowered its assumptions for potential GDP growth and real equilibrium interest rates."
"The staff’s forecast for inflation in the near term was little changed, with the large declines in energy prices since last June still anticipated to lead to a temp orary decrease                                                  4 The president of the Federa l Reserve Bank of Dallas did not participate in this FOMC meeting, and the incoming president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia is scheduled to assume office on July 1."
" The staff’s forecast for inflation in 2016 and 2017 was unchanged, as energy prices and nonoil import prices were still expected to bottom out and begin rising later this year; inflation was projected to move closer to, but remain below, the Committee’s longerrun objective of 2 percent over those years."
" Inflation was anticipated to move back to 2 percent thereafter, with inflation expectations in the longer run assumed to be consistent with the Committee’s objective and slack in labor and product markets projected to have waned."
"The staff viewed the extent of uncertainty around its March projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as similar to the average over the past 20 years."
" The risks to  the forecasts for real GDP growth and inflation were viewed as tilted a little to the downside, reflecting the staf f’s assessment that neither monetary policy nor fiscal policy was well positioned to help the economy withstand adverse shocks."
" At the same time, the staff viewed the risks around its outlook for the unemployment rate as roughly balanced."
"Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, members of the Board of Governors and participating Federal Reserve Bank presidents submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, inflation, and the federal funds rate for each year from 2015 through 2017 and over the longer run, conditional on each participant’s judgment of appropriate monetary policy.4  The longerrun projections represent each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy."
"In their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants regarded the information received over the intermeeting period as indicating that the pace of economic activity had moderated somewhat."
" Labor market conditions continued to improve, with strong job gains and a lower unemployment rate, and and Blake Prichard, First Vice Presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks of Dallas and Philade lphia, respectively, submitted economic projections."
 A number of participants noted that slow growth of productivity or the labor force could reconcile the moderation in economic growth with the solid performance of some labor market indicators.
" Participants exp ected that, over the medium term, real economic activity would expand at a moderate pace and there would be additional improvements in labor market conditions."
" Part icipants generally regarded the net effect of declines in energy prices as likely to be positive for economic activity and employment in the United States, although a couple noted that physical limits on the accumulation of stocks of crude oil could result in further downward pressure on prices and reduce U.S. oil and gas production and investment."
" Inflation had declined further below the Committee’s longerrun objective, largely reflecting declines in energy prices, and was expected to stay near its recent low level in the near term."
" Marketbased measures of inflation compensation 5 to 10 years ahead remained low, while surveybased measures of longerterm inflation expectations had remained stable."
 Participants generally anticipated that inflation would rise gradually toward the Committee’s        2 percent objective as the labor market improved further and the transitory effects of energy price declines and other factors dissipated.
" While almost all participants noted potential risks to the economic outlook resulting from foreign economic and financial developments, most saw the risks to the outlook for economic growth and the labor market as nearly balanced."
" Some participants expressed the view that growth in consumer spending over the medium term would be supported by the strong labor market and rising income, increases in wealth and improvements in household balance sheets, lower gasoline prices, and gains in consumer confidence."
" However, there were widespread reports of a slowdown in growth during the first quarter across a range of industries, partly reflecting severe winter weather in some regions as well as labor disputes at West Coast ports that temporarily disrupted some supply chains."
"In their discussion of the foreign economic outlook, several participants noted that the dollar’s further appreciation over the intermeeting period was likely to restrain U.S. net exports and economic growth for a time."
" A few participants suggested that accommodative policy actions by a number of foreign central banks could lead to a further appreciation of the dollar, but another noted that such actions had also strengthened the outlook for growth abroad, which would bolster U.S. exports."
" Participants pointed to a number of risks to the international economic outlook, including the slowdown in growth in China, fiscal and financial problems in Greece, and geopolitical tensions."
"Participants saw broadbased improvement in labor market conditions over the intermeeting period, including strong gains in payroll employment and a further reduction in the unemployment rate."
" Several participants judged, based on the improvement in a variety of labor market indicators, that the economy was making further progress toward the Committee’s goal of maximum employment."
" Nonetheless, many judged that some degree of labor market slack remained, as evidenced by the low rate of labor force participation, stillelevated involuntary parttime employment, or subdued growth in wages."
 A few of them noted that continued modest wage growth could prompt them to reduce their estimates of the longerrun normal rate of unemployment.
 A few participants observed that the absence of a notable pickup in wages might not be a useful yardstick for evaluating the degree of remaining slack because of the long lags between declines in unemployment and the response of wages or uncertainty about trend productivity growth.
" One participant, however, saw some evidence of rising wage growth and suggested that compositional changes in the labor force co uld be masking underlying wage pressures, particularly as measured by average hourly earnings."
"Page 8Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________Many participants judged that the inflation data received over the intermeeting period had been about in line with their expectations that inflation would move temporarily further below the Committee’s goal, largely reflecting declines in energy prices and lower prices of nonoil imports."
 They continued to expect that inflation would move up toward the Committee’s 2 percent objective over the medium term as the effects of these transitory factors waned and conditions  in the labor market improved further.
" Surveybased measures of inflation expectations had remained stable, and marketbased measures of inflation compensation over the longer term were about unchanged from the time of the January meeting, although they had exhibited some volatility over the intermeeting period."
" Pa rticipants offered various explanations for this correlat ion, including that marketbased measures of inflation compensation were responding to the same global developments as oil prices, that these measures were capt uring changes in risk or liquidity premiums, or that inflationindexed securities were subject to mispricing."
" A couple of participants pointed out that the movements in crude oil prices and marketbased inflation compensation measures had not been particularly well aligned over a longer historical period, or that information gleaned from inflation derivatives suggested a substantial increase in the probability that inflation would remain well below the Committee’s target over the next decade."
" One of them judged that the low level of inflation co mpensation could reflect increased concern on the part of investors about adverse outcomes in which low infl ation was accompanied by weak economic activity, and that it was important not to dismiss this possible interpretation."
"In their discussion of communications regarding the path of the federal funds rate over the medium term, almost all participan ts favored removing from the forward guidance in the Committee’s postmeeting statement the indication that the Committee would be patient in beginning to normalize the stance of monetary policy."
" It was noted that eliminating the reference to being patient would be appropriate in light of the considerable progress achieved toward the Committee’s objective of maximum employment, and that such a change would not indicate that the Committee had decided on the timing of the initial increase in the target range for the federal funds rate."
" Participants generally judged that the appropriate timing of liftoff would depend on their assessment of improvement in the labor market and their degree of confidence that inflation would move back to the Committee’s 2 percent objective over the medium term, and that it would be helpful to convey to the public this datadependent approach to monetary policy."
" One participant did not favor the change to the forward guidance because, with inflation well below the Committee’s 2 percent longerrun target, the announcement of a meetingby-meeting approach to policy could lead to a tightening of financial conditions that would slow progress toward the Committee’s objectives."
Participants expressed a range of views about how they would assess the outlook for inflation and when they might deem it appropriate to begin removing policy accommodation.
" It was noted that there were no simple criteria for such a judgment, and, in particular, that, in a context of progress toward maximum employment and reasonable confidence that inflation will move back to 2 percent over the medium term, the normalization process could be initiated prior to seeing increases in core price inflation or wage inflation."
" Further improvement in the labor market, a stabilization of energy prices, and a leveling out of the foreign exchange value of the dollar were all seen as helpful in establishing confidence that inflation would turn up."
" However, others anticipated that the effects of energy price declines and the dollar’s appr eciation would continue to weigh on inflation in the near term, suggesting that conditions likely would not be appropriate to begin raising rates until later in the year, and a couple of participants suggested that the economic outlook likely would not call for liftoff until 2016."
"Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that information received since the FOMC met in January indicated that economic growth had moderated somewh at."
" Labor market conditions had improved further, with strong job gains and a lower unemployment rate; a variety of labor market indicators suggested that the underutilization of labor resources continued to dimini sh."
" Business fixed investment was advancing, although the recovery in the housing sector remained slow and export growth had weakened."
" Inflation had declined further below the Committee’s longerrun objective, largely reflecting the declines in energy prices."
 Marketbased measures of inflation compensation remained low; surveybased measures of longerterm inflation expectations had been stable.
" The Committee expected that, with appropriate monetary policy accommodation, economic activity would expand at a moderate pace and labor market indicators would continue to mo ve toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate."
 The Committee also expected that inflation would remain near its recent low level in the near term but rise gradually toward 2 percent over the medium term as the labor market improves further and the transitory effects of energy price declines and other factors dissipate.
" In light of the uncertainties attending the outlook for inflation, the Committee agreed that it should continue to monitor inflation developments closely."
"In their discussion of language for the postmeeting statement, the Committee agreed that the data received over the intermeeting period suggested that economic growth had moderated somewhat."
" One factor behind that moderation was a slowdown in the growth of exports, and members decided that the statement should explicitly note that factor."
" In addition, data received over the intermeeting period indicated th at inflation had declined, as the Committee had anticipated, and members agreed to update the statement to reflect their judgment that inflation was likely to remain near its recent low level in the near term."
 Members also judged that it was appropriate to note that marketbased measures of inflation compensation remained near levels registered at the time of the January FOMC meeting.
The Committee agreed to main tain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and to reaffirm in the statement that the Committee’s decision about how long to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate would depend on its assessment of actual and expected progress toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.
" Members continued to judge that this assessment of progress would take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
" In light of the considerable progress to date toward the Committee’s maximumemplo yment objective and the implications of that progress for the outlook for inflation, members agreed to remove from the forward guidance in the postmeeting statement the indication that the Committee judges that it can be patient in beginning to normalize the stance of monetary policy and to indicate instead that the Committee anticipates that it will be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate when it has seen further improvement in the labor market and is reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term."
" The Committee agreed to reiterate its expectation that, even after employment and inflation are near mandateconsistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run."
"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct  the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: “Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster maximum employment and price stability."
 The System Open Market Account manager and the secretary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the System’s balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the Committee’s objectives of maximum employment and price stability.”   The vote encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p.m.: “Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in  January suggests that economic growth has moderated somewhat.
" Labor market conditions have improved further, with strong job gains and a lower unemployment rate."
" Business fixed inve stment is advancing, while the recovery in the housing sector remains slow and export growth has weakened."
" Inflation has declined further below the Committee’s longerrun objective, largely reflecting declines in energy prices."
 Marketbased measures of inflation compensation remain low; surveybased measures of longerterm inflation expectations have remained stable.
"Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
" The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, with labor market indicators continuing to move toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate."
 The Committee continues to see the risks to the outlook for economic activity and the labor market as nearly balanced.
" Inflation is anticipated to remain near its recent low level in the near term, but the Committee expects inflation to rise gradually toward 2 percent over the medium term as the labor market improves further and the transitory effects of energy price declines and other factors dissipate."
 The Committee continues to monitor inflation developments closely.
"To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee today reaffirmed its view that the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate remains appropriate."
" In determining how long to maintain this target range, the Committee will assess progress— both realized and expected—toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation."
" This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
" The Committee anticipates that it will be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate when it has seen further improvement in the labor market and is reasonably confident that inflation will move Minutes of the Meeting of March 17–18, 2015Page 11_____________________________________________________________________________________________back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term."
"When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longerrun goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent."
" The Committee currently anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near mandateconsistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the      Committee views as normal in the longer run.” Voting for this action: Janet L."
"   _____________________________ Thomas Laubach Secretary  Page 12Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________   Summary of Economic Projections  In conjunction with the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting held on March 17–18, 2015, meeting participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real output growth, the unemployment rate, inflation, and the federal funds rate for each year from 2015 to 2017 and over the longer run.1  Each participant’s projection was based on information available at the time of the meeting plus his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy and assumptions about the factors likely to affect  economic outcomes."
" The longerrun projections repres ent each participant’s assessment of the value to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy."
 “Appropriate monetary policy” is defined as the future path of policy that each participant deems most likely to foster outcomes for economic activity and inflation that best satisfy his or her individual interpretation of the Federal Reserve’s objectives of maximum employment and stable prices.
  All FOMC participants but one expected that economic growth under appropriate policy would be somewhat faster in 2015 and in 2016 than their individual estimates of the U.S. economy’s longerrun normal growth rate and at or near its longerrun rate in 2017 (table 1 and figure 1).
" Most participants projected that the unemployment rate would contin ue to decline in 2015 and 2016, and all participants projected that the unemployment rate would be at or below their individual judgments of its longerrun normal level by the end of 2017."
" Participants saw inflation, as measured by the fourquarter change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), slowing this year but picking up notably next year; almost all of the participants projected that inflation would be at or close to the Committee’s 2 percent longerrun objective in 2017."
 Most expected that it would be appropriate to raise the target federal funds rate fairly gradually over the projection period as labor market conditions and inflation move toward values the Committee judges consistent with the attainment of its mandated objectives of maximum employment and stable prices.
" Most participants continued to expect that it would be appropriate for the federal funds rate to stay appreciably below its longerrun level after inflation and unemployment are near mandateconsistent levels,  Table 1."

Most participants viewed the uncertainty associated with their outlooks for economic growth and the unemployment rate as broadly similar to the average level of the past 20 years.
" Most participants also judged the level of uncertainty about inflation to be broadly similar to the average level of the past 20 years, although several participants viewed it as higher."
" In addition, most participants continued to see the ri sks to the outlook for economic growth and for the unemployment rate as broadly balanced, though some viewed the risks to economic growth as weighted to the downside."
" Equal numbers of participants saw the risks to inflation as balanced or as weighted to the downside, while one judged these risks as tilted to the upside."
"The Outlook for Economic Activity Participants generally projected that, conditional on their individual assumptions about appropriate monetary policy, real gross domestic product (GDP) would grow in 2015 and 2016 at a pace somewhat faster than their estimates of its longerrun normal rate and at or near its longerrun rate in 2017."
" Pa rticipants pointed to a number of factors that they expected would contribute to solid real output growth over the next few years, including improving labor market conditions, strengthened household and business balance sheets, the boost to consumer spending from low energy prices, diminishing restraint from fiscal poli cy, and stillaccommodative monetary policy."
"Compared with their Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) contributions in December, all but a couple of participants revised down their projections of real GDP growth over the forecast period."
" The central tendencies of participants’ current projections for real GDP growth were  2.3 to 2.7 percent in 2015 and in 2016, and 2.0 to             2.4 percent in 2017."
" The central tendency of the projections of real GDP growth over the longer run was 2.0 to 2.3 percent, unchanged from December."
"Most participants projected that the unemployment rate would continue to decline through 2016, and all projected that by the fourth quarter of 2017 the unemployment rate would be at or below their individual judgments of its longerrun normal level."
" The central tendencies of participants’ forecasts for the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of each year were 5.0 to 5.2 percent in 2015, 4.9 to 5.1 percent in 2016, and         4.8 to 5.1 percent in 2017."
" Compared with the December SEP, participants’ projected paths for the unemployment rate generally shifted down slightly through 2017."
 Many participants noted that recent data pointing to fasterthan-expected improvement in labor market conditions were an important factor underlying the downward revisions to their unemployment rate forecasts.
" More than half of the participants revised down their estimates of the longerrun normal rate of unemployment; as a result, the central tendency of these estimates shifted down to 5.0 to 5.2 percent."
" Several participants noted that stillsubdued wage and price inflation despite the strongerthan-expected momentum in the labor market suggested a lower level of the longerrun normal unemployment rate than they had thought previously, and a couple mentioned research indicating that demographic groups with lower average unemployment rates have   accounted for an increasing fraction of the labor force."
Figures 3.A and 3.B show the distribution of participants’ views regarding the likely outcomes for real GDP growth and the unemployment  rate through 2017.
" Some of the diversity of views reflected participants’ individual assessments of the effects of lower oil prices on consumer spending and business investment, of the extent to which dollar appreciation would affect real activity, of the rate at which the forces that have been restraining the pace of the economic recovery would continue to abate, of the trajectory for growth in consumption as    labor market slack diminishes, and of the appropriate path of monetary policy."
" Relative to the December SEP, the dispersion of participants’ projections for real GDP growth was a bit narrowe r from 2015 through 2017, while for the unemployment rate, the dispersion was roughly unchanged."
"The Outlook for Inflation  Compared with the December SEP, all participants marked down their projections for PCE inflation this year, noting that inflation had been running below their earlier projections and that sign ificant declines in energy prices and import prices were putting temporary downward pressure on inflation."
" All participants saw PCE inflation picking up in 2016, and almost all saw inflation at or close to the Committee’s 2 percent longerrun objective in 2017."
" All of the participants also marked down their projections for core PCE inflation this year, and nearly half revised down their projections for core PCE inflation in 2016 by 0.2 percentage point or more, with many noting that core inflation had run below their earlier projections in recent months and several citing declines in nonoil import prices and passthrough of dePage 4Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________Figure 3.A.

 Almost all expected core inflation to rise gradually over the projection period and to reach a level at or near 2 percent in 2017.
" The central tendencies for PCE inflation were 0.6 to 0.8 percent in 2015, 1.7 to 1.9 percent in 2016, and 1.9 to 2.0 percent in 2017, and the central tend encies for core PCE inflation were 1.3 to 1.4 percen t in 2015, 1.5 to 1.9 percent in 2016, and 1.8 to 2.0 percen t in 2017."
" Factors cited by participants as likely to contribute to a rise of inflation toward 2 percent included stable longerterm inflation expectations, steadily diminishing resource slack, a pickup in wage growth, the waning effects of declines in energy prices, and stillacco mmodative monetary policy."
Figures 3.C and 3.D provide information on the distribution of participants’ views about the outlook for inflation.
 The range of participants’ projections for PCE inflation in 2015 narrowed somewhat compared with December.
" The range for PCE inflation in 2016 widened slightly, likely reflecting in part differences in participants’ assessments of the effe cts of the declines in energy and import prices on the outlook for inflation."
" Similarly, the ranges for core PCE inflation narrowed in 2015 and widened slightly in 2016."
Appropriate Monetary Policy Participants judged that it would be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate over the projection period as labor market conditions and inflation move toward values the Committee judges consistent with the attainment of its mandated objectives of maximum employment and price stability.
Most participants projected that the unemployment rate would be at or somewhat above their estimates of its longerrun normal level at the end of the year in which they judged the initial increase in the target range for the federal funds rate would be warranted.
" Almost all participants projected that inflation would be below the Committee’s 2 percent objective that year, but they also saw inflation rising substantially closer to 2 percent in the following year."
 Participants provided a number of reasons why they thought it would be appropriate for the federal funds rate to remain below its longerrun normal level for some time after inflation and the unemployment rate were near mandateconsistent levels.
" These reasons included an assessment that the headwinds that have been holding back the recovery will continue to exert some restraint on economic activity at that time, that weak real activity abroad and the recent appreciation of the dollar are likely to continue to restrain U.S. net exports for some time, that residual slack in the labor market will still be evident in measures of labor utilization other than the unemployment rate, and that the risks to the economic outlook are asymmetric as a result of the constraints on monetary policy a ssociated with the effective lower bound on the federal funds rate."
"Relative to the December SEP, almost half of the participants revised down their estimates of the longerrun level of the federal funds rate, typically by ¼ percentage point, with a lower assessment of the economy’s longerrun potential growth rate generally cited as a contributing factor for those revision s."
" All participants judged that inflation in the longer run would be equal to the Committee’s inflation objective of 2 percent, implying that their individual judgments regarding the appropriate longerrun level of the real federal funds rate in the absence of further shocks to the economy ranged from 1.0 to 2.25 percent."

" At the end of this summary, the box “Forecast Uncertainty” the prescriptions of various monetary policy rules as factors they considered in judging the appropriate path for the federal funds rate."
"Uncertainty and Risks Nearly all participants continued to judge the levels of uncertainty attending their projections for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate as broadly similar to the norms during the previous 20 years (figure 4).2  Most participants continued to see the risks to their outlooks for real GDP growth as broadly balanced, though some participants viewed the risks to real GDP growth as weighted to the downside."
" Those participants who viewed the risks as weighted to the downside cited, for example, concern about the limited ability of monetary policy at the effective lower bound to respond to further negative shocks to the economy or about the trajectory for economic growth abroad."
 Nearly all participants again judged the risks to the outlook for the unemployment rate to be broadly balanced.
"As in the December SEP, participants generally agreed that the levels of uncertainty associated with their inflation forecasts were broadly similar to historical norms."
 Almost half of participants viewed the risks to their inflation forecast as balanced.
" These participants cited the possibility that the recent low levels of inflation could prove more persistent than anticipated or that the upward pressure on prices from inflation expectations might be weaker than assumed, or the judgment that, in current circumstances, it would be difficult for the Committee to respond effectively to lowinflation outcomes."
" Conversely, one participant saw upside risks to inflation, citing uncertainty about the timing and efficacy of the Committee’s withdrawal of monetary policy accommodation."
±1.6 ±2.1 ±2.0 Unemployment rate1 .
" As described in the box “Forecast Uncertainty,” under certain assumptions, there is about a 70 pe rcent probability that actual outcomes for real GDP, unemployment, an d consumer prices  will be in ranges implied by the average size of projection errors made in the past."

" Thus, in setting the stance of monetary policy, participants consider no t only what appears to be the most likely economic outcome as embodied in their projections, but also the range of alternative possibilities, the likelihood of their occurring, and the potential costs to the economy should they occur."
"Table 2 summarizes the average historical accuracy of a range of forecasts, including those reported in past Monetary Policy Report s and those prepared by the Federal Reserve Board’s staff in advance of meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee."
 The corresponding 70 percent confidence intervals for overall inflation would be 1.1 to 2.9 percent in the current year and 1.0 to 3.0 percent in the second and third years.
"As with real activity and inflation, the outlook for the future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable uncertainty."
 This uncertainty arises primarily because each participant’s assessment of the appropriate stance of monetary policy depends importantly on the evolution of real activity and inflation over time.
