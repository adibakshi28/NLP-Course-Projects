"Williams, Senior Information Manager, Division of Monetary Affairs, Board of Governors                                                              3 Attended through the discussion of the long -run monetary policy implementation frameworks."
"Hornstein, Senior Advisor, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond   Samuel Schulhofer -Wohl, Senior Economist  and Research Advisor, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago   Gara Afonso,3 Research Officer, Federal Reserve Bank of New York   Long -Run Monetary Policy Implementation Frameworks  Committee participants resumed their discussion of potential long -run frameworks for monetary policy implementation, a topic last discussed at the November 2016 FOMC meeting."
" The staff provided briefings that described changes in recent years in banks’ uses of reserves, outlined tradeoffs associated with potential choices of operating regimes to implement monetary policy and control shortterm interest rates, reviewed potential choices of the policy target rate, and summarized developments in the policy implementation frameworks of other ce ntral banks."
" Information from bank contacts as well as a survey of banks indicated that, in an environment in which money market interest rates were very close to the interest rate paid on excess reserve balances, banks would likely be comfortable operating with much lower levels of reserve balances than at present but would wish to maintain substantially higher levels of balances than before the crisis."
" On average, survey responses suggested that banks might reduce their rese rve holdings only modestly from those “lowest comfortable” levels if money market interest rates were somewhat above the interest on excess reserves  (IOER)  rate."
  The staff highlighted how changes in the determinants of reserve demand since the crisis could affect the tradeoffs between two types of operating regimes : (1) one in which aggregate excess reserves are sufficiently limited that money market interest rates are  sensitive to small changes in the supply of reserves and (2) one in which aggregate excess reserves are sufficiently abundant that money market interest rates are not sensitive to small changes in reserve supply.
" This technique worked well before the financia l crisis, when reserve demand was fairly stable in the aggregate and largely influenced by payment needs and reserve requirements."
"  However, with the increased use of reserves for precautionary liquidity purposes  following the crisis, there was some uncert ainty about whether banks’ demand for reserves would now be sufficiently predictable for the Federal Reserve to be able to precisely target an interest rate in this way."
" In the latter type of regime, money market interest rates are not sensitive to small fluctuations in the demand for and supply of reserves, and the stance of monetary policy is instead transmitted from the Federal Reserve’s administered rates to market rates —an approach that has been effective in controlling short -term interest rates in th e United States since the financial crisis, as well as in other countries where central banks have used this approach."
" These rates could also be targeted with abundant excess reserves, as could interest rates on secured funding or a mixture of secured and unsecured rates."
" Participants commented that, by contrast, interest rate control might be difficult to achieve in an operating regime of limited excess reserves in view of the potential ly greater  unpredictability of reserve demand resulting from liquidity regulations or  changes in risk appetite , or the increased variability of factors affecting reserve supply."
 Monetary policy operations in this regime would also not require  active m anagement of reserve supply.
  They expected to learn more about the demand  for reserves as the balance sheet continued to shrink in a gradual and predictable manner .
 They  also observed that it might be  possible to adopt strategies that provide incentives for banks to reduce their demand for reserves.
" Participants cited several potential b enefits of  targeting the OBFR rather than the EFFR :  The larger volume of transactions and greater variety of lenders underlying the OBFR could make that rate a broader and more robust indicator of banks’ overnight funding costs , the OBFR c ould become an even better indicator after the potential incorporation of data on onshore wholesale deposits, and  the similarity of the OBFR and the EFFR suggested that transitioning to the OBFR would not require significant changes in the way the Committee conducted and  communicated monetary policy."
 Some participants saw it as desirable to explore the possibilit y of targeting a secured interest rate.
 They emphasized that it would be important to communicate clearly the rationale for any choice of operating regime and target interest rate.
 Market contacts also noted some nervousness about corporate earnings growth and an increase in longer -term Treasury yields over recent weeks as factors contributing to downward pressure on equity prices.
" On balance, the turbulence in equity markets did not leave much imprint on near -term U.S. monetary policy expectations."
" Consumer price inflation, as measured by the 12 -month percent age change in the price index for  personal consumption expenditures (PCE), was 2.0  percent  in September."
 Survey-based measures of longer -run inflation expectations were little changed on balance.
" Total nonfarm payroll employment increased at a strong pace, on average, in September and October."
" The national unemployment rate decreased to 3.7  percent  in September and remained at that level in October, while the labor force participation rate and the employment -topopulation ratio moved up somewhat over those two months."
" The unemployment r ates for African Americans, Asians, and Hispanics in October were below their levels at the end of the previous expansion."
The rates of private -sector job openings and quits both remained at high levels in September; initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits in late  October were close to historically low levels.
" Total labor compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector increased 2.8 percent  over the four quarters ending in the third quarter, the employment cost index for private workers increased 2.9  percent  over the 12 months ending in September, and average hourly earnings for all employees rose 3.1 percent  over the 12  months ending in October."
"_____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of November 7–8, 2018Page 5Key factors that influence consumer spending —including solid gains  in real disposable personal income and the effects of earlier increases in equity prices and home values on households’ net worth—continued to be supportive of solid real PCE growth in the near term."
" Real residential investment declined further in the third quarter, likely reflecting  a range of factors including  the continued effects of rising mortgage interest rates on the affordability of hous ing."
  Growth in real private expenditures for business equipment and intellectual property moderated in the third quarter following strong gains in these expenditures in the first half of the year.
 The nominal U.S. international trade deficit widened in August and September.
 The change in net exports was estimated to have been a sizable drag on real GDP growth in the third qua rter.
" Core PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in consumer food and energy prices, also was 2.0  percent  over that same period."
" The consumer price index (CPI) rose 2.3  percent  over the 12 months ending in September, while core CPI inflation was 2.2 percent ."
" Recent readings on survey -based measures of longer -run inflation expectations —including those from the Michigan survey , the Blue Chip Economic Indicators, and the Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants —were little changed on balance."
" Foreign economic growth appeared to pick up in the third quarter, as a strong rebound in economic activity in se veral emerging market economies (EMEs) more than offset a slowdown in China and most advanced foreign economies (AFEs)."
" In contrast, GDP growth slowed in China and the euro area, and indicators pointed to a step -down in Japanese growth."
" Foreign inflation picked up in the third quarter, boosted by higher oil prices and, in China, by higher food prices."
" However, underlying inflation pressures remained muted, especially in some AFEs.  Staff Review of the Financial Situation  Concerns about ongoing international trade tensions, the global growth outlook, and rising interest rates weighed on global equity market sentiment over the intermeeting period."
 Financing conditions for nonfinancial businesses and households remained supportive of economic activity on balance.
 Various factors appeared to weigh on investor sentiment including n ews related to ongoing international trade tensions and investors’ concerns  about the sustainability of strong corporate earnings growth .
 FOMC communications over the intermeeting period were viewed by market participants as consistent with a continued gradual removal of monetary policy accommodation.
 Marketimplied measures of monetary policy expectation s were generally little changed.
" Meanwhile, measures of inflation compensation derived from Treasury Inflation -Protected Securities decli ned somewhat, with some of the decline occurring following the weaker -thanex-pected September CPI release."
 Overnight interest rates in short -term funding markets rose in line with the increase in the target range for the federal funds rate announced at th e September FOMC meeting.
" Over the intermeeting period, global investors focused on changes in U.S. equity prices and interest rates, ongoing trade tensions between the United States and China, and uncertainty regarding budget negotiations between the Italian government and the European Union."
" Bond yields in Germany and the United Kingdom fell, partly reflecting weaker -thanexpected inflation data and European political develop ments."
" Interest rate spreads on commercial mortgage -backed securities (CMBS) remained near their postcrisis lows, while issuance of non -agency and agency CMBS was stable in recent months and similar to yearearlier  levels."
" Most borrowers in the residential mortgage market continued to experience accommodative financing conditions, although the increase in mortgage rate s since 2016  appeared to have reduced housing demand, and financing conditions remained somewhat tight for borrowers with low credit scores."
" Growth in home -purchase mortgage originations slowed over the past year as mortgage rates stayed  near their highest level since 2011, and refinancing activity continued to be very muted."
" Financing conditions in consumer credit markets, on balance, remained supportive of growth in household spending, although interest rates for consumer loans continued to rise."
 Credit card loan growth showed signs of moderating amid rising interest rates and reported tightening of lending standards at the largest credit card banks.
" Relative to the forecast prepared for the previous meeting, the projection for real GDP growth this year was little revised."
" Over the 2018 –20 period, output was forecast to rise at a rate above or at the staff’s estimate of potential growth and then slow to a pace below it in 2021."
 The unemployment rate was projected to decline  further below the staff’s estimate of its longer -run natural rate but to bottom out in 2020 and begin to edge up in 2021.
" The medium -term projection for real GDP growth was only a bit weaker than in the previous forecast, primarily reflecting a lower pro jected path for equity prices, leaving the unemployment rate forecast little revised."
" With labor market conditions already tight, the staff continued to assume that projected employment gains would manifest in smaller -thanusual downward pressure on the u nemployment rate and in larger -thanusual upward pressure on the labor force participation rate."
 The staff expected both total and core PCE price inflation to remain close to 2  percent  through the medium term.
 The staff’s forecasts for both total and core  PCE price inflation were little revised on net.
" The staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as similar to the average of the past 20 years."
 The staff also saw the risks to the forecast s for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate as balanced.
" On the downside, trade policies and foreign economic developments could move in directions that have significant negative effects on U.S. economic growth."
 Risks to the inflation projection also were seen as balanced.
 The upside risk that inflation could increase more than expected in an economy that was projected to move further above its potential was counterbalanced by the downside risk that longer -term inflation expectations may be lower than was assumed in the staff forecast.
" Participants’ View on Current Conditions and the Economic Out look In their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants agreed that information received since the FOMC met in September indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising  at a strong rate."
" Job gains had been strong, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate had declined."
" Household spending had continued to grow strongly, while growth of business fixed investment had moderated from its rapid pace earlier in the year."
" On a 12 -month basis, both overall inflation and core inflation, which excludes changes in food and energy prices, had remained near 2 percent ."
 Indicators of longer -term inflation expectations were little changed on balance.
" Based on recent read ings on spending, prices, and the labor market, participants generally indicated little change in their assessment of the economic outlook , with above -trend economic growth expected to continue  before slowing to a pace closer to trend  over the medium term ."
" Participants pointed to several factors supporting above -trend growth , including strong employment gains, expansionary  federal tax and spending policies, and continued high levels of consumer and business confidence."
" Several  participants observed that the stimulative  effects of fiscal policy would likely diminish over time, while the lagged effects  of reductions in monetary policy accommodation would show through Page 8Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________more fully, with both factors  contributing to their expectation  that economic growth would slow to  a pace closer to trend."
"  In their discussion of the household sector, participants generally continued to characterize consumption growth as strong."
  Participants observed that growth in business fixed investment slowed in the third quarter following several quarters of rapid growth.
" S ome participants pointed to anecdotal evidence regarding higher tariffs and uncertainty about trade policy, slowing global demand , rising input costs,  or higher interest rates  as possible factors contributing to the slowdown."
 A couple of others  noted that business investment growth  can be volatile on a quarterly basis  and factors such as the recent cuts in corporate taxes and high levels of business sentiment were expected to support investment going forward.
" Reports from District contacts in the manufacturing, energy, and service sectors were generally favorable, though growth in manufacturing activity was reportedly moderating  in a couple of Districts ."
" Business contacts generally remained optimistic about the outlook , but concerns about trade policy, slowing foreign demand, and labor shortages were reportedly weighing on business prospects."
" The unemployment rate remained at a historically low level in October, and the labor force participation rate moved  up."
" Participants observed that, a t the national level, measures of nominal wage growth appeared to be pick ing up."
 Many  participants noted that  the recent pace of aggregate wage gains was broadly consistent  with trends in productivity growth and inflation.
  Participants observed  that both overall and core PCE price  inflation remained near 2  percent  on a 12 -month basis.
" In general, participants viewed recent price developments as consistent with their expectation that inflation would remain near  the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent  objective on a sustained basis."
 Reports from business contacts and surveys in a number of Districts were consistent with some firming in inflationary pressure.
" Participants commented on a number of risks and uncertainties associated with their outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation over the medium term."
" A few participants indicated that uncertai nty had increased  recently , pointing to the high levels of uncertainty  regarding the effect s of fiscal and trade policies on economic activity and inflation."
" Some  participants viewed economic and financial developments abroad, including the possibility of further appreciation of the U.S. dollar, as posing downside risks for domestic economic growth and inflation."
" A couple of participants expressed the concern that  measures of inflation expectations would remain low, particularly if economic growth slowed more than expected."
" Several participants were concerned that the high level of debt in  the nonfinancial business sector , and especially the high level of leverage d loans , made the economy more vulnerable to a sharp pullback in credit availability , which  could exacerbate the effects of a negative shock on economic activity."
 The potential for an escalation in tariffs or trade tensions was also cited as a factor  that could slow economic growth more than expected.
 Some  participa nts raised the concern that tightening resource ut ilization in conjunction with an increase in the ability of firms to pass through increases in tariffs or in other input costs  to consumer prices could generate undesirable upward pressure on inflation.
" In their discussion of monetary policy, participants agreed that it would be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting."
" Participan ts generally judge d that the economy had been evolving about as they had anticipated , with economic activity rising at a strong rate, labor market conditions continuing to strengthen, and inflation running at or near the Committee’s longer -run objective."
 Almost all participants reaffirmed the view that further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate  would  likely be consistent with sustaining the Committee’s objectives of maximum employment and price stability.
" Consistent with their judgment that a gradual approach to policy normalization remained  appropriate, almost all participants expressed the view that another increase in the target range for the federal funds rate was likely to be warranted fairly soon  if incoming information on the labor market and inflation was in line with or stronger than their current expectations ."
 A couple of participants noted that the federal funds rate might currently be near  its neutral level and that further increases in the federal funds rate could unduly slow the expansion of economic activity  and put downward pressure on inflation and inflation expectations .
" Monetary policy was not on a preset course ; if incoming information prompted  meaningful reassessments  of the economic outlook and attendant r isks, either to the upside or the downside , their policy outlook w ould change ."
" Various f actors such as t he recent tightening in financial conditions , risks in the global outlook, and some signs of slowing in interest -sensitive sectors of the economy on the one hand, and further indicators of tightness in labor markets  and possible inflationary pressures, on the other hand,  were noted in this context."
"Committee Policy Action  In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that information received since the Committee met in September indicated that the labor market had  continued to strengthen and that  economic activity had been rising at a strong rate."
" Job gains had been strong, on average, in recent months , and the unemployment rate had declined."
" Household spending had continued to grow strongly, while growth of business fixed investment had moderated recently  from its rapid pace earlier in the year."
" On a 12 -month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy remain ed near 2  percent ."
 Indicators of long -Page 10Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________term inflation expectations were little changed on balance.
" Consequently, membe rs continued to expect that further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would be consistent with sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee’s symmetric 2  percent  objective over the medium term."
"After assessing current conditions and the outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, members decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 2 to 2¼  percent ."
 Members agree d that the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate would depend on their assessment of realized and expected economic conditions relative to the Committee’s  maximum employment and symmetric 2  percent  inflation objective s.
" They reiterated that this assessment would take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and reading s on financial and international developments."
"  More generally,  member s noted that decisions regarding near -term adjustments of the stance of monetary policy would appropriately remain dependent on the evolution of the outlook as informed by incoming data ."
 The Committee also dir ects the Desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve’s agency mortgage -backed securities transactions.”  The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p.m.: “Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in September indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising at a strong rate.
" Job gains have been strong, on average, in r ecent months, and the unemployment rate has declined."
" Household spending has continued to grow strongly, while growth of business fixed investment has moderated from its rapid pace earlier in the year."
" On a 12 -month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy remain near 2  percent ."
" Indicators of longer -term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance."
" Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
"  The Committee expects that further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be consistent with sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of November 7–8, 2018Page 11market conditions, and inflation near the Committee’s symmetric 2  percent  objective over the medium term."
" In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 2  to 2¼ percent ."
"In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2  percent  inflation  objective."
" This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.”  Voting for this action:  Jerome H."
" Consistent with the Committee’s decision to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the Board of Governors voted unanimously to leave the interest rates on required and excess reserve balances unchanged at 2.20 percent  and voted unanimously to approve establishment of the primary credit rate at the existing level of 2.75  percent , effective November  9, 2018."
 Update from Subcommittee on C ommunications  Governor Clarida presented a proposal from the subcommittee on communications to conduct a review during 2019 of the Federal Reserve’s strategic framework for monetary policy.
" This assessment would consider the strategy, tools, and communications that would best enable the Federal Reserve to meet its statutory objectives of maximum employment and price stability."
" W ith labor market conditions cl ose to maximum employment and inflation near  the Committee’s 2  percent  objective, it was an opportune time for the Federal Reserve to undertake this review and assess the robustness of its strategic framework."
