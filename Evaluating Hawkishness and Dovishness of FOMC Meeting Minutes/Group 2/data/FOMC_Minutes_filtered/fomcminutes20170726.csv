" The increase in the FOMC’s target range for the federal funds rate at the June meeting was reflected in other money market interest rates, and the effective federal funds rate was near the middle of the  new target range over the intermeeting period  except on quarter -end."
" Conditions in foreign exchange swap markets were fairly stable, and demand at centr al bank dollar auctions was relatively low."
" The 12 -month change in overall consumer prices, as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), slowed again in May; both total consumer price inflation and core i nflation, which excludes consumer food and energy prices, were running below 2  percent ."
 Data from the consumer  and producer  price index es for June suggested that both total and core PCE price inflation (on a 12month change basis) remained at a pace similar to that seen in the previous month.
 Survey -based measures of longer -run inflation expectations were little changed on balance.
" Total nonfarm payroll employment expanded solidly in June, and the average monthly pace of private -sector job gains over the first half of the year was essentially the same as last year."
 The unemployment rate edged up  to 4.4 percent  in June; the unemployment rates for African Americans and for Hispanics declined slightly but remained above the unemployment rates for Asians and for whites.
 The four -week moving average of initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits remained at a very low level through mid -July.
" However, recent readings on key factors that influence consumer spending — including continued gains in employment, real disposable personal income, and households’ net worth—pointed to solid growth in total real PCE in the near term."
" The nominal U.S. international trade deficit narrowed in May, with an increase in exports and a small decl ine in imports."
" Export growth was led by consumer goods, automotive products, and services."
 The available data suggested that net exports were a slight drag on real GDP growth in t he second quarter.
 Core PCE price inflation was also 1½ percent  over that same period.
" Over the 12 months ending in June, the consumer price index ( CPI) rose 1½ percent , while core CPI inflation was 1¾  percent ."
 The median of inflation expectations over the next 5 to 10 years from the Michigan survey edged up both in June and in the preliminary reading for July.
" Other measures of longer -run inflation expectations  were generally little changed, on balance, in recent months , although those from the Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants had ticked down recently ."
"Incoming data suggested that economic growth continued to firm abroad, especially among advanced foreign economies (AFEs)."
" The pickup in advanced -economy demand also contributed to relatively strong growth in Minutes of the Meeting of July 25–26, 2017Page 3_____________________________________________________________________________________________  China and emerging Asia, but growth in Latin America remained relatively weak , partly reflecting tight monetary and fiscal policies."
" Despite the stronger momentum of economic activity in the AFEs, headline inflation declined sharply in the second quarter, largely reflecting lower retail energy prices, and core inflation stayed subdued in many AFEs.  Al though inflation was also low in most emerging market economies (EMEs), it remained elevated in Mexico because of rising food inflation and earlier peso depreciation."
 Financing conditions for nonfinancial businesses and households generally remained supportive of growth in spending.
 Market participants also took note of the summary in the June minutes of the Committee’s discussion of the progress toward the Committee’s 2  percent  longer -run inflation objective and the extent to which recent softness in price data r eflected idiosyncratic factors.
 Measures of inflation compensation based on Treasury InflationProtected Securities ticked up since the June FOMC meeting.
" Despite their intermeeting period gains, longer -term real and nominal Treasury yields remained very low by historical standards, apparently weighed down by accommodative monetary policies abroad and possibly by declines in the long -term neutral real interest rate over recent years."
" Responses from the July Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS) indicated that depressed demand was largely responsible, and that banks’ lending standards were little changed in recent months."
" The most cited reason for the lackluster loan demand was subdued investment spending by nonfinancial businesses, but banks also reported  that some borrowers had shifted  to other sources of external financing or to internally generate d funds."
"Financing conditions for commercial real estate (CRE) remained accommodative, al though the growth of CRE loans on banks’ books slowed somewhat."
" SLOOS respondents also reported that standards on CRE loans were tight relative to their historical range, and that, on net, demand for CRE loans weakened in recent months."
" However, growth of mortgage loans on banks’ books slowed somewhat in the first half of this Page 4Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________  year."
" Reflecting in part continued tightening of lending  standards, consumer loan growth at banks moderated further in the second quarter; however, that weakness was partially offset by more robust lending by credit unions."
" In particular, real GDP growth, which was modest in the first quarter, was still expected to have stepped up to a solid pace in the second quarter and to maintain roughly the same rate of increase in the second half of the year."
" However, the ef fect of this change on the projection for real GDP over the next couple of years was largely offset by lower assumed paths for the exchange value of the dollar and for longer -term interest rates."
 The unemployment rate was projected to decline gradually over the next couple of years and to continue running below the staff’s estimate of its longer -run natural  rate over this period.
" The staff’s forecast for consumer price inflation, as measured by the change in the PCE price index, was revised down slightly for 2017 in response to weaker -thanexpected incoming data for inflation."
" As a result, inflation this yea r was expected to be similar in magnitude to last year, with an upturn in the prices for food and nonenergy imports offset by a slower increase in core PCE prices and weaker energy prices."
" Beyond 2017, the forecast was little revised from the previous pr ojection, as the recent weakness in inflation was viewed as transitory."
  The staff continued to project that inflation would increase in the next couple of years and that it would be close to the Committee’s longer -run objective in 2018 and at 2  percent  in 2019.
" The staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as similar to the average of the past 20 years."
 The staff saw the risks to the forecasts for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate as balanced.
 The risks to the projection for inflation also were seen as balanced.
" Downside risks included the possibilities that longer -term inflation expectations may have edged down, that the dollar could  appreciate substantially, or that the recent run of soft inflation readings could prove to be more persistent than the staff expected."
" These downside risks were seen as essentially Minutes of the Meeting of July 25–26, 2017Page 5_____________________________________________________________________________________________  counterbalanced by the upside risk that inflation could increase more than expected in an economy that was projected to continue operating above its longer -run potential."
"Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook  In their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants agreed that information received over the intermeeting period indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising moderately so far this year."
" Job gains had been solid, on average, since the beginning of the year, and the unemployment rate had declined, on net, over the same period."
" On a 12 -month basis, both overall inflation and the measure excluding food and energy prices had declined and were running below 2  percent ."
 Market -based measures of inflation compensation remained low;  survey -based measures of longer -term inflation expectations were little changed on balance.
" Participants generally saw the incoming information on spending and  labor market indicators as consistent, overall, with their expectations and indicated that their views of the outlook for economic growth and the labor market were little changed, on balance, since the June FOMC meeting."
" Participants continued to expect that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity would expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions would strengthen somewhat further."
" In light of continued low recent readings on inflation, participants expected  that inflation on a 12month basis would remain somewhat below 2  percent in the near term."
" However, most participants judged that inflation would stabilize around the Committee’s 2  percent  objective over the medium term."
 Data received over the intermeeting period reinforced earlier indications that real GDP growth had turned up after having  been slow in the first quarter of this year.
" As anticipated, growth in household  spending appeared to have been  stronger in the second quarter after its firstquarter  weakness."
"  However, sales of  motor vehicles had softened , and automakers  were reportedly adjusting production and assessing whether the underlying demand for automobiles had declined."
" Participants noted that the fundamentals underpinning  consumption growth, including increases in payrolls, remained solid ."
 Reports from District contacts on both manufacturing and services were also generally consistent with moderate growth in economic activity  overall.
 The unemployment rate rose slightly  to 4.4  percent  in June but remained low by historical standards.
" In addition, the  employmentto-population ratio increased."
" Participants observed that t he unemployment rate was likely close to or below its longer -run normal rate and could decline further if , as expected,  growth in output remained somewhat in excess of the potential growth rate."
" A few participants  expressed concern s about the possibility of substantial ly overshooting full employment, with one citing past difficulties in achieving a soft landing."
" However, a few participants suggested that, in a tight labor market, measured aggregate wage growth was being held down by compositional changes in employment associated with the hiring of  less experienced workers at  lower wages  than those of established workers."
" In addition, a number of Page 6Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________  participants suggested that the rate of increase in nominal wages was not low in relation to  the rate of productivity growth  and the modest rate of inflation ."
 Participants discussed the softness in inflation in recent months.
 Many participants  noted  that much of the recent decline in inflation had probably  reflected idiosyncratic factors.
" Nonetheless , PCE price inflation on a 12month basis would likely continue to be held down over the second half of the year by the effects of th ose factors , and the monthly readings might be depressed  by possible  residual seasonality in measured  PCE inflation."
" Still, most participants indicated that they expected inflation to pick up over the next couple of years from its current low level and to stabilize around the Committee’s 2  percent  objective over the medium term."
" M any participants , however,  saw some likelihood that inflation might remain below 2  percent  for longer than they currently expected, and several indicated that the risks to the inflation outlook could be tilted to the downside."
" Participants agreed that a f all in longer -term inflation expectations  would be undesirable , but they differed in their assessment s of whether inflation expectations were well anchored ."
" One participant pointed to the stability of a number of measures of inflation expectations in recent months, but a few others suggested that continuing low inflation expectations may have been a factor putting downward pressure on inflation or that inflation expectations might need to be bolstered in order to ensure their consistency with the Committee’s longer -term inflation objective."
" A number of participants noted that much of the analysis of inflation used in policymaking rested on a framework in which, for a given rate of expected inflation, the degree of upward pressure s on price s and wages rose as aggregate demand for goods and services and employment of resources increased above long -run sustainable levels."
 A few participants cited evidence suggesting  that this framework was not particularly useful in forecasting inflation.
" However, most participants thought that the framework remained valid, notwithstanding the recent absence of a pickup in inflation in the face of  a tightening labor market and real GDP growth in excess of their estimates of its potential rate."
 Participants discussed possible reasons for the coexistence of low inflation and low unemployment.
" These  includ ed a diminish ed responsiveness of prices to resource pressures, a lower natural rate of unemployment, the possibility that slack may be better measured by  labor market  indicators  other than unemployment, lags in the reaction of nominal wage growth and inflation to labor market tightening , and restraints on pricing power from global developments and from innovations to business models  spurred by advances in technology ."
" A c ouple of participants argued that the response of inflation to resource utilization could become stronger if output and employment appreciably overshot their full employment levels, although  other participants pointed out that this hypothesized nonlinear response had little  empirical support."
" In assessing recent developments in financial market conditions, participants referred to the continued low level of longer -term interest rates , in particular those on U.S Treasury securities."
 The level of such yields  appeared to reflect both low expected future short -term interest rates and depressed term premium s.
" A number of participants pointed to potential concerns about low longer -term interest rates, including the possibility that inflation expectations were too low , that yields could rise  abruptly , or that low yields were inducing investors to take on excessive risk in a search for higher returns ."
"Several participants noted that the further increases in  equity prices , together with continued  low long erterm interest rates, had led to an easing of financial conditions."
" However, different assessments were expressed about the implications of this development for the outlook for aggregate demand and, consequently, appropriate monetary policy."
" According to one view, the easing of financial conditions meant that the economic effects of the Committee’s actions in gradually removing policy accommodation had been large ly offset by other factor s influencing financial markets , and that a tighter monetary policy than otherwise was warranted."
" According to another view,  recent rises in equity prices might be part of a broad -based adjustment of asset prices to changes in longer -term financial conditions , importantly including a lower neutral real interest rate , and, therefore , the recent equity price increase s might not provide much additional impetus to aggregate spending on goods and services."
" In their discussion of monetary policy, participants reaffirmed their view that a gradual approach to removing policy accommodation was likely to remain appropriate to promote the Committee’s objectives of maximum employment and 2  percent  inflation."
 Most saw the outlook for economic activity and the labor market as little changed from their earlier projections and continued to anticipate that inflation would stabilize around the Committee’s 2 percent  objective over the medium term.
" However, some participa nts expressed concern about the recent decline in inflation, which had occurred even as resource utilization had tightened, and noted their increased uncertainty about the outlook for inflation."
 They observed that the Committee could afford to be patient under current circumstances  in deciding when to increase the federal funds rate further and argued against additional adjustments until incoming information confirmed that the recent low readings on inflation were not likely to persist and that inflation was more clearly on a path toward the Committee’s symmetric 2  percent  objective over the medium term.
" In contrast, some other participants were more worried about risks arising from a labor market that had already reached full employment and was projected to tighten further or from the easing in financial conditions that had developed since the Committee’s policy normalization process was initiated in December 2015."
" They cautioned that a delay in gradually removing policy accommodation could result in an  overshooting of the Committee’s inflation objective that would likely be costly to reverse , or that a delay could lead to an intensification of financial stability risks or to other imbalances that might prove difficult to unwind."
 One participant stressed that the risks  both to the Committee’s inflation objective and to financial stability would require careful monitoring.
 This participant expressed the view that a gradual approach to removing policy accommodation would likely  strike the appropriate balanc e between promoting the Committee’s inflation and full employment objectives and mitigating financial stability concerns.
 A number of participants also commented that the appropriate pace of normalization of the federal funds rate would depend on how finan cial conditions evolved and on the implications of those developments for the pace of economic activity.
" Several reiterated that, once the program was under way, further adjustments to the stance of monetary policy in response to economic developments would be centered on changes  in the target range for the federal funds rate."
" Committee Policy Action  In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that information received since the Committee met in June indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising moderately so far this year."
" Job gains had been solid, on average, since the beginning of the year, and the unemployment rate had declined."
" On a 12 -month basis, overall inflation and the measure excluding food and energy prices had declined and were running below 2  percent ."
 Market -based measures of inflation compensation remained low; survey -based measures of longer -term inflation expectations were little changed  on balance.
" With respect to the economic outlook and its implications for monetary policy, members continued to expect that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity would expand at a moderate pace, and labor market conditions would strengthen somewhat further."
 Inflation on a 12 -month basis was expected to remain somewhat below 2  percent  in the near term but to stabilize around the Committee’s 2  percent objective over the medium term.
" Members saw the nearterm risks to  the economic outlook as roughly balanced, but , in light of their concern about the recent slowing in inflation, they agreed to continue to monitor inflation developments closely."
" After assessing current conditions and the outlook for economic activity, th e labor market, and inflation, members decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1 to 1¼ percent ."
" They noted that the stance of monetary policy remained accommodative, thereby supporting some further strengthening in labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2  percent  inflation."
 Members agreed that the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate would depend on their assessment of realized and expected economic conditions relative to  the Committee’s objectives of maximum employment and 2  percent  inflation.
" In particular, the y reaffirmed that they would carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to the Committee’s  symmetric inflation goal."
 Some members stressed the importance of underscoring the Committee’s commitment to its inflation objective.
" These members emphasized that, in considering the timing of further adjustments in the federal funds rate, they would be evaluating incoming information to assess the likelihood that recent low readings on inflation were transitory and that inflation was again on a trajectory co nsistent with achieving the Committee’s 2  percent objective over the medium term."
 The Committee also directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve’s agency mortgage -backed securities transactions.” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00  p.m.: “Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in June indicat es that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising moderately so far this year.
" Job gains have been solid, on average, since the beginning of the year, and the unemployment rate has declined."
" On a 12month basis, overall inflation and the measure excluding food and energy prices have declined and are running below 2  percent ."
"  Market -based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey -based measures of longer -term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance."
" Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
" The Committee continues to expect that, with gradual a djustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, and labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat further."
 Inflation on a 12 -month basis is expected to remain somewhat below 2  percent  in the near term but to stabilize around the Committee’s 2 percent  objective over the medium term.
" Near -term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced, but the Committee is monitoring inflation developments closely."
" In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1 to 1¼ percent ."
" The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting some further strengthening in labor market conditions and a s ustained return to 2  percent  inflation."
" In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum emplo yment and 2  percent inflation."
" This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
 The Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to its symmetric inflation goal.
" Page 10Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________  Consiste nt with the Committee’s decision to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the Board of Governors voted unanimously to leave the interest rates on required and excess reserve balances unchanged at 1¼  percent  and voted unanimously to a pprove establishment of the primary credit rate (discount rate) at the existing level of 1¾  percent .4 It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday –Wednesday, September  19–20, 2017."
Madigan  Secretary                                                  4 The second vote of the Board also encompassed approval of the establishment of the  interest rates for secondary and seasonal credit under the existing formulas for computing such rates.
