Adjust somewhat in exceptional circumstances the stance of monetary policy and to take actions that may result in material changes in the composition and size of the assets in the SOMA; or  B.
" Any such adjustment described in subparagraph A of this paragraph 5 shall be made in the context of the Committee’s discussion and decision about the stance of policy at its most recent meeting and the Committee’s longrun objectives to foster maximum employment and price stability, and shall be based on economic, financial, Page 4Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________   and monetary developments since the most recent meeting of the Committee."
" __________________________  1 In general, as specified in Article IV, each member of the IMF undertakes to collaborate with the IMF and other members to assure orderly exchange arrangements and to promote a stable system of exchange rates."
These obligations include seeking to direct the member’s economic and financial policies toward the objective of fostering orderly economic growth with reasonable price stability.
These obligations also include avoiding manipulating exchange rates or the international monetary  system in such a way that would impede effective balance of payments adjustment or to give an unfair competitive advantage over other members.
" In the Committee’s annual reconsideration of the Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, all participants supported the statement as written, and the Committee voted unanimously to reaffirm without revision."
"  STATEMENT ON LONGER -RUN GOALS AND MONETARY POLICY STR ATEGY (As reaffirmed effective January 26, 2021)  The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is firmly committed to fulfilling its statutory mandate from the Congress of promoting maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long -term interest rates."
 The Committee seeks to explain its monetary policy decisions to the public as clearly as possible.
" Such clarity facilitates wellinformed decisionmaking by households and businesses, reduces economic and financial uncertainty, increases the effectiveness of monetary policy, and enhances transparency and accountability, which are essential in a democratic society."
" Employment, inflation, and long -term interest rates fluctuate over time in response to economic and financial disturbances."
 Monetary policy plays an important role in stabilizing the economy in response to these disturbances.
 The Committee’s primary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy is through changes in the target range for the federal funds rate.
 The Committee judges that the level  of the federal funds rate consistent with maximum employment and price stability over the longer run has declined relative to its historical average.
" Owing in part to the proximity of interest rates to the effective lower bound, the Committee judges that downward risks to employment and inflation have increased."
 The Committee is prepared to use its full range of tools to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals.
 The maximum level of employment is a broad -based and inclusive goal that is not directly measurable and changes over time owing largely to nonmonetary factors that affect the structure and dynamics of the labor market.
" Consequently, it would not be appropriate to specify a fixed goal for employment; rather, the Committee’s policy decisions must be informed by assessments of the shortfalls of employment from its maximum level, recognizing that such assessments are necessarily uncertain and subject to revision."
" The inflation rate over the longer run is primarily determined by monetary policy, and hence the Committee has the ability  to specify a longer -run goal for inflation."
" The Committee reaffirms its judgment that inflation at the rate of 2  percent , as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, is most consistent over the longer run with the Federal Reserve’s statutory mandate."
 The Committee judges that longer -term inflation expectations that are well anchored at 2  percent foster price stability and moderate long -term interest rates and enhance the Committee’s ability to promote maximum employment in the face of significant economic disturbances.
" In order to anchor longer -term inflation expectations at this level, the Committee seeks to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time, and therefore judges that, following periods when inflation has been running persistently below 2  percent , appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2  percent  for some time."
" Monetary policy actions tend to influence economic activity, employment, and prices with a lag."
" In setting monetary policy, the Committee seeks over time to mitigate shortfalls of employment from the Committee’s assessment of its maximum level and deviations of inflation from its long errun goal."
" Moreover, sustainably achieving maximum employment and price stability depends on a stable financial system."
 The Committee’s employment and inflation objectives are generally complementary.
" However, under circumstances in which the Committee judges that the objectives are not complementary, it takes into account the employment shortfalls and inflation deviations and the potentially different time horizons over which employment and inflation are projected to return to levels judged consistent with its mandate."
" The Committee intends to review these principles and to make adjustments as appropriate at its annual organizational meeting each January, and to undertake roughly every 5  years a thorough public review of its monetary policy strategy, tools, and com munication practices."
" Progress on vaccinations had been slower than expected , and the near -term trajectory of the pandemic worsened, weighing on economic activity."
" The emergence of a narrow Democratic majority in the Senate bolstered investor expectatio ns for additional fiscal stimulus, prompting upward revisions to forecasts for  economic growth this year."
" In the Open Market Desk Survey of Primary D ealers, the median 2021 gross domestic product (GDP) growth forecast rose about 1  percent age point."
" Longer -dated real yields were lifted by expectations for  improved growth and  increased Treasury issuance, but remained deeply negative."
" Measures of inflation compensation increased over the period, with the five -year, fiveyear-forward measure rising to a level of around 2  percent ."
 Gains in U.S. equities again centered on cyclical sectors and smaller -capitalization firms most sensitive to growth.
"  Expectations for the path of the target federal funds rate over the next several years , as implied by interest rate  futures and by the Desk Survey of Primary D ealers and Survey of M arket Participants , were relatively little changed from December."
 The stability in nearterm policy rate expectations amid an improving growth outlook appeared consistent with the Committee’s new framework and forward interest rate guidance.
" Although the median Desk survey respondent continued to expect _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of January 26–27, 2021Page 9   12month personal consumption expenditure (PCE) inflation of 2.3  percent  when the FOMC first lift s the target range, the median expectation for the unemployment rate prevailing at that time was modestly lower than in December."
 Staff Review of the Economic Situation  The COVID19 pandemic and the measures undertaken to contain its spread continued to affect economic activity in the United States and abroad.
" Labor market conditions deteriorated, on balance, in Decem ber, and employment continued to be well below its level at the start of 2020."
 Consumer price inflation through November —as measured by the 12 -month percentage change in the PCE price index —remained considerably lower than the rates seen in early 2020.
" Total nonfarm payroll employment fell in December, with especially sharp declines in the leisure and hospitality sector."
" As of December, payroll employment had retraced a little more than half of the losses seen at the onset of the pandemic."
 The unemployment rate held steady at 6.7  percent in December.
 T he unemployment rate for African Americans declined  and the Hispanic unemployment rate rose; both rates remained well above the national average.
" However, the Asian unemployment rate moved below the national average in December."
 Both the labor force participation rate and employment -topopulation ratio were unchanged in December.
 Initial claims for unemployment insurance in mid -January were higher than their early December level.
" Weekly estimates o f private -sector payrolls constructed by Federal Reserve Board staff using data provided by the payroll processor ADP indicated that the four -week average change in private employment in mid -January was slightly lower than it had been in early December; however, the most recent week -toweek changes in this measure of payrolls had been highly volatile."
 Total PCE price inflation was 1.1  percent  over the 12 months ending in November and continued to be held down by relatively weak aggregate demand and the declines in consumer energy prices seen over the first Page 10Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________   part of 2020.
" Core PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in consumer energy prices and many consumer food prices, was 1.4  percent  over the 12  months ending in November, while the trimmed mean measure of 12month PCE inflation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas was 1.7 percent in November."
" In December, the 12 -month change in the consumer price index (CPI) was 1.4 percent , while core CPI inflation was 1.6  percent over the same period."
 The latest readings on survey -based measures of longer -run inflation expectations ticked higher .
" In the first part of January, the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers measure for the next 5  to 10  years moved back up to its latesummer level, while in December, the 3 -yearahead measure of inflation expectations produced by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York moved back up to its August level."
" Although  home sales turned down in November, the decline appeared to reflect limited availability of homes for sale rather than weakening demand."
" The low level of export demand since the onset of the pandemic had likely continued to restrain the recovery in the manufacturing sector; in addition, production of motor vehicles and parts was a small drag on manufacturing output in the fourth quarter as automotive producers appeared to have had difficulty getting assemblies fully under way for the new model year."
" Available data suggested that real federal purchases had posted a modest gain, as an increase in defense purchases offset a reduction in nondefense purchases; however, indicators of real state and local purchases, including state and local government employment, pointed to a fourth -quarter decline similar in size to what had been seen in the third quarter."
 The nominal U.S. international trade deficit widened further in November.
" Taken together, these data suggested that net exports made a significant negative contribution to real GDP growth in the fourth quarter."
" Recent data pointed to a sharp slowing in foreign economic growth in the fourth quarter, after a strong rebound in the third quarter."
" The increased virus spread and restrictions appeared to take a toll on foreign economic activity, particularly in Europe."
" By contrast, manufacturing output in both advanced and emerging foreign economies continued to expand at a solid pace, supported by resilient demand for durable goods, hightech goods, and medical  supplies."
" Amid the generally weak economic situation, inflationary pressures remained subdued in most foreign economies."
" The nominal Treasury yield curve steepened, partly reflecting an increase in inflation compensation."
" Measures of inflation compensation based on Treasury Inflation -Protected Securities increased moderately, on net, continu ing the upward trend observed over recent months , with the increase over the intermeeting period reportedly reflecting greater prospects for additional fiscal stimulus and an associated improvement in the longer -run economic outlook."
" Financing conditions in capital markets remained broadly accommodative, supported by low interest rates and high equity valuations."
" In the January Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS), banks, on net, reported weaker demand and tightened  Page 12Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________   lending standards for C&I loans, with notable differences in reported changes across bank sizes ."
 CRE bank loan growth remained weak in the fourth quarter amid depressed property transaction volumes.
" On net, in the January SLOOS, banks reported a further tightening of lending standards and further weakening in demand for CRE loans."
" The January SLOOS suggested that for most types of residential mortgages, banks’ lending standards remained unchanged, while loan demand was either little changed  or somewhat stronger."
 Banks in the January SLOOS reported easing standards for all consumer loan types and experiencing weaker demand for auto loans and littlechanged demand for other consumer loans.
" Interest rates on new credit card offers for nonprime borrowers stayed elevated, and financing conditions remained tight for those borrowers ."
 Auto loan interest rates were about flat over the past few months and remained significantly below their pre -pandemic levels.
" Taken together, these stimulus measures were expected to partly offset the substantial drag on aggregate demand that would result from the unwinding of the fiscal stimulus enacted in the spring of 2020."
" With the boost to growth from the reduction in social distancing assumed to be largely completed by the end of 2021, GDP growth was expected to step down over the remainder of the medium term."
" Even so, the staff continued to project that real GDP growth would outpace that of potential over this period, l eading to a considerable further decline in the unemployment rate."
" Following these swings, inflation was expected to finish the year at just below 2  percent."
" Thereafter, inflation was projected to gradually edge up to 2  percent  by the end of the medium term as labor and  product markets tightened."
" With monetary policy assumed to remain accommodative, inflation was projected to moderately overshoot 2  percent  for some time in the years beyond 2023."
" The pace of the recovery in economic activity and employment had moderated in recent months, with weakness concentrated in the sectors of the economy most adversely affected by the resurgence of the virus and by greater social distancing."
 Weaker demand and earlier declines in oil prices were holding down consumer price inflation.
" Participants agreed that the path of the economy would depend significantly on the cours e of the virus, including progress on vaccinations, and that the ongoing public health crisis would continue to weigh on economic activity, employment, and inflation and posed considerable risks to the economic outlook."
" Most participants expected  that the stimulus provided by the passage of the C AA in December , the likelihood of additional fiscal support, and anticipated continued progress in vaccinations would lead to a sizable boost in economic activity."
" Even so, participants noted that economic activity and employment were currently well below levels consistent with achieving maximum employment."
  The relative  strength in consumer spending on goods was supported by fiscal programs such as federal stimulus payments and expanded unemployment benefits as well as by accommodative monetary policy.
  Participants also observed that residential investment and home sales remained robust; low interest rates were viewed as an important factor supporting the strength in housing activity.
  Many  participants stressed that sustained support from fiscal policy would help address the hardships faced by these groups and that monetary policy could also help by promoting the economy’s return to maximum employment and price stability.
"  As with overall economic activity, the pace of improvement in the labor market had slowed in recent months."
" Payroll employment fell in December, as continued job gains in many industries were outweighed by significant layoffs in industries where the resurgence of the virus had weighed heavily on activity."
" While labor market conditions had improved significantly, on balance,  since the spring, some participants noted that if the sizable number of workers who reported having left the labor force since the beginning of the pandemic were to be counted as unemployed, the unemployment rate would be substantially hi gher."
" Over the medium term, participants expected strong growth in employment, driven by continued progress on vaccinations and an associated rebound of economic activity and of consumer and business confidence, as well as accommodative fisc al and monetary policy ."
" However, participants observed that the economy was far from achieving the Committee’s broad -based and inclusive goal  of m aximum employment and that even with a brisk pace of improvement in the labor market, achieving this goal would take some time."
" In their comments about inflation, participants noted that headline PCE price inflation in December , measured on a 12 -month basis, was poised to come in  well below the Committee’s 2 percent  longer -term objecti ve."
" Many participants stressed the importance of distinguishing between  such onetime changes in relative prices and changes in the underlying trend for  inflation , noting  that changes in relative prices could temporarily raise measured inflation bu t would be unlikely to have a lasting effect."
 Some participants further observed that 12month PCE inflation was likely to move somewhat above 2  percent  for a brief period in the spring as the unusually low monthly observations from last spring roll out of the 12 -month calculation.
" Outside of such near -term fluctuations , participants generally anticipated that inflation would move up along a trajectory consistent with achieving the Committee’s objectives  over time, supported by  stronger economic activity, widespread vaccinations and the associated reduction in social distancing, and accommodative fiscal and monetary policy."
" Some participants  pointed to the continued increase in marketbased measures of inflation compensation from the very low levels recorded in the spring as consistent _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of January 26–27, 2021Page 15   with the view that inflation was likely to move up gradually over time; others noted that survey -based measures were little changed, on net, over the year as a whole."
" Participants noted that overall financial conditions remained highly accommodative, in part reflecting investors’ optimism about the economic outlook along with the accommodative stance of monetary policy and recent and e xpected future fiscal policy measures."
"While generally acknowledging that the medium -term outlook for real GDP growth and employment had improved, participants continued to see the uncertainty surrounding that outlook as elevated."
" With regard to upside risks, some participants pointed to the possibility that fiscal policy could turn out to be more expansionary than anticipat ed, that household s could display greater willingness to spend out of accumulated savings  than expected, or that widespread vaccinations and easing of social distancing could result in a more rapid boost to spending  and employment than anticipated ."
" Participants generally viewed the risks to the outlook for inflation as having become more balanced than was the case over most of 2020, although  most still viewed the risks as weighted to the downside ."
" As an upside risk to inflation, severa l participants noted the potential for pandemicrelated supply constraints to affect price inflation somewhat more than anticipated or for price increases among industries most adversely affected by the pandemic to be more pronounced  than projected."
"   In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, participants reaffirmed the Federal Reserve’s commitment to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy during this challenging time, thereby promoting the Committee’s statutory goals of maximum employment and price stability."
" Participants agreed that the path of the economy would depend significantly on the course of the virus, including progress on vaccinations, and that the ongoing public health crisis had continued to weigh on economic activity, employment, and inflation."
" In their discussion of the outlook for monetary policy, participants judged that maintaining a highly accommodative stance of policy was essential to foster further Page 16Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________   economic recovery and to achieve an average inflation rate of 2 percent over time."
" For example, if progress toward the Committee’s goals proved slower than anticipated, the outcome -based guidance would convey the Committee’s intention to respond by increasing monetary policy accommodation through maintaining the current level of the target range of the federal funds rate for longer and raising the expected path of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet."
" In that context, p articipants emphasized that  it was important to abstract from temporary factors affecting inflation—such as low past levels of prices dropping out of measures of annual price changes or relative price i ncreases in some sectors  brought about by supply constraints or disruptions —in judging whether inflation was on track to moderately exceed 2  percent  for some time."
 The Committee’s guidance for asset purchases indicated that asset purchases would continue at least at the current pace until substantial further progress toward its employment and inflation goals had been achieved.
" Committee Policy Action  In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that the COVID -19 pandemic was causing tremendous human and economic hardship across the United States and around the world."
" They noted that the pace of recovery in economic activity and employment had moderated in recent months, with weakness concentrated in sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic."
 Weaker demand and earlier declines in oil prices had been holding  down consumer price inflation.
" In addition, members agreed that the ongoing public health crisis had continued to weigh on economic activity, employment, and inflation and was posing considerable risks to the economic outlook."
" All members reaffirmed that, in accordance with the Committee’s goals to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2  percent over the longer run and with inflation running persistently below this longer -run goal, they would aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2  percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer -term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2  percent ."
Members expected to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until those outcomes were achieved.
" All members agreed to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent , and they expected that it would be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions had reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessments of maximum employment and inflation had risen to 2  percent  and was on track to moderately exceed 2  percent for some time."
" In addition, members agreed that it would be appropriate for the Federal Reserve to continue to increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and agency mortgagebacked securities  by at least $40 billion per m onth until substantial further progress _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of January 26–27, 2021Page 17   had been made toward the Committee’s maximum -employment and price -stability goals."
" Members agreed that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and that they would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate in the event that risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals."
" Members also agreed that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments."
"• Engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve’s agency MBS transactions.”  The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2:00 p.m.:  “The Federal Reserve is commit ted to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum employment and price stability goals."

 Weaker demand and earlier declines in oil prices have be en holding down consumer price inflation.
" The ongoing public health crisis continues to weigh on economic activity, employment, and inflation, and poses considerable risks to the economic outlook."
 The Committee seeks to achieve m aximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2  percent over the longer run.
" With inflation running persistently below this longer -run goal, the Committee will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2  percent  for some time so Page 18Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________   that inflation averages 2  percent  over time and longer -term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2  percent ."
 The Committee expects to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomes are achieved.
 The Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent  and expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2  percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2  percent  for some time.
