"Winford, Information Management Analyst , Division of Monetary Affairs, Board of Governors                                                    3 Attended through the discussion of the long -run monetary policy implementation frameworks."
"  Samuel Schulhofer -Wohl,2 Senior Economist and Research Advisor, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago   Fabrizio Perri, Monetary Advisor, Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis   Long -Run Monetary Policy Implementation Frameworks  Committee participants resumed their discussion from the November 2018 FOMC meeting of potential long -run frameworks for monetary policy implementation."
 The staff reviewed a number of steps that the Federal Reserve could take to ensure effective monetary policy implementation were upward pressures on the federal funds rate and other mon ey market rates to emerge.
" Reducing reserves close to the lowest level that still corresponded to the flat portion of the reserve demand curve would be one approach consistent with the Committee’s previously stated intention, in the Policy Normalization Principles and Plans that it issued in 2014, to “ hold no more securities than necessary to implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively.”   However, reducing reserves to a point very close to the level at which the reserve demand curve begins to slope upward could lead to a significant increase  in the volatility in short -term interest rates and require frequent sizable open market operations or new ceiling facilities to maintain effective interest rate control ."
 These considerations  suggest ed that it might be  appropriate to instead provid e a buffer of  reserves sufficient to ensure that the Federal Reserve operates consistently on the flat portion of the reserve demand curve so as to promote the efficient and effective implementation of monetary policy.
 Participants  discussed options for maintaining control of interest rates  should upward pressures on money market rates emerge during  the transition  to a regime with lower excess reserves .
" In addition,  participants discussed options such as  ending portfolio redemptions with a relatively high level of reserves still in the s ystem  and then either maintaining that  level of reserves  or allowing growth in nonreserve liabilities to very gradually reduce reserves further ."
 These approaches could  allow markets and banks more time to adjust to lower reserve levels while maintaining effective control of interest rates .
" Several  participants , however, expressed concern  that a slowing of redemptions c ould be misinterpreted as a sign al about the stance of monetary policy."
 Many participan ts noted that the magnitudes of these nonreserve liabilities —most significantly curren cy but also liabilities to the Treasury through the Treasury General Account and liabilities to foreign official institutions through their accounts at the Federal Reserve —are not closely related to Federal Reserve monetary policy decisions .
 They also rem arked  that the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet was expected to increase over time as the growth of these liabilities roughly tracks the growth of nominal gross domestic product (GDP ).
" In discussing the long -run level of reserve liabilities, participants  noted that it might be useful to explore ways to encourage banks to reduce their demand for reserves and to provide information to banks and the public about the likely long -run level of reserves."
" In addition, investors pointed to concerns about the global growth outlook, the unsettled state of Brexit negotiations, and uncertainties about the political situation in Europe."
" Based on readings from Treasury Inflation -Protected Securities  (TIPS), the decline in nominal Treasury yields was associated with a notable drop in inflation compensation."
 A sizable decline in oil prices was cited as an important factor contributing to the drop in measures of inflation compensation.
" Desk surveys indicated that respondents placed high odds on a further quarter -point firming in the stance of monetary policy at the December meeting, but lower than the near certainty of a rate increase reported just before previous policy firmings in 2018; survey responses anticipated that the median projected path of the federal funds rate in the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) would show only two additional quarter -point policy firmings next year —down from the three policy firmings in the median path in the September SEP results."
" However, if longer -term interest rates moved substantively lower than assum ed in the baseline, some modest reinvestments in MBS could occur for a few months next year concurrent with the pickup in seasonal turnover."
Staff Review of the Economic Situation  The information reviewed for the December 18 –19 meeting indicated that labor market conditions continued to strengthen in recent months and that real GDP  growth  was strong.
" Consumer price inflation, as measured by the 12 -month percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), was 2 percent in October."
 Survey -based measures  of longer -run inflation expectations were little changed on balance.
" Total nonfarm payroll employment expanded further in November, and job gains were strong, on average, over recent months."
" The national unemployment rate remained at a very low level of 3.7 percent, and both the labor force participation rate and the employmentto-population ratio also stayed flat in November."
" The unemployment rates for African Americans, Asians, and Hispanics in November were below their levels at the end of the previous economic expansion."
" Real PCE growth was brisk in October, and the components of the nominal retail sales used by the Bureau of Economic Analysis to construct its estimate of PCE rose considerably in November."
 Key factors that influence consumer spending —including ongoing gains in real disposable personal income and the effects of earlier increases  in equity prices and home values on households’ net worth—continued to be supportive of solid real PCE growth in the near term.
" Real residential investment appeared to be declining further in the fourth quarter, likely reflecting in part the effects of the rise in mortgage interest rates over the past year on the affordability of housing."
 Growth in real private expenditures for business equipment and intellectual property looked to be picking up solidly in  the fourth quarter after moderating in the previous quarter.
 Nominal defense spending in October and November pointed to solid growth in real federal purchases.
 The nominal U.S. international trade deficit widened slightly in October.
 Available trade data suggested that the contribution of the change in net exports to the rate of real GDP growth in the fourth quarter would be much less negative than the drag of nearly 2  percentage points in the third quarter.
" Core PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in consumer food and energy prices, was 1.8 percent over that same period."
" The consumer price index (CPI ) rose 2.2 percent over the 12 months ending in November, and core CPI inflation was also 2.2 percent."
" Recent readings on surveybased measures of longer -run inflation expectations —including those from the Michigan survey, the Survey of Professional Forecasters, and the Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants —were little changed on balance."
" Foreign economic growth continued at a moderate pace in the third quarter, as a pickup in emerging market economies (EMEs) roughly offset slowing growth in advanced foreign economies (AFEs)."
" Among EMEs, growth in Mexico and Brazil bounced back from transitory second -quarter weakness, more than offsetting a slowdown in China and India."
" The softness in AFE growth partly reflected temporary  factors, including disruptions from natural disasters in Japan and the adoption of new car emissions testing in Germany."
 Indicators for economic activity in the fourth  quarter were consistent with continued moderate foreign  economic  growth.
" Underlying inflation pressures, especially in some AFEs, remained muted."
 Financing conditions for businesses and households tightened a bit but generally remained supportive of economic growth.
" Investor perceptions of increased downside risks to the outlooks for domestic and foreign economic growth, including growing concerns over trade frictions between the United States and China, reportedly weighed on yields."
 Measures of inflation compensation derived from TIPS also decreased notably over the period along with the decl ines in oil prices.
" Concerns over escalating trade tensions, global growth prospects, and the sustainability of corporate earnings growth were among the factors that appeared to contribute to a significant drop in U.S. equity prices."
" Over the intermeeting period, foreign financial markets were affected by perceived increases in downside risks to the global growth outlook and ongoing uncertainty about trade relations between the United States and China."
 Investors also focused on the state of negotiations  over Brexit and the Italian government budget deficit.
" Measures of inflation compensation generally fell, partly reflectin g sharp decreases in oil prices."
 Issuance of nonagency CMBS was stable while CRE  loan growth remained strong at banks.
" Financing conditions in the residential mortgage market also remained accommodative for most borrowers, but the demand for mortgage credit softened."
" Broad consumer credit grew at a solid pace through September, though October and November saw credit card growth at banks edge a bit lower on average."
" Staff Economic Outlook  With some stronger -thanexpected incoming data on economic activity and the rece nt tightening in financial conditions, particularly the decline in equity prices, the U.S. economic forecast prepared by the staff for the December FOMC meeting was little revised on balance."
" The staff continued to expect that real GDP growth would be str ong in the fourth quarter of 2018, although somewhat slower than the rapid pace of growth in the previous two quarters."
" Over the 2018 –20 period, real GDP was forecast to rise at a rate above the staff’s estimate of potential output growth and then slow to a pace below it in 2021."
 The unemployment rate was projected to decline further below the staff’s estimate of its longer -run natural rate but to bottom out by 2020 and begin to edge up in 2021.
" With labor market conditions already tight, the staff conti nued to assume that projected employment gains would manifest in smaller -thanusual downward pressure on the unemployment rate and in larger -thanusual upward pressure on the labor  force participation rate."
" The staff expected both total and core  PCE price inflation to be just a touch below 2  percent in 2018, with total inflation revised down a bit because of recent declines in consumer energy prices."
" Core PCE price inflation was forecast to move up to 2 percent in 2019 and remain at that level t hrough the medium term; total inflation was forecast to be a little below core inflation in 2019, reflecting projected declines in energy prices, and then to run at the same level as core inflation over the following two years."
 The staff’s medium -term pro jections for both total and core PCE price inflation were little revised on net.
"The staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as similar to the average of the past 20 years."
 The staff also saw the risks to the forecasts for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate as balanced.
" On the downside, trade policies and foreign economic developments could move in directions that have significant negative effects on U.S. economic growth."
" Risks to the inflation Minutes of the Meeting of December 18–19, 2018Page 7_____________________________________________________________________________________________   projection also were seen as balanced."
 The upside risk that inflation could increase more than expected in an economy that was projected to move further above its potential was counterbalanced by the downside risk that longer -term inflation expectations may be lower than was assumed in the staff forecast.
" Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook  In conjunction with this FOMC meeting,  members of the Board of Governors and Federal Reserve Bank presidents submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2018 through 2021 and over the longer run, based on their individual assessments of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate."
" The longer -run projections represented each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy."
" In their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants agreed that information received since the FOMC met in November indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising at a strong rate."
" Job gains had been strong, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate had remained low."
" Household spending had continued to grow strongly, while growth of business fixed investment had moderated from its rapid pace earlier in the year."
" On a 12 -month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy remained near 2 percent."
 Indicators of longer -term inflation expectations were little changed on balance.
" Recent readings on household and business spending, inflation, and labor market conditions were largely in line with participants’ expectations and indicated continued strength of the economy."
" After taking into account incoming economic  data, information from business contacts,  and the tightening  of financial  conditions , participants generally revised down their individual assessments of the appropriate path for monetary policy and indicated either no material change  or only a modest downward revision  in their assessment of the economic outlook."
 Economic growth was expected to remain abov e trend in 2019 and then slow to a pace closer to trend over the medium term.
" Participants who downgraded their assessment of the economic outlook pointed to a variety of factors underlying their assessment, including recent financial market developments,  some softening in the foreign economic growth outlook, or a more pessimistic outlook for  housing -sector  activity."
"  In their discussion of the household sector, participants generally  characterize d real PCE growth as remaining strong."
" However, contacts in a number of  Districts appeared less upbeat than at the time of the November meeting, as concerns about a variety of factors—including trade policy, waning fiscal stimulus, slowing global economic growth, or financial market volatility —were reportedly beginning to weigh on business sentiment."
  A couple  of participants commented that the recent decline in oil prices could be a sign of a weakening in global demand that could  weigh  on capital spending by oil production  companies  and affect  companies providing services to the oil industry.
" However, Page 8Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________   a couple  of participants noted that t he recent oil price decline could also be associated with increasing oil supply rather than softening global demand ."
" The unemployment rate remained at a historically low level in November, and the labor force participation rate stayed steady, which represented an improvement relative to its gradual downward -sloping underlying  trend."
" Many participants observed that, at the national level, most measures of nominal wage growth had risen and were currently at levels that were broadly in line with trends in productivity growth and inflation."
"  Participants observed that both overall and core PCE price inflation remained near 2 percent on a 12 -month basis, but that core inflation had edged lower in recent months."
 A few  participants  noted that the recent declines in energy prices would likely only temporarily weigh on headline inflation.
" Several participants remark ed that longer -term TIPS -based inflation compensation had declined notably since November, concurrent with both falling oil prices and a deterioration in investor risk sentiment."
" A few participants pointed to the decline  in longer -term inflation compensation as an indication that longer -run inflation expectations may have edged lower , while several  others cited survey -based  measures as suggesting that longer -run expectations likely remained anchored."
 P articipants generally  continued to view recent price developments as consistent with their expectation that inflation would remain near the Committee’s symmetric 2  percent objective on a sustained basis.
" Although a few  participants pointed to anecdotal and survey evidence indicating rising input costs and passthrough of these higher costs to consumer prices, reports from business contacts and surveys in some  other Di stricts suggested some moderation in inflationary pressure."
 Some participants commented that the se developments may reflect an increased focus among market participants on tail risks such as a sharp escalation of trade tensions  or could be a signal of  a significant  slowdown in the pace of economic  growth  in the future .
" Participants commented on a number of risks associated with their outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation over the  medium term."
" Various factors that could pose downside risks for domestic economic growth and inflation were mentioned, including the possibilities of a sharper -thanexpected slowdown in global economic growth, a more rapid waning of fiscal stimulus, an escalation in trade tensions , a further tightening of financial conditions , or greater -thananticipated negative effects from the monetary policy tightening to date ."
" A few  participants expressed concern that longer -run inflation expectations would remain low, particularly if economic growth slowed more than expected."
" With regard to upside risks, participants noted that the effects of fiscal stimulus could turn out to be greater than expected  and the uncertainties surrounding trade tensions or the global growth outlook could be resolved favorably, leading to stronger -thanexpected economic outcomes , while a couple  of participants suggested that  tightening resource utilization in conjunction with an increase in the ability of firms to pass through increases in Minutes of the Meeting of December 18–19, 2018Page 9_____________________________________________________________________________________________   input costs to consumer prices could generate undesirable upward pressure on inflation."
"   In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, participants generally judged that the economy was evolving about as anticipated, with real economic activity rising at a strong rate, labor market conditions continuing to strengthen, and inflation near the Committee’s objective."
" A few  participants, however, favored no chang e in the target range at  this meeting, judging that the absence of signs of upward inflation pressure afforded the Committee some latitude to wait and see how the data would develop amid the recent rise in financial market volatility and increased uncertainty about the global eco nomic growth outlook."
"  With regard to the outlook for monetary policy beyond this meeting, participants generally  judged that  some further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would most likely be consistent with a sustained economic expansion, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near 2 percent over the medium term."
" With an increase in the target range at this meeting, the federal funds rate would be at or close to the lower end of the range of estimates of the  longer -run neutral interest rate , and participants expressed that recent developments, including the volatility in financial markets and the increased concerns about global growth, made the appropriate extent and timing of future policy firming  less clear  than earlier ."
" Against th is backdrop , many  participants  expressed the view that, especially in an environment of muted inflation pressures, the Committee could afford to be patient about further policy firming."
" A number of participants  noted that, before making further changes to the stance of policy, it was important for the Committee to assess factors such as how the risks that had become more pronounced in recent months might unfold and to what extent they would affect economic activity, and the effects of past  actions to remove policy accommodation, which were likely still working their way through the economy."
 Monetary policy was not on a preset course; neither the pace nor the ultimate endpoint of future rate increases was known.
" Committee Policy Action  In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that information received since the Committee met in November indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising at a strong rate."
" Job gains had been strong, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate had remained low."
" Household spending had continued to grow strongly, while growth of business fixed investment had moderated from its rapid pace earlier in the year."
" On a 12 -month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy remained near 2 percent."
" Indicators of longer -term inflation expectations were little changed, on balance."
" Though financial conditions had tightened  and Page 10Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________   global growth had moderated, members generally anticipated that growth would remain above trend and the labor market would remain strong ."
" Members judged that some further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would be consistent with sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective over the medium term."
"  After assessing current conditions and the outlook for economic activity, t he labor market, and inflation, members decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 2¼ to 2½  percent."
 Members agreed that the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate would depend on their assessment of realized and expected economic conditions relative to the Committee’s maximum employment and symmetric 2 percent inflation objectives.
" They reiterated that this assessment would take into account a wide range of information, including measures  of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00  p.m.: “Information received since the Fede ral Open Market Committee met in November indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising at a strong rate.

" In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 2¼ to 2½  percent ."

" To support the Committee’s decision to raise the tar get range for the federal funds rate, the Board of Governors voted unanimously to raise the interest rates on re quired and excess reserve balances to 2.40 percent , effective December 20 , 2018."
" (Secret ary’s note:  Subsequently, the Federal Reserve Banks of New York, Philadelphia, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas were informed by the Secretary of the Board’s approval of their establishment of a primary credit rate of 3.00  percent, effective December 20, 2018.)  The second vote of the Board also encompassed approval of the establishment of the interest rates for secondary and seasonal credit under the existing formulas for computing such rates."
" Page 12Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________    Summary of Economic Projections   In conjunction with the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting held on December  18–19, 2018, meeting participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real gross domestic  product (GDP) growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2018 to 2021 and over the longer run.1  Each participant’s projections were based on information available at the time of the meeting, together with his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy —including a path for the federal funds rate and its longer -run value —and assumptions about other factors likely to affect economic outcomes."
" The longer -run projections represent each participant’s assessment of the value to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy.2  “Appropriate monetary policy” is defined as the future path of policy that each participant deems most likely to foster outcomes for economic activity and inflation that best satisfy his or her individual interpretation of the statutory mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability."
" All participants who submitted longer -run projections expected that , under appropriate monetary policy, growth in real GDP in 2019  would run somewhat above their individual estimate of its longer -run rate."
" Most participants  continued to expect real GDP growth to slow throughout the projection horizon, with a majority of participants  projecting  growth in 2021 to be a little below their estimate of its  longer -run rate."
 Almost a ll participants  who submitted longer -run projections continued to expect that the unemployment rate would run below their estimate of its l onger -run level through 2021 .
" Most p articipants  projected that inflation, as measured by the four -quarter percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), would increase slightly over the ne xt two years , and nearly all participants  expected that it would be at or slightly above  the Committee’s 2  percent objective in 2020 and 2021."
" Compared with the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) from September , many participants  marked down slightly their projections for real GDP growth and inflation in 2019."
" As shown in figure 2, participants generally  continued to expect that the evolution of the economy, relative to their objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation, would likely warrant some further gradual increases in the federal funds rate."
" While most participants viewed the r isks to the outlook as balanced, a couple more participants  than in September saw risks to real GDP growth as weighted to the downside , and one less  participant viewed the risks to inflation as weighted to the upside."
"   The Outlook for Economic Activity  The median of participants’ projections for the growth rate of real GDP  for 2019, conditional on their individual assessment of appropriate monetary policy, w as 2.3 percent , slower  than the  3.0 percent pace expected  for 201 8."
" Most participants  continued to expect GDP growth to slow throughout the projection horizon, with the median pr ojection at 2.0 percent  in 2020 and at 1.8 percent  in 2021, a touch lower than the median estimate of its longer -run rate  of 1.9 percent ."
" Relative to  the September SEP, the median s of the projections for real GDP growth for 201 8 and 201 9 were slightly lower , while the median for the longerrun rate of growth was a bit higher."
 Several participants mentioned  tighter financial conditions  or a softer global economic outlook  as factors behind the  downward revisions  to their near -term growth estimates .
"The median of projections for the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of 201 9 was 3.5  percent, unchanged from the September  SEP and almost 1  percentage point below the median assessment of its longer -run normal level."

Projections for the unemployment rate are for the average civilian unemployment rate in the fourthquarter of the year indicated.
Each participant’s projections are based on his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy.
Longerrun projections represent each participant’sassessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy.

" Nevertheless, most participants  continue d to project that the unemployment rate in 2021 would  still be well below their estimates of its longer -run level."
 T he median estimate of the longer -run normal rate of unemployment was slightly lower than in September.
 Figures 3.A and 3.B show the distributions of participants’ projections for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate from 2018 to 2021 and in  the longer run.
" The distribution s of individual projections for real GDP growth for 2019 and 2020 shifted down relative to th ose in the September SEP, while the distribution s for 2021 and for the l onger -run rate of GDP growth w ere little changed."
" The dis tribution  of individual projections for the unemployment rate in 201 9 was a touch more dispersed relative to the distribution of the September projections ; the distribution  moved  slightly higher for  2020, while the distribution for the longer -run normal rate shifted  toward the lower end of its range ."
"The Outlook for Inflation  The median of projections for total PCE price inflation was 1.9 percent in 2019, a bit lower than in the September SEP, while the med ians for 2020 and 2021 were 2.1 percent, the same as in the previous projections."
" The medians of projections for core PCE price inflation over the 2019 –21 period were 2 .0 percent, a touch lower than in September."
 Some participants pointed to  softer incoming data  or recent declines in oil prices  as reasons for shaving their projections for inflation.
  Figures 3.C and 3.D provide information on the distributions of participants’ views about the outlook for inflation.
" On the whole, the distributions of projections for total PCE price inflation and core PCE price inflation beyond this year  either shifted slightly to the left or were unchanged relative to the September SEP."
 Most participants  revised down slightly their projections of  total PCE price inflation for 2019.
 All participants expected  that total PCE price  inflation would  be in a range from 2 .0 to 2.3 percent in 2020 and 2021.
 Most participants  projected that core PCE inflation would run at 2.0 to 2.
Appropriate Monetary Policy Figure 3.E shows distributions of participants’ judgments regarding the appropriate target—or midpoint of the target range —for the federal funds rate at  the end of each year from 2018 to 2021 and over the longer run.
" That anticipated pace reflected a few facto rs, such as a short -term neutral real interest rate that is currently low  and an inflation rate that has been rising only gradually  to the Committee’s 2  percent objective ."
 Some participants cited a weaker near -term trajectory for economic growth or a muted response of inflation to tight labor market conditions as factors contributing to the downward revisions in their assessments of the appropriate path for the policy rate.
" As a reference, table  2 provides measures of forecast uncertainty —based on the forecast errors of various private and government forecasts over the past 20 years —for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and total PCE price inflation."

" As described in the box “Forecast Uncertainty,” under cert ain assumptions, there is about a 70 percent probability that actual outcomes for real GDP, unemployment, consumer prices, and the federal funds rate will be in ranges implied by the average size of projection errors made in the past."
" Participants’ assessments of the level of  uncertainty surrounding their individual economic projections are shown in the bottom -left panels of figures  4.A, 4.B, and 4.C.  P articipants  generally continued to view the degree of uncertainty attached to their economic projections for real GDP growth and inflation as broadly similar to the average of the past 20  years.3  A couple  more participants than in September  viewed the uncertainty around the unemployment rate as higher than average."
" Participants’ assessments of the balance of risks to their economic projections are shown in the bottom -right panels of figures 4.A, 4.B, and 4.C.  Most participants generally  judged the risks to the outlook for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, headline inflation, and core inflation as broadly balanced —in other words, as broadly                                                  3 At the end of this summary, the box “Forecast Uncertainty” discusses the sources and interpretation of uncertainty surrounding the economic forecasts and explains the approach consistent with  a symmetric fan chart."
" Two more participants  than in September saw the risks to real GDP growth as weighted to the downside, and one less  judged the risks as weighted to the upside."
"  The balance of risks to the projection for the unemployment rate was unchanged, with three participants  judging the risks to the unemployment rate as weighted to the downside and two participants  viewing the risks as weighted to the upside."
" In additi on, the balance of risks to the inflation projection s shifted down  slightly relative to September, as one less  participant judged the risks to both total and core inflation as weighted to the upside and one more  participant viewed the risks as weighted to the downside."
" In discussing the uncertainty and risks surrounding their economic projections, participants mentioned trade tensions as well as  financial and foreign  economic developments  as sources of un certainty or downside risk to the growth outlook."
" For the inflation outlook, the effects of trade restrictions  were cited as upside risks and lower energy prices and the stronger dollar  as downside risks."
" Because the Committee adjusts the federal funds rate in response to actual and prospective developments over time in real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation, uncertainty surrounding the projected path for the federal funds rate importantly reflects the uncertainties about the paths for those key economic variables along with other factors."

"The conﬁdence interval is not strictly consistent with theprojections for the federal funds rate, primarily because these projections are not forecasts of the likeliest outcomes forthe federal funds rate, but rather projections of participants’ individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy.Still, historical forecast errors provide a broad sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rategenerated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policythat may be appropriate to oﬀset the eﬀects of shocks to the economy.The conﬁdence interval is assumed to be symmetric except when it is truncated at zero—the bottom of the lowesttarget range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted in the past by the Committee."
This truncation wouldnot be intended to indicate the likelihood of the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary policyaccommodation if doing so was judged appropriate.
"Because currentconditions may diﬀer from those that prevailed, on average, over the previous 20 years, the width and shape of theconﬁdence interval estimated on the basis of the historical forecast errors may not reﬂect FOMC participants’ currentassessments of the uncertainty and risks around their projections.* The conﬁdence interval is derived from forecasts of the average level of shortterm interest rates in the fourthquarter of the year indicated; more information about these data is available in table 2."
"The shaded area encompassesless than a 70 percent conﬁdence interval if the conﬁdence interval has been truncated at zero.Summary of Economic Projections of the Meeting of December 18–19, 2018Page 15_____________________________________________________________________________________________      Forecast Uncertainty The economic projections provided by the members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks inform discussions of monetary policy among policymakers and can aid public understanding of the basis for policy actions."
" Thus, in setting the stance of monetary policy, participants consider not only what appears to be the most likely economic outcome as embodied in their projections, but also the range of alternative possibilities, the likelihood of their occurring, and the potential costs to the economy should they occur."
" Table 2 summarizes the average historical accur acy of a range of forecasts, including those reported in past Monetary Policy Report s and those prepared by the Federal Reserve Board’s staff in advance of meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)."
" The corresponding 70  percent confidence intervals for overall inflation would be 1.8 to 2.2  percent in the current year and 1.0 to 3.0  percent in the second, third, and fourth years."
" Figures 4.A through 4.C illustrate these confidence bounds in “fan charts” that are symmetric and centered on the medians of FOMC participants’ projections for GDP g rowth, the unemployment rate, and inflation."
" In particular, the unemployment rate cannot be negative; furthermore, the risks around a particular projection might be tilted  to either the upside or the downside, in which case the corresponding fan chart would be asymmetrically positioned around the median projection."
" These judgments are summarized in the lower -right panels of figures 4.A through 4.C.  As with real activity and inflation, the outlook for the future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable uncertainty."
 This uncertainty arises primarily because each participant ’s assessment of the appropriate stance of monetary policy depends importantly on the evolution of real activity and inflation over time.
 The final line in table  2 shows the error ranges for forecasts of short -term interest rates.
" It should be noted, however, that these confidence intervals are not strictly consistent with the projections for the federal funds rate, as these projections are not forecasts of the most likely quarterly outcomes but rather are projections of pa rticipants’ individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy and are on an end -ofyear basis."
" However, the forecast errors should provide a sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy that would be appropriate to offset the effects of shocks to the economy."
 This approach to the construction of the federal funds rate fan chart would be merely a convention; it would not have any implications for possible future policy decisions regarding the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so were appropria te.
