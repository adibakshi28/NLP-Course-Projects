" Nominal Treasury yields declined moderately across the curve, on net, but continued to be very sensitive to incoming data surprises, especially those pertaining to inflation and the labor market."
" Inflation compensation also fell somewhat, especially at shorter horizons."
 Longerterm inflation expectations remained well anchored.
 The median of  modal paths of  the federal funds rate obtained from the Open Market Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants—taken before the May employment report—was also little changed.
The manager also discussed the responses to a Desk survey question about the most likely spread between the effective federal funds rate and the interest rate on reserve balances at different levels of the sum of reserves and ON RRP balances.
Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information available at the time of the meeting suggested that U.S. economic activity had expanded at a solid pace so far this year.
" Job gains continued to be strong, while the unemployment rate had ed ged up but was still low."
"Consumer price inflation was running well below where it was a year earlier, but further progress toward the _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of June 11–12, 2024Page 3Committee’s 2 percent inflation objective had been modest in recent months."
" Consumer price inflation—as measured by the 12month change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE)—was about the same inApril as at the end of last year, although recent monthover-month readings of PCE prices were lower than earlier this year."
" Total PCE price inflation was 2.7 percentin April, and core PCE price inflation—which excludeschanges in energy prices and many consumer foodprices—was 2.8 percent."
" The consumer price index(CPI) in May showed that the 12month change measureof total CPI inflation was 3.3 percent and core CPI inflation was 3.4 percent, and recent monthly CPI readingswere lower than earlier this year."
" Although some surveybased measures of shortterm inflation expectations ha dmoved up, longerterm expectations were little changedand stood at levels consistent with those that prevailedjust before the pandemic.Labor demand and supply cont inued to move into better balance."
 Total nonfarm payroll employment increased at only a somewhat slower average monthly pace over April and May than the strong rate recorded in the first quarter.
" The recently released fourthquarter data from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages suggested that while the strong reported rate of payroll increases last year may have been overstated, job gains were still solid."
" In May, the unemployment rate ticked up further to 4.0 percent, while the labor force participation rate and the employmentto-population ratio both moved down a little."
 The unemployment rates for African Americans and for Hispanics were somewhat higher in May than in the fi rst quarter; both rates were above those for Asians and for Whites.
" The ratio of job vacancies to unemployment declined further to 1.2 in May, about the same as its prepandemic level."
"Real exports of goods edged up in April relative to March, following tepid growth in the first quarter."
" Overall, the nominal U.S. international trade deficit widened in April, as imports of goods and services ro se more than exports."
  Foreign GDP growth firmed in the first quarter.
" In emerging market economies (EMEs), including China, growth was supported by strong external demand."
" The firstquarter surge in economic activity in China was also boosted by policy support, especially from fiscal policy."
"More recent Chinese data, however, especially a steep drop in lending to households and businesses in April, pointed to a considerable slowdown in China’s economic activity in this quarter."
"Headline inflation continued to  ease in the advanced foreign economies (AFEs) through May, albeit at a slower pace than last year."
" While core inflation had slowed significantly, the core nonhousing services component remained elevated in several regions, partly reflecting strong nominal wage growth."
" Inflation inched up in EMEs, in part because of weatherrelated increases in food prices in some countries."
" The Riksbank, the BOC, and the ECB cut their policy rates as market participants expected, amid easing inflation."
 Options on interest rate futures suggested that market participants were placing higher odds on policy easing by early 2025 than  they did just before the April FOMC meeting.
" Inflation compensation also fell some, with larger declines at nearer horizons."
 Marketbased measures of interest rate uncertainty ticked down but remained elevated by historical standards.
"Broad stock price indexes increa sed substantially, on net, amid a positive investor outlook on corporate profits and economic activity."
" Interest rates on new credit card offe rs were little changed in April at high levels, as were rates on new auto loans."
 Interest rates on commercial and industrial (C&I) loans and small business loans also remained elevated.
" CRE loans at banks continued to increase in April and May, dr iven by growth in multifamily and nonfarm nonresidential loans."
" The economy was expected to maintain a high rate of resource utilization over the next few years, with real GDP growth projected to be roughly similar to the staff’s estimate of potential output growth."
The unemployment rate was expected to edge down slightly over the remainder of this year and the next and then to remain roug hly flat in 2026.
  Total and core PCE price inflation were both projected to be lower at the end of this year than they were at the end of last year.
" The staff’s inflation projections for this year—which included a preliminary reaction to the May CPI data—were little changed, on balance, from the inflation forecast at the time of the previous meeting."
" The inflation forecast was higher, however, than at the time of the March meeting and the March Summary of _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of June 11–12, 2024Page 5Economic Projections (SEP) submissions."
" Inflation was still expected to decline further in 2025 and 2026, as demand and supply in product and labor markets continued to move into be tter balance; by 2026, total and core PCE price inflation were expected to be close to 2 percent."
" Risks to the inflation forecast were seen as tilted to the upside, reflecting the possibility that more persistent inflation dynamics or supplyside disruptions could unexpectedly materialize."
" The risks around the forecast for economic activity were seen as skewed to the downside on the grounds that morepersistent inflation could result in tighter financial conditions than in the staff’s baseline projection; in addition, deteriorating household financial positions, especially for lowerincome households, might prove to have a larger negative effect on economic activity than the staff anticipated."
"  Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2024 through 2026 and over the longer run."
" These projections were based on their individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy, including their projections of the federal funds rate."
 The longerrun projections represented each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable would tend to converge under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy.
"In their discussion of inflation developments, participants noted that after a significant decline in inflation during the second half of 2023, the early part of this year had seen a lack of further progress toward the Committee’s 2 percent objective."
" Participants judged that although inflation remained elevated, there had been modest further progress toward th e 2 percent goal in recent months."
" Participants observed that some of this progress was evident in the smaller monthly change in the core PCE price index and a lower trimmed mean inflation rate for April, with the May CPI reading providing additional evidence."
" Some participants commented that sustained achievement of the 2 percent inflation objective would be aided by lower overall services price inflation, and some noted that shelter price inflation had so far been slow to come down."
" In particular, a few participants emphasized that nominal wage growth, though still above rates consistent with price stability, had declined, notably in laborintensive sectors."
"Participants suggested that evidence of firms’ reduced pricing power reflected increased customer resistance to price increases, slower growth in economic activity, and a reassessment by businesses  of prospective economic conditions."
"With regard to the outlook for inflation, participants emphasized that they were strongly committed to their 2 percent objective and that they remained concerned that elevated inflation contin ued to harm the purchasing power of households, especially those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation."
 Participants highlighted a variety of factors that were likely to help contribute to continued disinflation in the period ahead.
"  The factors included continued easing of demand–supply pressures in product and labor markets, lagged eff ects on wages and prices of past monetary policy tightening, the delayed response of measured shelter prices to rental market developments, or the prospect of additional supplyside improvements."
The latter prospect included the possibility of a boost to productivity associated with businesses’ deployment of artificial intelligence–related technology.
 Participants observed that longerterm inflation expectations had remained well anchored and viewed this anchoring as underpinning the disinflation process.
 Participants affirmed that additional favorable data were required to give them greater confidence that inflation was moving sustainably toward 2 percent.
Participants remarked that demand and supply in the labor market had continued to come into better balance.
" These included a declining job openings rate, a lower quits rate, increases in parttime employment for economic reasons, a lower hiring rate, a further stepdown in the ratio of job vacancies to unemployed workers, and a gradual uptick in the unemployment rate."
" In considering recent payrolls data, some participants observed that, although increases in payrolls had continued to be strong, the monthly increase in employment consistent with labor market equilibrium might now be higher than in the past because of immigration."
" Several participants remarked that a variety of indi cators, including wage gains for job switchers, suggested that nominal wage growth was slowing, consistent with easing labor market pressures."
" A number of participants noted that, although the labor market remained strong, the ratio of vacancies to unemployment had returned to prepandemic levels and there was some risk that furt her cooling in labor market conditions could be associated with an increased pace of layoffs."
" Participants generally observed that continued labor market strength could be consistent with the Committee achieving both its employment and inflation goals, though they noted that some further gradual cooling in the labor market may be required."
  Participants noted that recent indicators suggested that economic activity had continued to expand at a solid pace.
" Participants expected that real GDP growth this year would be below the str ong pace recorded in 2023, and they remarked that recent data on economic activity were largely consistent with the anticipated slowing."
Participants observed that a lower rate of output growth this year could aid the disinflation process while also being consistent with a strong labor market.
 Participants generally viewed the Committee’s restrictive monetary policy stance as having a restraining effect on growth in consumption and investment spending and as contributing to a gradual slowing in the pace of economic activity.
Participants continued to assess that the risks to achieving their employment and inflation goals had moved toward better balance over the past year.
" Participants cited a number of downside risks to economic activity, including those associated with a sharperthan-anticipated slowing in aggregate demand alongside a marked deterioration in labor market cond itions, or with strains on lowerand moderateincome households’ budgets leading to an abrupt curtailment of consumer spending."
 A few participants pointed to downside risks to economic activity associated with the fragility of some parts of the CRE sector or the vulnerable balance sheet positions of some banks.
 Some participants highlighted reasons why inflation could remain above 2 percent for longer than expected.
" These participants pointed to risks that inflation could stay elevated as a result of worsening geopolitical developments, height ened trade tensions, more persistent shelter price inflation, financial conditions that might be or could become insufficiently restrictive, or U.S. fiscal policy becoming more expansionary than expected; the latter two scenarios were also seen as implying upside risks to econom ic activity."
 Several participants also cited the risk of an unanchoring of longerterm inflation expectations.
"In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, participants observed that incoming data indicated continued solid growth in economic activity and a strong labor market while also pointing to modest further progress toward the Committee’s 2 percent inflation objective in recent months."
 Part icipants remained highly attentive to inflation risks.
" All participants judged that, in light of current economic conditions and their implications for the outlook for employment and inflation, as well as the balance of risks, it was appropriate to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5¼ to 5½ percent."
"_____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of June 11–12, 2024Page 7In discussing the outlook for monetary policy, participants noted that progress in reducing inflation had been slower this year than they had expected last December."
They emphasized that they did not expect that it would be appropriate to lower the target range for the federal funds rate until additional information had emerged to give them greater confidence that inflation was moving sustainably toward the Commit tee’s 2 percent objective.
" Some participants suggested that further clarity about the FOMC’s reaction function might be provided by communications that emphasized the Committee’s datadependent approach, with monetary policy decisions being conditional on the evolution of the economy rather than being on a preset path."
"  In discussing riskmanagement considerations that could bear on the outlook for monetary policy, participants assessed that, with labor  market tightness having eased and inflation having declined over the past year, the risks to achieving the Committee’s employment and inflation goals had moved toward better balance, leaving monetary policy well positioned to deal with the risks and uncertainties faced in pu rsuing both sides of the Committee’s dual mandate."
" Th e vast majority of participants assessed that growth in economic activity appeared to be gradually coolin g, and most participants remarked that they viewed the current policy stance as restrictive."
" Some remarked that the continued strength of the economy, as well as other factors, could mean that the longerrun equilibrium interest  rate was high er than previously assessed, in which case both the stance of monetary policy and overall financial conditions may be less restrictive than they might appear."
 A couple of participants noted that the longerrun  equilibrium interest rate was a better guide for determining where the federal funds rate may need to move  over the longer run than for assessing the restrictiveness of current policy.
 Some participants emphasized the need for patience in allowing the Committee’s restrictive policy stance to restrain aggregate demand and further moderate inflation pressures.
" Several participants observed that, were inflation to persist at an elevated level or to increase further, the target range for the federal funds rate might need to be raised."
 A number of participants remarked that monetary policy should stand ready to respond to unexpected economic weakness.
" Several participants specifically emphasized that with the labor market normalizing, a further weakening of demand may now generate a larger unemployment response than in the recent past when lower demand for labor was felt relatively more through fewer job openings."
