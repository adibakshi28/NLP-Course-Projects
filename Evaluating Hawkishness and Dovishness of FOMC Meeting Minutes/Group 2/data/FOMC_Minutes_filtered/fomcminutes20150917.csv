" Daily takeup in the Desk’s overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations declined somewhat, apart from month -ends, likely reflecting some increase in money market interest rates."
" However, if substantial adverse shocks occurred , continuing reinvestment until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate was well under way could help avoid situations that would warrant a larger reduction in the federal funds rate than perhaps could be accomplished given the constraint posed by the effective lower bound to nominal interest rates."
" At the same time, it was also highlighted that a larger balance sheet could entail costs, and that the Principles and Plans indicate that, in the longer run, the SOMA portfolio should be no larger than necPage 2Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________essary to conduct monetary policy efficiently and effectively."
 Consumer price inflation remained below the Committee’s longer -run objective of 2 percent and was restrained by further declines in energy prices and non -energy import prices.
" Survey measures of longer -run inflation expectatio ns remained stable, while market -based measures of inflation compensation moved lower."
 Total nonfarm payroll employment expanded at a solid pace in July and August.
 The unemployment rate stayed at 5.3 percent in July but fell to 5.1 percent in August.
" With the labor force participation rate unchanged over this period, the employmentto-population ratio edged up."
 Household spending was supported by moderate growth in real disposable income in July and a wealth -toincome ratio that remained high even after recent declines in equity values.
 The U.S. international trade deficit widened in June before narrowing substantially in July.
" Measures of expected longer -run inflation from a variety of surveys, including the Michigan survey, Minutes of the Meeting of September 1617, 2015Page 3_____________________________________________________________________________________________the Survey of Professional Forecasters, and the Desk’s Survey of  Primary Dealers, remained stable."
" However, market -based measures of inflation compensation fell to near their historical lows , reportedly  in response to the recent appreciation of the dollar, the decline in oil prices, and readings on realized inflation that were slightly below market expectations."
" Over the four quarters ending in the second quarter, the employment cost index increased nearly 2 percent and compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector rose 2¼ percent."
" Foreign eco nomic growth remained weak in the second quarter, held back by contractions in real GDP in Canada, Japan, Brazil, and Taiwan, even as activity continued to expand at a moderate pace in the euro area and the United Kingdom."
" Indicators for the third quarter  pointed to a slight pickup in the pace of foreign growth, particularly as recent data for Canada suggested that some of the firsthalf weakness there was dissipating."
" Inflation rates continued to be quite low in the advanced foreign economies, and market -based measures of inflation compensation had recently moved down in the euro area and Japan."
" In contrast, inflation in the emerging market economies had risen in recent months as a result of higher food prices and widespread currency depreciation."
"Staff Review of the Financial Situation  Although U.S. economic data releases generally met market expectations, domestic financial conditions tightened modestly as concerns a bout prospects for  global economic growth, centered  on China, prompted an increase in financial market volatility and a deterioration in risk sentiment during the intermeeting period."
" Over the intermeeting period, t he concerns about global economic growth and turbulence in financial markets  led to greater uncertainty among market participants about  the likely timing of  the start of the normalization of the stance of U.S. monetary policy."
 Measu res of inflation compensation based on Treasury Inflation -Protected Securities fell to near their historical lows.
" Alt hough concerns about global economic  growth likely contributed to the declines in domestic equity prices, investors may also have reassessed valuations and risk in equity markets."
 The growth of commercial and industrial loans on banks’ books slowed in July and August; the deceleration was concentrated in Page 4Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________banks with greater exposures to oil and gas firms.
" Conditions in the market for residential mortgages continued to improve slowly , with interest rates on 30year fixed -rate mortgages declining slightly."
" In contrast, falling commodity prices and concerns about the pace of global growth contributed to capital outflows and generally wider spreads on dollar -denominated debt in emerging Asia and Latin America."
" Recent information on real U.S. economic activity was generally stronger than expected, but equity prices declined, the foreign exchange v alue of the dollar appreciated further, and indicators of foreign economic growth were generally weak."
 The staff left its forecast for real GDP growth over the second half of the year little changed but lowered its projection for economic growth over the next several years.
 The staff also further trimmed its assumptions for the rates of increase in productivity and potential output over the medium term.
 The unemployment rate was projected to run a little below the staff’s estimate of its longer -run natural rate over this period.
 The staff projected that consumer price inflation would move down over the near term by more than in the previous projection.
" With energy prices and non -oil import prices expected to begin to increase steadily next year, the staff projected that inflation would rise gradually over the next several years but would still be slightly below the Committee’s longer -run objective of 2 percent at the end of 2018."
" Inflation was anticipated to move up to 2 percent thereafter, with inflation expectations in the longer run assumed to be consistent with the Committee’s objective and slack in labor  and product markets projected to have waned."
" The staff viewed the uncertainty around its September projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as similar to the average of the past 20 years."
" The risks to the forecast for real GD P and inflation were seen as tilted to the downside, reflecting the staff’s assessment that neither monetary nor fiscal policy was well positioned to help the economy withstand substantial adverse shocks."
" Consistent with this downside risk to aggregate de mand and with the further adjustments to the staff’s supply -side assumptions, the staff viewed the risks to its outlook for the unemployment rate as tilted to the upside."
" Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook  In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, members of the Board of Governors and Federal Reserve Bank presidents submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, inflation, and the federal funds rate for each year from Minutes of the Meeting of September 1617, 2015Page 5_____________________________________________________________________________________________2015 thr ough 2018 and over the longer run, conditional on each participant’s judgment of appropriate monetary policy."
" The longer -run projections represent each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, u nder appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy."
" In their discussion of the economic  situation and the outlook, meeting participants viewed the information received over the intermeeting period as indicating that economic activity was  expanding moderately."
"  The labor market continued to improve, with solid job gains and declining unemployment, and  labor market indicators showed that underutilization of labor resources had dimini shed since early in the year."
" Growth in real GDP over the first half of the year was stronger than participants expected when they prepared their June forecasts , and the unemployment rate declined somewhat more than anticipated."
 P articipants made only sma ll adjustments to their projections for economic activity over the medium term.
" Most continued to see the risks to real activity and unemployment as nearly balanced, but many acknowledged that recent global economic and financial developments may have increased the  downside risks  to economic activity  somewhat ."
"Inflation continued to run below the Committee’s longer -run objective , partly reflecting declines in energy prices and in prices of non -energy imports."
 Market -based measures of inflation compensation moved lower; survey measures of longer -term inflation expectations remained stable.
"  Participants anticipated that recent global developments would likely put further downward pressure on inflation in the near term; compared with their previous forecasts, more now  saw the risks to inflation as tilted to the downside."
" B ut participants still expected that, as the labor market continued to improve and the transitory effects of declines in energy and  nonoil import prices dissipated, inflation  would  rise gradually toward 2  percent over the medium term."
" Participants noted that ongoing gains in employment and real income  were providing support for the rise in spending, and this  support was expected to continue going forward ."
" Contacts  were generally optimistic about the outlook, although retail sales appeared to be softening in a few areas where economic activity was adversely affected by declines in the energy sector and the increase i n the foreign exchange value of  the dollar."
  Solid gains in employment and favorable mortgage rates were anticipated to continue to underpin the recovery in housing .
" Multifamily construction was particularly strong in a couple of Districts, but in another a shortage of lots was constraining builders’ ability to meet strong demand for new single -family homes."
 Payroll employment had been increasing steadily.
" Underutilization of labor resources had diminished along a number of dimensions:  The unemployment rate  had fallen to a level Page 6Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________close to most participants’ estimates of its longer -run normal rate, and the numbers of discouraged workers and those employed part time for economic reasons had moved lower."
 B ut some others believed that labor market slack in addition to that measured by the unemployment rate remain ed and that further progress  was possible before labor market conditions were fully consistent with the Committee’s objective of maximum employment.
"  A number of participants  noted that eliminating slack along such broader dimensions might require a temporary decline in the unemployment rate below its longer -run normal level, and that this development could speed the return of inflation to 2 percent."
" The incoming information on wages and labor compensation, including a n especially  low reading on the employment cost index for the second quarter, showed no broad -based acceleration ."
" To some, the continued subdued trend in wages was evidence of an absence of upward pressure on inflation from current levels of labor utilization."
" Several others, however,  noted that weak productivity growth and low price inflation might be contributing t o modest wage increases ."
 Recent readings on headline consumer price inflation reflected only small increases in core inflation and renewed weakness in consumer energy prices.
" Still, almost all participants anticipated that inflation would continue to run below 2  percent in the near term, particularly in light of the further decline in oil prices and further appreciation of the dollar over the intermeeting period."
 Participants also discussed various measures of  expect ations for  inflation over the longer  run.
" Surveys continued to show stable longer -run inflation expectations, and most participants continued to anticipate that longer -run inflation expectations would remain  well anchored."
 A few participants expressed some concern about the decline in market -based measures of inflation compensation.
Participants discussed the potential implications of recent economic and financial developments abroad for U.S. economic activity and inflation.
  A material slowdown in economic growth  in China and potential adverse spillovers to other economies  were likely to depress U.S. net exports to some extent.
" In addition, concerns associated with developments in China and other emerging market economies had contributed to a further appreciation of the dollar and declines in prices of oil and other commodities , which were likely to hold down  U.S. consumer price  inflation  in the near term ."
"  Many participants judged that the effects of these developments on domestic economic activity were likely to be small, but they acknowledged the risk that they might restrain U.S. economic growth somewhat ."
" During their discussion of economic conditions and monetary policy, participants indicated that they did not see the change s in asset prices  during the intermeeting period as bearing significantly on their policy choice except insofar as they  affected the outlook for  achieving the Committee’s macroeconomic objectives  and the risks associated with that outlook ."
 Many of them saw the likely effects of recent developments on the path of economic activity and inflation as small or transitory.
" Most participants continued to anticipate that, based on Minutes of the Meeting of September 1617, 2015Page 7_____________________________________________________________________________________________their assessment of current economic conditions and their outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, the conditions for policy firming had been met or would likely be met by the end of the year."
" However, some participants  judged that the downside risks to the outlook for economic growth and inflation had  increased."
" In their view , although  the time for policy normalization might be near, it would be appropriate to wait for information, including evidence of further improvement in the labor market,  confirming  that the outlook for economic growth had not deteriorated  significantly and that inflation was still on a path to return to 2 percent over the medium term."
" A few mentio ned that a pickup in wage increases could bolster their confidence that resource  utilization had tightened sufficiently to  help move inflation  toward the Committee’s objective , but they did not view an acceleration in wages  as a necessary condition for gaining such confidence ."
 S ome participants were concerned  that the downside risks to inflation could be realized if the target range for the federal funds rate was increased before  it was clear that economic growth would remain  at an abovetrend pace  and downward pressures on inflation  had abated .
 They also worried that such a premature tightening might erode the credibility of the Committee’s inflation objectiv e if inflation stayed  at a rate below 2 percent for a prolonged period .
" It was noted that monetary policy was better positioned to respond effectively to unanticipated upside inflation surprises than to persistent below -objective  inflation , particularly when the federal funds rate was still near its effective lower bound ."
" For example, a significant  delay risked a n undesired buildup of inflationary pressures  or economic and financial imbalances that would be costly t o unwind and that eventually  could have adverse consequences for economic growth."
" In addition, a prompt decision to firm policy could  provide a signal of confidence in the strength of the U.S. economy  that might spur rather than restrain economic activity."
"Committee Policy Action  In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that information received since the FOMC met in July indicated that economic activity was expanding at a moderate pace ."
" Although net exports remained soft, economic growth was broadly based."
 Members  noted that  recent global and financial market developments might restrain economic activity somewhat as a result of the higher level of the dollar and possible effects of  slower economic growth in China and in a number of emerging market and commodity - producing economies.
" Nevertheless, the y still viewed the risks to U.S. economic activity as nearly balanced , and they continued to expect that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity would most likely continue to expand at a moderate pace."
"Members agreed  that labor market conditions had improved considerably since earlier in the year, with ongoing solid gains in payroll employment and the unemployment rate fall ing to  a level quite close to their estimates of its longer -run normal rate."
 M embers anticipated that economic activity  was likely  to continue to expand at a pace sufficient to lead to a further reduction in underutilization of labor resources.
" Headline inflation continued to be held down by the effects of declines in energy and commodity prices, and the year -overyear increase in core PCE inflation remained below the Committee’s objective."
 Survey -based measures of longer -term inflation expectations had remained stable ; market -based measures of inflation compensation had moved lower .
 Members anticipated that the declines in oil prices and the appreciation of the dollar over the intermeeting period were likely to exert some additional downward pressure on inflation  in the near term .
" Members expected inflation to rise gradually toward  2 percent over the medium term as the labor market improved further and the transitory effects of declines in energy and import prices dissipated , but they agreed to continue to monitor inflation developments closely."
" But some indicated that their confidence that inflation would gradually return to the Committee’s 2 percent objective over the medium term had not increased , in large part  because recent global economic and financial developments had imparted some restraint to the economic outlook  and placed further downward pressure on inflation  in the near term ."
" Most m embers agreed Page 8Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________that their confidence that inflation would move  to the Committee’s  inflation objective would increase if , as expected, economic activity continued to expand at a moderate rate and labor market conditions  improved further ."
" Many expected those conditions to be met later this year , although several members were concerned about downside risks to the outlook for real activity and inflation ."
"Other factors  important to the Committee’s assessment of the inflation outlook were the expectation that the influences of lower energy and commodity prices on headline inflation would abate, as had occurred in previous episodes,  and that inflation expectations would r emain stable."
" With energy and commodity prices expected to stabilize, m embers ’ projections of inflation incorporated a step -up in headline inflation next year ."
" However, several m embers  saw a risk that the additional downward pressure on inflation from lower oil prices and a higher foreign exchange value of the dollar could persist  and, as a result,  delay or diminish  the expected upturn in inflation."
" And, while survey measures of longer -run inflation expectations remained stable, a couple of member s expressed unease with  the decline in  market -based measures of inflation compensation over the intermeeting period ."
"After assessing the outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation and weighing the uncertainties associated with the outlook, all but one member concluded that, although the U.S. economy had strengthened and labor underutilization had diminished, economic conditions did not warrant an increase in the target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting ."
" Nevertheless , in part because of the risks to  the outlook for economic activity and inflation,  the Committee decided that it was prudent to wait for additional information c onfirm ing that  the economic outlook had not deteriorated and bolster ing members’ confidence that inflation would gradually move up to ward  2 percent over the medium term."
"  One member, however, preferred to raise the target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting, indicating that the current low level of real interest rates was not appropriate in the context of current economic conditions ."
The Committee agreed to mai ntain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and to reaffirm in its postmeeting statement that the Committee ’s decision about how long to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate would  depend on its assessment of actual and expected progress toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.
" Members agreed that t he Committee’s  evaluation of progress on its objectives would  take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor  market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
 The y also agreed to indicate that the Committee continued to  anticipate that it would  be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate when it  sees some further improvement in the labor market and is reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term.
"  It was noted that the expected path of the federal funds rate, rather than the exact timing of the initial increase , was most important in influencing financial conditions and thus the outlook for the economy and inflation."
" The Committee reiterated its expectation that, even after employment and inflation are near mandateconsistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run."
" At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  “Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster maximum employment and price stability."
 The System Open Market Account manager and the secretary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the System’s balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the Committee’s objectives of maximum employment and price stability.”  The vote encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p.m.:  “Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in July suggests that economic activity is expanding at a moderate pace.
" The labor market continued to improve, with solid job gains and declining unemployment."
" Inflation has continued to run below the Committee’s longer -run objective, partly reflecting declines in energy prices and in prices of non -energy imports."
 Marketbased measures of inflation compensation moved lower; surveybased measures of longer -term inflation expectations have remained stable.
"Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
 Recent global economic and financial developments may restrain economic activity somewhat and are likely to put further downward pressure on inflation in the near term.
" Nonetheless, the Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, with labor market indicators continuing to move toward  levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate."
 The Committee continues to see the risks to the outlook for economic activity and the labor market as nearly balanced but is monitoring developments abroad.
 Inflation is anticipated to remain near its recent low level in the near term but the Committee expects inflation to rise gradually toward 2  percent over the medium term as the labor market improves further and the transitory effects of declines in energy and import prices dissipate.
 The Committee continues to monitor inflation developments closely.
" To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee today reaffirmed its view that the current 0 to ¼  percent target range for the federal funds rate remains appropriate."
" In determining how long to maintain this target range, the Committee will assess progress —both realized and expected —toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2  percent inflation."
" This assessment will take into account a wide range  of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
 The Committee anticipates that it will be appropriate to raise the targ et range for the federal funds rate when it has seen some further improvement in the labor market and is reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2  percent objective over the medium term.
" When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer -run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent."
" The Committee currently anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near mandateconsistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee  views as normal in the longer run.”  Voting for this action:  Janet L."
Mr. Lacker dissented because he believed that maintaining exceptionally low real interest rates was not appropriate for an economy with persistently strong consumption growth and tightening labor markets.
" He viewed current disinflationa ry forces as likely to be transitory, and was reasonably confident that inflation would move toward 2 percent."
" In his view, further delay in removing monetary policy accommodation would represent a risky departure from past patterns of FOMC behavior in response to such economic conditions."
"Madigan  Secretary   Minutes of the Meeting of September 1617, 2015Page 11_____________________________________________________________________________________________Summary of Economic Projections  In conjunction with the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting held on September 16 –17, 2015, meeting participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real output growth, the unemployment rate, inflation, and the federal funds rate for each year from 2015 to 2018 and over the longer run."
 Each participant’s projection was based on information available at the time of the meeting together with his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy and assumptions about the factors likely to affect economic outcomes.
"  The longerrun projections represent each participant’s assessment of the value to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy."
  “Appropriate monetary policy” is defined as the future path of policy that each participant deems most likely to foster outcomes for economic activity and inflation that best satisfy his or her individual interpretation of the Federal Reserve’s objectives of maximum employment and stable prices.
"FOMC participants generally expected that , under appropriate monetary policy, economic growth in 2015 would be at or slightly above their individual estimates of the U.S. economy’s longer -run normal growth rate and would increase somewhat in 2016 before slowing to or toward its longerrun rate in 2017 and 2018 (table 1 and figure 1)."
 Most participants projected that the unemployment rate would decline a bit further over the remainder of 2015 and be at or slightly below their individual judgments of its longerrun normal level from 2016 through 2018.
"  Participants projected that  inflation, as measured by the fourquarter change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) , would be very low this year but then would pick up notably next year and rise further in 2017; all participants project ed that inflation would be at or close to the Committee’s 2 percent longer -run objective in 2018."
"  Most expected that it would be appropriate to raise the target federal funds rate fairly gradually over the projection period as headwinds to economic growth fade, labor market indicators reach levels consistent with the Committee ’s mandated objective of maximum employment, and inflation moves up to 2 percent."
Most participants viewed the levels of uncertainty associated with their outlooks for economic growth and the unemployment rate as broadly similar to the average level of the past 20 years.
"  Most also judged the level of uncertainty about inflation to be broadly similar to the average level of the past 20 years, although a few participants viewed it as higher."
" In addition, most participants continued to see the risks to the outlook for economic growth and for the unemployment rate as broadly balanced, although some viewed the risks to economic growth as weighted to the downside and some saw the risks to unemployment as weighted to the upside ."
" A few more participants saw the risks to inflation as weighted to the downside than as balanced, while one judged these risks to be tilted to the upside."
"The Outlook for Economic Activity Participants generally projected that, conditional on their individual assumptions about appropriate monetary policy, real gross domestic product (GDP) would grow from 2015 through 2017 at a pace slightly above their estimates of its longerrun normal rate, a nd that real GDP growth would then slow in 2018 to a rate at or near their individual estimates of the longerrun rate."
"  Participants pointed to a number of factors that they expected would contribute to moderate real output growth over the next few years, including improving labor market conditions, strengthened household and business balance sheets, the boost to consumer spending from low energy prices, diminishing restraint from fiscal policy, and stillaccommodative monetary policy."
"Compared with their Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) contributions in June, all participants revised up their projections of real GDP growth for 2015, reflecting strongerthan-anticipated growth over the first half of the year ."
 Most participants revised down their projections of real GDP growth in 2016 and 2017.
  Several participants cited slower projected productivity growth as a reason for their downward revisions.
" The median value of participants’ current projections for real GDP growth was 2.1 percent in 2015 , 2.3 percent in 2016, 2.2 percent in 2017, and 2.0 percent in 2018."
"  Although about half of the participants marked down their projections of real GDP growth in the longer run, the median remained at 2.0 percent."
Most participants projected that the unemployment rate would decline a bit further over the remainder of 2015 Page 1_____________________________________________________________________________________________Table 1.

 The median of participants’ forecasts for the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of each year was 5.0 percent in 2015 and 4.8 percent from 2016 through 2018 .
" Compared with the June SEP, participants’ projected paths for the unemployment rate generally shifted down somewhat through 2017."
 Many participants noted that recent data pointing to fasterthan-expected improvement in labor market conditions were an important factor underlying the downward revisions to their unemployment rate forecasts.
" All but a few participants revised down their estimates of the longerrun normal rate of unemployment; as a result, the median estimate edged down to 4.9 percent."
 Several participants noted that stillsub-dued wage and price inflation despite the strongerthan-expected momentum in the labor market suggested a lower level of the longerrun normal rate of unemployment than they had thought previously.
 A few also mentioned research indicating that demographic groups with lower average unemployment rates have accounted for an increasing fraction of the labor force.
Figures 3.A and 3.B show the distribution of participants’ views regarding the likely outcomes for real GD P growth and the unemployment rate through 2018 and in the longer run.
" The diversity of views across participants reflected, in part, their individual assessments of a number of factors, including the effects of lower oil prices on consumer spending and business investment, the extent to which dollar appreciation and weaker foreign economic growth would affect real activity, the rate at which the forces that have been restraining the pace of the economic expansion would continue to abate, the degree to which ongoing improvements in the labor market would support stronger consumption growth, and the appropriate path of monetary policy."
" Relative to the June SEP, the dispersion of participants’ projections for real GDP growth was roughly unchanged through 2016 but was somewhat wider in 2017 and the longer run."
  The dispersion of participants’ projections for the unemployment rate in the longer run also widened somewhat.
"The Outlook for Inflation Compared with the June SEP, almost all participants marked down their projections for PCE inflation this year, noting that inflation had been running below their earlier projections and that further declines in energy prices and import prices were putting additional temporary downward pressure on PCE inflation."
" Nearly all participants saw PCE inflation picking up in 2016 and rising further in 2017, and almost all saw inflation at or close to the Committee’s 2 percen t longerrun objective in 2018."
" Some participants also marked down their projections for core PCE inflation from 2015 through 2017 , although almost all still expected core inflation to rise gradually over the projection period and to reach a level at or near 2 percent in 2018."
" The median values of projections for PCE inflation were 0.4 percent in 2015, 1.7 percent in 2016, 1.9 percent in 2017, and 2.0 percent in 2018, and the median values for core PCE inflation were 1.4 percent in 2015, 1.7 percent in 2016, 1.9 percent in 2017, and 2.0 percent in 2018 ."
" Factors cited by participants as likely to contribute to a rise of inflation toward 2 percent included stable longerterm inflation expectations, tighter resource utilization, a pickup in wage growth, the waning effects of declines in energy prices and appreciation of the dollar, and stillaccommodative monetary policy."
Figures 3.C and 3.D provide information on the distribution of participants’ views about the outlook for inflation.
" The range of participants’ projections for PCE inflation in 2015 widened slightly compared with June, reflecting in part differences in participants’ assessments of the effects of the declines in energy and import prices on the outlook for inflation."
 The dispersion for PCE inflation for 2016 and 2017 was about unchanged.
" Similarly, the ranges for core PCE inflation widened slightly in 2015 and were unchanged for 2016 and 2017."
 The distributions for both inflation measures in 2017 and 2018 were notably more concentrated near the Committee’s 2 percent longer -run objective than those for 2015 and 2016.
Appropriate Monetary Policy Participants judged that it would be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate over the projection period as forces that have been restraining the expansion abate and as labor market indicators and inflation move toward values the Committee judges consistent with the attainment of its mandated objectives of maximum employment and price stability.
"Most participants projected that the unemployment rate would be at or only slightly above their estimates of its longerrun normal level at the end of the year in which Summary of Economic Projections of the Meeting of September 1617, 2015Page 5_____________________________________________________________________________________________Figure 3.A.

"  All participants projected that inflation would be below the Committee’s 2 percent objective in that year, but they also saw inflation rising substantially closer to 2 percent in the following year."
Almost al l participants judged that it would be appropriate for the federal funds rate to remain noticeably below its longerrun normal level over the next two years even though the unemployment rate was anticipated to be near its mandateconsistent level and most participants expect ed inflation to be close to 2 percent by 2017.
" The reasons cited for only gradually increasing the federal funds rate included an assessment that the headwinds that have been holding back the economic expansion will continue to exert some restraint on economic activity, partly because weak activity abroad and the recent appreciation of the dollar are likely to continue to damp U.S. net exports for some time."
" As support for a view that accommodative monetary policy would remain appropriate over the next few years, some participants also noted their assessment that residual slack in the labor market will still be evident in measures of labor utilization other than the unemployment rate, or  that the risks to the economic outlook are asymmetric as a result of the constraints on monetary policy associated with the effective lower bound on the federal funds rate."
"Relative to the June SEP, more than half of the participants revised down their estimates of the longerrun level of the federal funds rate, with a lower assessment                                                  1 Table 2 provides estimates of the forecast uncertainty for the change in real GDP, the unemployment rate, and total consumer price inflation over the period from 1995 through 2014."
 of the economy’s longer -run growth potential generally cited as a contributing factor.
"  All participants judged that inflation in the longer run would be equal to the Committee’s objective of 2 percent, impl ying that their individual judgments regarding the appropriate longerrun level of the real federal funds rate in the absence of further shocks to the economy ranged from 1.0 to 2.0 percent."
"Participants’ views of the appropriate path for monetary policy were informed by their judgments about the state of the economy, including the values of the unemployment rate and other labor market indicators that would be consistent with maximum employment, their estimates of the current extent of slack in the labor market , the prospects for inflation to return to the Committee’s longerterm objective of 2 percent, the implications of international developments for the domestic economy, the pace at which headwinds that have been restraining economic activity dissipate and underlying momentum in the economy strengthens, the desire to minimize potential disruptions in financial markets that could result from a steep increase in the target federal funds rate following liftoff, and the risks around the outlook for economic activity and inflation."
  Some participants also mentioned the prescriptions of various monetary policy rules as factors they considered in judging the appropriate path for the federal funds rate.
"Uncertainty and Risks Nearly all participants continued to judge the levels of uncertainty attending their projections for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate as broadly similar to the norms during the previous 20 years (figure 4).1  Most participants continued to see the risks to their outlooks for real GDP growth as broadly balanced, although a larger number than in June viewed the risks to real GDP growth as weighted to the downside."

"  Most participants judged the risks to the outlook for the unemployment rate to be broadly balanced, though more participants than in June viewed the risks to the unemployment rate as weighted to the upside."
"As in the June SEP, participants generally agreed that the levels of uncertainty associated with their inflation forecasts were broadly similar to historical norms."
  Many participants viewed the risks to their inflation forecast as balanced.
 These participants cited the recent declines in marketbased measures of inflation compensation and commodity prices and the appreciation of the dollar as factors that could place greater downward pressure on prices than anticipated.

"  As described in the box “Forecast Uncertainty,” under certain assumptions, there is about a 70 percent probability that actual outcomes for real GDP, unemployment, and consumer prices will be in ranges implied by the average size of projection errors made in the past."
" Summary of Economic Projections of the Meeting of September 1617, 2015Page 13_____________________________________________________________________________________________        Forecast Uncertainty     The economic projections provided by the members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks inform discussions of monetary policy among policymakers and can aid public understanding of the basis for policy actions."
" Thus, in setting the stance of monetary policy, participants consider not only what appears to be the most likely economic outcome as embodied in their projections, but also the range  of alternative possibilities, the likelihood of their occurring, and the potential costs to the economy should they occur."
"Table 2 summarizes the average historical accuracy of a range of forecasts, including those reported in past Monetary Policy Report s and those prepared by the Federal Reserve Board’s staff in advance of meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee."
" The corresponding 70  percent confidence intervals for overall inflation would be 1.2  to 2.8  percent in the current year, 1.0  to 3.0  percent in the second year, 0.9  to 3.1  percent in the third year, and 1.0 to 3.0  percent in the fourth year."
" As with real activity and inflation, the outlook for the future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable uncertainty."
 This uncertainty arises primarily because each participant’s assessment of the appropriate stance of monetary policy depends importantly on the evolution of real activity and inflation over time.
