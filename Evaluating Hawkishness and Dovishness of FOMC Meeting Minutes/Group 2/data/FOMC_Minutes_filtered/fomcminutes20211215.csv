" Financial markets responded to significant new information about the economy and monetary policy, as well as the emergence of the Omicron variant."
  Expectations for an earlier reduction in Federal Reserve policy accommodation lifted shortterm interest rates an d supported the dollar.
" In addition to the effects of the pandemic on risk sentiment, some discu ssed the potential for COVID to become endemic, possibly resulting in modestly lower potential growth over time and a lower longrun neutral level of the federal funds rate."
"monetary policy, expectations for a reduction in policy accommodation shifted forward notably."
"  Although the Desk surveys and interest rate futures indicated expectations for earlier increases in the target range than at the time of the November meeting, expectations for the federal funds rate at longer horizons did not appear to have risen."
Discussion of Policy Normal ization Considerations Participants began a discussion of a range of topics associated with the eventual no rmalization of the stance of monetary policy.
" In particular, they noted that the principles and plans underlying policy normalization were communicated in advance of any decisions or actions, which enhanced the public’s understanding and thus the effectiveness of monetary policy during that period."
" Participants generally emphasized that, as in the previous normalization episode and as expressed in the Committee’s Statement on LongerRun Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, changes in the target range for the federal funds rate should be the Committee’s primary means for adjusting the stance of monetary policy in support of its maximumemployment and pricestability objectives."
" A few participants also noted that when the federal funds rate is away from the effective lower bound (ELB), the Committee could more nimbly ch ange interest rate policy than balance sheet policy in response to economic conditions."
" Most notably, participants remarked  that the current economic outlook was much stronger, with higher inflation and a tighter labor market than at the beginning of the previous normalization episode."
" Participants also judged the Federal Reserve to be better positioned for normalization than in the past, as the amplereserves framework and the Federal Reserve’s current interest rate control tools, including interest on reserve balances and the overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) facility, are in place and working well."
" They noted that current conditions included a stronger economic outlook, higher inflation, and a larger balance sheet and thus could warrant a potentially faster pace of policy rate normalization."
   Participants discussed considerations regarding the longerrun size of the balance sheet consistent with the efficient and effective implementation of monetary policy in an amplereserves regime.
" Several participants noted that the level of reserves that would ultimately be needed to implement monetary policy effectively is uncertain, because the underlying demand for reserves by banks is time varying."
" In light of this uncertainty and the Committee’s previous experience, a couple of participants expressed a preference to allow for a substantial buffer level of reserves to support interest rate control."
" Some participants expressed the view that the SRF would help ensure interest rate control as the size of the balance sheet approached its longerrun le vel; several participants noted that the SRF could fac ilitate a faster runoff of the balance sheet than might otherwise be the case; several participants raised the possi bility that the establishment of the SRF could reduce the demand for reserves in the longer run, suggesting that the longerrun balance sheet could be smaller than otherwise."
  Staff Review of the Economic Situation  The information available at the time of the December 14–15 meeting suggested that U.S. real GDP growth was picking up in the fourth quarter after having slowed in the third quarter.
 Consumer price inflation through October—as measured by the 12month percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE)—remained elevated.
"Total nonfarm payroll employment rose solidly, on average, in October and November, but the average gain was below that seen in recent quarters."
" The unemployment rate declined from 4.8 percent in September to 4.2 percent in November; the unemployment rates for African Americans and Hispanics also declined substantially over this period, but both rates remained well above the national average."
 The labor force participation rate and the employmentto-population ratio both moved up in November.
 The fourweek moving average of initial claims for regular state unemployment insurance moved lower through early December and was at a level similar to that seen before the pandemic.
 Recent weekly estimates of privatesector payrolls constructed by the Board’s staff using data provided by the payroll processor ADP pointed to a further increase in private employment through early December.
"Inflation readings remained high, and various indicators suggested that inflationary pressures had broadened in recent months."
" Total PCE price inflation was 5.0 percent over the 12 months ending in October, and core PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in consumer energy prices and many consumer food prices, was 4.1 percent over the same period."
" The trimmed Minutes of the Meeting of December 14–15, 2021Page 5_____________________________________________________________________________________________mean measure of 12month PCE inflation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas was 2.6 percent in October, an increase of 0.6 percentage point relative to two months earlier."
" In November, the 12month change in the consumer price index (CPI) was 6.8 percent, while core CPI inflation was 4.9 percent over the same period."
" Surveybased measures of mediumand longerrun inflation expectations—including those from the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Survey of Consumer Expectations, and the Survey of Professional Forecasters—leveled off after having risen over the past year."
"Real PCE growth appeared to be picking up in the fourth quarter desp ite an upturn in COVID19 cases, the waning effect of previous fiscal stimulus measures, lingering supply bottlenecks, and recent increases in consumer prices."
" Housing demand remained strong, but indicators of housingsector activity, including housing starts and home sales, were generally little changed in October."
"Growth in business fixed investment appeared to be rising at a slow pace again in the fourth quarter, as supply bottlenecks continued to weigh on business equipment spending, and the limited ava ilability of construction materials was still holding back spending on nonresidential structures."
" However, growth in state and local government purchases appeared to be moderating, as payrolls decreased in October and November, and nominal state and local construction expenditures in October were only a little above their thirdquarter level."
"After reaching a record level in September, the U.S. international trade deficit narrowed in October, reflecting a large rebound in exports."
"Incoming data were consistent with a pickup in foreign economic growth in the current quarter, driven mainly by the reopening of Asian economies following lockdowns earlier in the year to contain a resurgence of COVID19 cases."
" In contrast, the introduction of new public health restrictions in Europe in response to a new wave of COVID19 infections appeared to have restrained economic activity in some European economies."
" Inflation abroad continued to rise, mostly driven by further increases in retail energy and food prices."
" Staff Review of the Financial Situation  Over the intermeeting period, rising inflation and FOMC communications appeared to have put substantial upward pressure on shorterdated Treasury yields."
 Pandemicrelated fears as well as concerns about inflation and tighter monetary policy apparently weighed on risky asset prices despite continued robust economic data.
"On net, inflation compensation had declined moderately since the November FOMC meeting, as heightened concerns about the inflation outlook appeared to be outweighed by increases in the perceived prospects for tighter monetary policy and by fears about the course of the pandemic."
" Renewed concerns about the course of the pandemic also contributed to a decline in the 10year Treasury yield, on net, over the intermeeting period despite strongerthan-anticipated data on economic activity and surprisingly high inflation."
"Broad equity indexes were little changed, on net, since the previous FOMC meeting, as strong economic data appeared to offset concerns  regarding monetary policy, inflation, and the pandemic."
The credit quality of large nonfinancial corporations remained solid amid strong earnings growth.
" Small business loan originations ticked down in October, likely reflecting weak loan Minutes of the Meeting of December 14–15, 2021Page 7_____________________________________________________________________________________________demand as su ggested by su rveybased and market indicators."
" Growth of credit card balances picked up in September and October, and bank credit data indicated a further increase in November."
 Growth of auto loans outstanding slowed through October because of tepid auto sales.
 Staff Economic Outlook  The projection for U.S. consumer price inflation prepared by the staff for the December FOMC meeting was higher than in the November projection.
 PCE price inflation was therefore expected to step down to 2.1 percent in 2022 and to remain there in 2023 and 2024.
" Projected inflation over this period was a little higher than in the previous projection, as supply bottleneck s were assumed to resolve more gradually and as the salience of this year’s higher inflation readings was assumed to raise the underlying trend in inflation relative to the previous forecast."
Longerrun inflation was still assumed to remain anchored at 2 percent.
"The staff’s forecast for economic activity remained strong but was weaker, on net, than in the November projection."
" Although aggregate demand appeared to be rising sharply in the fourth quarter, the emerging surge in COVID19 caseloads and hospitalizations was expected to weigh on economic activity in the winter months."
" All told, real GDP was expected to post a sizable gain over 2021 as a whole and to rise a bit less rapidly in 2022, with the pace of growth supported by the continued reopening of the economy and the resolution of supply constraints in most sectors."
" With the boost from these factors fading, real GDP growth was projected to step down noticeably in 2023."
" Given the higher forecast for inflation, the staff assumed monetary policy would be less accommodative in coming years and therefore revised down the mediumterm forecast for GDP somewhat."
  The staff continued to judge that the risks to the baseline projection for economic activity were skewed to the downside and that the risks around the inflation projection were skewed to the upside.
" In particular, the possibility that COVID19 cases could continue to rise steeply, especially if the Omicron variant proves to be vaccine resistant, was seen as an important source of downside risk to activity, while the possibility of more severe and persistent supply issues was viewed as an additional downside risk to activity and as an upside risk to inflation."
"Participants’ Views on Current Economic Conditions and the Economic Outlook  In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2021 through 2024 and over the longer run based on their individual assessments of apPage 8Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________propriate m onetary policy, including the path of the federal funds rate."
" The longerrun projections represented each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy."
"In their discussion of current economic conditions, participants noted that, with progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment had continued to strengthen."
" Job gains had been solid in recent months, and the unemployment rate had declined substantially."
Supply and demand imbalances  related to the pandemic and the reopening of the economy had continued to contribute to elevated levels of inflation.
 An easing of supply constraints was expected to support continued gains in economic activity and employment as well as a reduction in inflation.
"Participants observed that growth of economic activity appeared to have been strong  in the fourth quarter after having slowed in the third qua rter, and they generally expected robust growth to cont inue in 2022."
" A few participants cited healthy household balance sheets, the need for businesses to rebuild inventory, and accommodative financial conditions as factors supporting continued robust growth."
"In their discussion of the household sector, participants generally noted that demand for consumer goods had remained strong, likely suppo rted by accommodative fiscal and monetary policies, increased household income as more people found jobs, increasing net worth of the household sector, and the high level of savings accumulated through the course of the pandemic."
  Participants noted that supply chain bottlenecks and labor shortages continued to limit businesses’ ability to meet strong demand.
 A few participants noted the recent decline in the unemployment rates of African Americans and Hispanics and the narrowing of the racial and ethnic gap in the primeage employmentto-population ratio as suggesting a more inclusive labor market recovery.
"  Participants pointed to a number of signs that the U.S. labor market was very tight,  including nearrecord rates Minutes of the Meeting of December 14–15, 2021Page 9_____________________________________________________________________________________________of quits and j ob vacancies, as well as a notable pickup in wage growth."
" In line with the recent data showing a rise in the employment cost inde x, many participants reported District business contacts either planning or having implemented larger wage increases to retain current employees or attract new workers."
 Participants generally noted that they were monitoring the incoming data for signs of inflationary pressu res associated with the increasingly tight labor market.
" Acknowledging that the maximum level of employment consistent with price stability may evolve over time, many participants saw the U.S. economy making rapid progress toward the Committee’s maximumemployment goal."
 Several participants viewed labor market conditions as already largely consistent with maximum employment.
 Participants remarked that inflation readings had been higher and were more persistent and widespread than previously anticipated.
 Some participants noted that trimmed mean measures of inflation had reached decade-high levels and that the percentage of product categories with substantial price increases continued to climb.
" While participants ge nerally continued to anticipate that inflation would decline significantly over the course of 2022 as supply constraints eased, almost all stated that they had revised up their forecasts of inflation for 2022 notably, and many did so for 2023 as well."
" In discussing their revisions to the inflation outlook, participants pointed to rising housing costs and rents, more widespread wage growth driven by labor shortages, and more prolonged global supplyside frictions, which could be exacerbated by the emergence of the Omicron variant."
"In their comments on inflati on expectations, some participants discussed the risk that recent elevated levels of inflation could increase the public’s longerterm expectations for inflation to a level above that consistent with the Committee’s longerrun inflation objective."
 They noted that the realization of such a development could make it harder for the Committee to achieve 2 percent inflation over the longer run.
 A couple of participants pointed to reports of higher inflation expectations of businesses and of increased us e of costof-living adjustments in wage negotiations as early developments that could potentially affect the anchoring of inflation expectations.
" A few participants, however, noted that longterm inflation expectations remained well anchored, citing stable readings of mark etbased inflation compensation measures or the genera lly low level of longerterm bond yields."
 Most agreed that risks to inflation were weighted to the upside.
" Several participants pointed to the possibilit y that structural factors that kept inflation low in the previous decade, such as technological changes, demographics, and the proximity of the ELB in an environmen t of low equilibrium interest rates, may reemerge when the effects of the pandemic abate."
 A couple of ot hers noted the risk that persistent real wage growth in excess of productivity growth could trigger inflationary wage–price dynamics.
" Many participants noted that the pandemic, particularly new variants of the virus, continue d to pose downside risks to economic activity and upsi de risks to inflation."
"In their consideration of the stance of monetary policy, participants reaffirmed th e Federal Reserve’s commitment to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy during this challenging time, thereby promoting the Committee’s statutory goals of maximum employment and price stability."
 Participants agreed that the Committee’s criteria of inflation rising to 2 percent and moderately exceeding 2 percent for some time had been more than met.
" All participants remarked that inflation had continued to run notably above 2 percent, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic and the reopening of the economy."
" With respect to the maximum-employment criterion, participants noted that the labor market had been making rapid progress as measured by a variety of indicators, including solid job gains reported in recent months, a substantial further decline in a range of unemployment rates to l evels well below  those prevailing a year ago, and a labor force participation rate that had recently edged up."
" Many participants judged that, if the current pace of improvement continued, labor markets would fast approach maximum employment."
 Several participants remarked that they viewed labor market conditi ons as already largely consistent with maximum employment.
"     Page 10Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________In supp ort of the Committee’s goals of maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run, participants judged that it would be appropriate for the Committee to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent until labor market conditions had reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessments of maximum employment, a condition most participants judged could be met relatively soon if the recent pace of labor market improvements continued."
 A few participan ts remarked that maximum employment consistent with price stability evolves over time and that further improvements in labor markets were likely over subsequent  years as the economy continued to expand.
" Some participants also remarked that there could be circumstances in which it would be appropriate for the Committee to raise the target range for the federal funds rate before maximum employment had been fully achieved—for example, if the Committee judged that its employment and pricestability goals were not complementary in light of economic developments and that inflation pressures and inflation expectations were moving materially and pe rsistently higher in a way that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s longerrun goals."
"  In light of elevated inflation pressures and the strengthening labor market, participan ts judged that the increase in policy accommodation provided by the ongoing pace of net asset purchases was no longer necessary."
" Participants generally noted that, given their individual outlooks for the economy, the labor market, and inflation, it may become warranted to increase the federal funds rate sooner or at a faster pace than participants had earlier anticipated."
 Some participants judged that a less accommodative future stance of policy would likely be warranted and that the Committee should convey a strong commitment to address elevated inflation pressures.
"Committee Policy Action  In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that with progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment had continue d to strengthen."
" Job gains had been solid in recent months, and the unemployment rate had declined substantially."
 They remarked that supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic and the reopening of the economy had continued to contribute to elevated levels of inflation.
" Progress on vaccinations and an easing of supply constraints were expected to support continued gains in economic activity and employment as well as a reduction in inflation, but risks to the economic outlook remained, including from new variants of the virus."
"As elevated inflation had persisted for longer than they had previously anticipated, members agreed that it was appropriate to remove the re ference to “transitory” factors affecting inflation in the postmeeting statement and instead note that supply and demand imbalances have continued to contribute to elevated inflation."
"Minutes of the Meeting of December 14–15, 2021Page 11_____________________________________________________________________________________________Membe rs agr eed that the Federal Reserve was committed to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum employment and price stability goals."
 All members reaffirmed their commitment to seek to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run.
" They agreed that the inflation criteria in the guidance had been met and that the postmeeting statement should note that with inflation having exceeded 2 percent for some time, the Committee expected that it would be  appropriate to maintain the current target range of 0 to ¼ percent until labor market conditions had reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessments of maximum employment."
"  In light of inflation developments and the further improvement in the labor market, members decided to reduce the monthly pace of the Federal Reserve’s net asset purchases by $20 billion for Treasury securities and $10 billion for agency MBS."
Members noted that the Committee was prepared to adjust the pace of purchases if warranted by changes in the economic outlook and that it was important to maintain the flexibility to adjust the stance of policy as appropriate in response to changes in  the Committee’s outlook for the labor market and inflation.
" Members agreed that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and that they would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate in the event that risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals."
" They also concurred that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments."
"Allow modest deviations from statedamounts for purchases and reinvestments,if needed for operational reasons.Engage in dollar roll and  coupon swaptransactions as necessary  to facilitate settlement of the Federal Rese rve’s agency MBStransactions.”The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2:00 p.m.: “The Federal Reserve is committed to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time , thereby promoting its maximum employment and price stability goals."
"With progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have continued to strengthen."
" Job gains have been solid in recent months, and the unemployment rate has declined substantially."
 Supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic and the reopening of the economy have continued to contribute to elevated levels of inflation.
 Progress on vaccinations and an easing of supply constraints are expected to support continued gains in economic activity and employment as well as a reduction in inflation.
The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run.
"With inflation having exceeded 2 percent for some time, the Committee expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessments of maximum employment."
" In light of inflation developments and the further improvement in the labor market, the Committee decided to reduce the monthly pace of its net asset purchases by $20 billion for Treasury securities and $10 billion for agency mortgagebacked securities."
"In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of in coming information for the economic outlook."
 The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals.
" The Committee’s assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financia l and international developments.” Voting for this action :  Jerome H."
"Consistent with the Committee’s decision to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the Board voted unanimously to maintain the interest rate paid on reserve balances at 0.15 percent, effective December 16, 2021."
