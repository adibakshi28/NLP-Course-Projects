 It could also reinforce the Committee’s communications indicating that the FOMC was flexible in its plans for balance sheet normalization and that  the process of balance sheet normalization would remain consistent with the attainment of the Federal Re serve’s monetary policy objectives.
" However, the longerrun level of reserves and size of the balance sheet would ultimately be determined by longterm demand for Federal Reserve liabilities."
"The staff noted that, once balance sheet runoff ended, the average level of reserves would tend to decline gradually, in line with trend growth in the Federal Reserve’s nonreserve liabilities, until the Committee chose to resume growth of the balance sheet in order to maintain a level of reserves consistent with efficient and effective policy implementation."
Participants judged that ending the runoff of securities holdings at the end of September would reduce uncertainty about the Federal Reserve’s plans for its securities holdings and would be consistent with the Committee’s decision at its January 2019 meeting to continue implementing monetary policy in a regime of ample reserves.
Participants commented on c onsiderations related to allowing the average level of reserves to decline in line with trend growth in nonreser ve liabilities for a time after the end of balance sheet runoff.
" Several participants preferred to stabilize the average level of reserves by resuming purchases of Treasury securities relatively soon after the end of runoff, because they saw little benefit to further declines in reserve balances or because they thought the Committee should minimize the risk of interest rate volatility that co uld occur if the supply of reserves dropped below a point consistent with efficient and effective implementation of policy."
" Some others preferred to allow the average level of reserves to continue to decline for a longer time after balance sheet runoff ends because such declines could allow the Committee to learn more about underlying reserve demand, because they judged that such a process was not likely to result in excessive volatility  in money market rates, or because they judged that moving to lower levels of reserves was more consistent with the Committee’s previous communications indicating that it would hold no more securities than necess ary for implementing monetary policy efficiently and effectively."
" Participants noted that the eventual resumption of purchases of securities to keep pace with growth in demand for the Federal Reserve’s liabilities, whenever it occurred, would be a normal part of operations to maintain the amplereserves monetary policy implementation regime and would not represent a change in the stance of monetary policy."
" Some participants suggested that, at future meetings, the Committee should discuss the potential benefits and costs of tools that might re duce reserve demand or support interest rate control."
" At its January meeting, the Committee stated that it intends to continue to implement monetary policy in a regime in which an ample supply of reserves ensures that control over the level of  the federal funds rate and other shortterm interest rates is exercised primarily through the setting of the Federal Reserve’s administered rates and in which acti ve management of the supply of reserves is not required."
 The Statement Regarding Monetary Policy Implemen tation and Balance Sheet Normalization released in January as well as the principles and plans listed below together revise and replace the Committee’s earlier Policy Normalization Principles and Plans.
oThe average level of reserves after the FOMC has concluded the reduction of its aggregate securities holdings at the end of September will likely still be somewhat above the level of reserves necessary to efficiently and effectively implement monetary policy.
" During such a pe riod, persistent gradual increases in currency and other nonreserve liabilities would be accompanied by corresponding gradual declines in reserve balances to a level consistent with efficient and effective implementation of monetary policy."
" Once that point is reached, the Committee will begin increasing its securities holdings to keep pace with trend growth of the Federal Reserve’s nonreserve liabilities and maintain an appropriate le vel of reserves in the system."
" In Europe, measures announced by the European Central Bank (ECB) in March, in cluding an extension of forward guidance on interest rates and the announcement of another round of targeted  longterm refinancing operations, were followed by a decline in euroarea equity markets, particularly  bank stocks, as well as declines in euroarea rates."
" Market contacts attributed the price reaction to a perception that the measures were not as stimulative as might have been expected, given downward revisions in the ECB’s growth and inflation forecasts."
" In China, authorities moved toward an easier fiscal and monetary stance; China’s aggregate credit growth had rebounded slightly in rece nt months relative to the declining trend observed last year."
" Consistent with ongoing investor uncertainty over the outcome, risk reversals on the pound–dollar currency pair continued to point to higher demand for protection against pound depreciation relative to the dollar."
 The effective federal funds rate (EFFR) continued to be very st able at a level equal to the interest rate on excess reserves.
"  The deputy manager also discussed the transition to a longrun regime of ample reserves, following the Committee’s January announcement that it intends to continue to implement monetary policy in such a regime."
" In doing so, the Desk will need to assess banks’ demand for re serves as well as forecast other Federal Reserve liabiliti es and plan operations to maintain a supply of reserves sufficient to ensure that control over shortterm inte rest rates is exercised primarily through the setting of administered rates."
" On the one hand, a lower minimum operating level might increase the risk of excessive interest rate volat ility."
" On the other hand, a lower minimum operating le vel could provide more opportunities to learn about un derlying reserve demand or could be viewed as more consistent with moving to the smallest securities holdings necessary for efficient and effective monetary policy implementation."
"Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information available for the March 19–20 meeting indicated that labor market conditions remained strong, although growth in real gross domestic product (GDP) appeared to have slowed markedly in the first quarter of this year from its solid four thquarter pace."
" Consumer price inflation, as measured by the 12month percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), was somewh at below 2 percent in December, held down in part by recent declines in consumer energy prices, while PC E price inflation for items other than food and energy wa s close to 2 percent; more recent readings on PCE price inflation were delayed by the earlier federal government shutdown."
"Increases in total nonfar m payroll employment remained solid, on average, in recent months; employment rose only a little in February  but had expanded strongly in January."
" The national unemployment rate edged down, on net, over the past two months to 3.8 percent in February, and both the labor  force participation rate and the employmentto-population ratio rose slightly on balance."
" The unemployment rates for African Americans, Asians, and Hispanics in  February were at or below their levels at the end of the previous economic expansion, though persistent differentials in unemployment rates across groups remained."
" The rate of privatesector job openings in January was the same as its fourthquarter average and remained elevated, while the rate of quits edged up in January; the fourweek moving average of initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits  through early March was still near historically low levels."
" The employment co st index for privatesector workers increased 3 percent over the 12 months ending in December, somewhat faster than a year earlier."
" Key factors that influence consumer spending—including a low unemployment rate, ongoing gain s in real labor compensation, and still elevated measures of households’ net worth—were supportive of a pickup in consumer spending to a solid pace in the near term."
"Real residential investment ap peared to be softening further in the first quarter, like ly reflecting, in part, decreases in the affordability of housing arising from both the net increase in mortgage interest rates over the past year and ongoing house price appreciation."
 Growth in real private expenditures for business equipment and intellectual property looked to be slowing in the first quarter.
The nominal U.S. international trade deficit narrowed in November before widening in December to the largest deficit since 2008.
 The BE A estimated that the change in net exports was a drag of  about ¼ percentage point on the rate of real GDP growth in the fourth quarter.
" Core PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in consumer food and energy prices, was 1.9 percent over that same period, somewhat higher than a year earl ier."
" The consumer price index (CPI) rose 1.5 percent ov er the 12 months ending in February, while core CPI inflation was 2.1 percent."
" Recent readings on surveybased measures of longerrun inflation expectations—including those from the Michigan survey, the Blue Chip Economic Indicators, and the Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants—were little  changed on balance."
Economic growth in foreig n economies slowed further in the fourth quarter.
" In the advanced foreign economie s (AFEs), recent data suggested that economic activity, especially in the manufacturing sector, remained subdued in the first quarter of this year."
" Economic activity also remained weak in many EMEs, particul arly in Mexico and emerging Asia excluding China, although some data pointed to a modest pickup in China."
" Inflation in foreign economies slowed further early this year, partly reflecting lower retail energy prices across both AFEs and EMEs.  Staff Review of the Financial Situation Investor sentiment toward risky assets continued to improve over the intermeeting pe riod."
 Market participants cited accommodative monetary policy communications and optimism for a trade deal between the United States and China as factors that contributed to the improvement.
" Meanwhile, financing conditions for businesses and hous eholds improved slightly and generally remained supporti ve of economic activity."
" Subsequent communications—including the minutes of the January FOMC meeting, the Chair’s se miannual testimony to the Congress, and speeches by FOMC participants—were interpreted as reflecting a pa tient approach to monetary policy in the near term and a likely conclusion to the Federal Reserve’s balance shee t reduction by the end of this year."
" Communications from FOMC participants that were more accommodative than expected amid muted readings on inflation, communications from other major central banks that, on balanc e, were also regarded as more accommodative than expected, and generally mixed economic data releases reportedly contributed to the decrease in yields and outweighed improved risk sentiment."
" Measures of inflation compensation derived from Treasury  InflationProtected Securities increased modestly, on net, although they remained below levels seen last fall."
" Improved prospects for a trade deal between the United States and China and accommodative monetary policy were cited as driving factors that outweighed weakerMinutes of the Meeting of March 19–20, 2019 Page 7 ____________________________________________________________________________________________ _thanexpected announcements of corporate earnings for the fourth quarter of 2018 and earnings projections for 2019."
" Yield spreads on commercial paper and negotiable certificates of deposit generally narrowed further fr om their elevated yearend levels, likely reflecting an incr ease in investor demand for shortterm financial assets."
" Communications by major central banks, which were, on net, more accommodative than expected, along with optimism regarding trade negotiations between the United Stat es and China, contributed to the upward price moves and more than offset the effects of continued concer ns about foreign economic growth."
"  At the same time, longterm AFE yields declined somewhat, on net, on communications from major foreig n central banks and investors’ concerns about fore ign economic growth."
" Issuance of nonagency CMBS remained strong through February, and CRE lending by banks grew at a strong pace in February following relatively sluggish growth in January."
" Credit card loan growth remained strong through December, though the pace slowed during 2018 amid tighter lending standards by commercial banks."
 Auto  loan growth remained steady through the end of 2018.
 This revision reflected the effects of weakerthan-expected incoming da ta on both aggregate domestic spending and foreign economic growth that were only partially offset by a some what higher projected path for domestic equity prices and a lower projected trajectory for interest rates.
" The staff forecast that U.S. real GDP growth would slow markedly in the first quarter, reflecting a softening in growth of both consumer spending and business investment."
 But the staff judged that the firstquarter slowdown would be transitory and that real GDP growth would bounce back solidly in the Page 8 Federal Open Market Committee____________________________________________________________________________________________ _second quarter.
" In the mediumterm projection, real GDP growth was forecast to run at a rate similar to the staff’s estimate of potential output growth in 2019 and 2020—a somewhat lower trajec tory, on net, for real GDP than in the previous projection—and then slow to a pace below potential output growth in 2021."
 The un employment rate was projected to decline a little further below the staff’s estimate of its longerrun natural ra te but to bottom out by the end of this year and begin to  edge up in 2021.
" With labor market conditions judged to still be tight, the staff continued to assume that pr ojected employment gains would manifest in smallerthan-usual downward pressure on the unemployment ra te and in largerthan-usual upward pressure on the labor force participation rate."
"  The staff’s forecast for inflation was revised down slightly for the March FOMC meeting, reflecting some recent softerthan-expected readings on consumer prices."
" Total PCE price inflation was forecast to run a bit below core inflation over the next three years, reflecting projected declines in energy prices."
"  The staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as generally similar to the average of the past 20 years."
 The staff also saw the risks to the forecasts for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate as roughly balanced.
" On the downside, the recent softening in a number of economic indicators could be the harbinger of a substantial deteriorat ion in economic activity."
" Moreover, trade policies an d foreign economic developments could move in directi ons that have significant negative effects on U.S. econom ic growth."
 Risks to the inflation projection also were seen as balanced.
" The upside risk that inflation could increase more than expected in an economy that is still projected to be operating notably above potential for an extended period was counterbalanced by the downside risk that longerterm inflation expectations may be lower than was assumed in the staff forecast, as well as th e possibility that the dollar could appreciate if foreign economic conditions deteriorated."
"Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, members of the Board of Governors and Federal Reserv e Bank presidents submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real GDP growth , the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2019 through 2021 and over the longer run, based on their individual assessments of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate."
" The longerrun projections represented each participant’s assessment of the ra te to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy."
Participants agreed that in formation received since the January meeting indicated that  the labor market had remained strong but that growth of economic activity had slowed from its solid rate in the fourth quarter.
" Payroll employment was little chan ged in February, but job gains had been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate had re mained low."
 Recent indicators pointed to slower growth of household spending and business fixed investment in the first quarter.
" On a 12month basis, overall inflation had declined, largely as a result of lower energy prices; inflation for items other than food and energy remained near 2 percent."
" On balance, marketbased measures of inflation compensation had remained low in recent months, and surveybased measures of longerterm inflation expectations were little changed."
"Participants continued to vi ew a sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committe e’s symmetric 2 percent objective as the most likely outcomes over the next few years."
" Nevertheless, participants generally ex pected the growth rate of real GDP this year to step down from the pace seen over 2018 to a rate at or modestly above their estimates of longerrun growth."
" Participants cited various factors as Minutes of the Meeting of March 19–20, 2019 Page 9 ____________________________________________________________________________________________ _likely to contribute to the stepdown, including slower foreign growth and waning effects of fiscal stimulus."
" A number of participants judged that economic growth in the remaining quarters of 2019 and in the subsequent couple of years would likely be a little lower, on balance, than they had previously forecast."
 Reasons cited for these downward revisions included disappointing news on global growth and less of a boost from fiscal policy than had previously been anticipated.
"In their discussion of the household sector, participants noted that softness in consumer spending had contributed importantly to the projected slowing in economic growth in the current quarter."
" Consequently, many participants expected consumer spending to proceed at a stronger pace in coming months, supported by favorable underlying factors,  including a strong labor market, solid growth in household incomes, improvements in financial conditions  and in households’ balance sheet positions, and upbeat consumer sentiment."
Participants also commented on the apparent slowing of growth in business fixed inve stment in the first quarter.
" Factors cited as consistent with the recent softness in investment growth included downward revisions in forecasts of corporate earnings; relatively low energy prices that provided less incentive for new drilling and exploration; flattening capital goods orders; reports from contacts of softer export sales and of weaker economic activity abroad; elevated leve ls of uncertainty about government policies, including trade policies; and the likely effect of recent financial market volatility on business sentiment."
" Some contacts in manufact uring and other sectors reported that business conditi ons were favorable, with strong demand for labor, bu siness sentiment had recovered from its recent decline, and recent reductions in mortgage interest rates woul d provide some support for construction activity."
Participants noted that the latest readings on overall inflation had been somewhat softer than expected.
" However, participants observed that these readings largely reflected the effects of earlier declines in crude oil prices and that core inflation remained near 2 percent."
" Most participants, while seeing inflation pressures as muted, expected the overall rate of inflation to firm somewhat and to be at or near the Committee’s longerrun objective of 2 percent over the next few years."
" Many participants indicated that, while in flation had been close to 2 percent last year, it was noteworthy that it had not shown greater signs of firming in response to strong labor market conditions and ri sing nominal wage growth, as well as to the shortterm  upward pressure on prices arising from tariff increases."
 A few participants observed that the pickup in productivity growth last year was a welcome development he lping to bolster potential output and damp inflationary pressures.
"In their discussion of indicators of inflation expectations, participants noted that  marketbased measures of inflation compensation had ri sen modestly over the intermeeting period, although they remained low."
 Several particip ants suggested that longerterm inflation expectations co uld be at levels somewhat below those consistent with the Committee’s 2 percent inflation objective and that this might make it more difficult to achieve that objec tive on a sustained basis.
"In their discussion of the labor market, participants cited evidence that conditions remained strong, including the very low unemployment rate, a further increase in the labor force participation rate, a low number of layoffs, nearrecord levels of j ob openings and helpwanted postings, and solid job gains, on average, in recent months."
" Participants observed that, following strong job gains in January, there had been little growth in payrolls in February, although a few participants pointed out that the February reading had likely been affected by adverse weather conditions."
" A couple of participants noted that, over the medium term, some easing in payroll growth was to be expected as economic growth slowed to its longerrun tren d rate."
" Reports from business contacts predominantly pointed to continued Page 10 Federal Open Market Committee____________________________________________________________________________________________ _strong labor demand, with fi rms offering both higher wages and more nonwage benefi ts to attract workers."
 Economywide wage growth wa s seen as being broadly consistent with rece nt rates of labor pr oductivity growth and with inflation of 2 percent.
 A few participants cited the combination of muted inflation pressures and expanding employment as a possible indication that some slack remained in the labor market.
Participants commented on a number of risks associated with their outlook for economic activity.
" Participants also mentioned a number of upside risks regarding the outlook fo r economic activity, including outcomes in which various sources of uncertainty were resolved favorably, consumer and business sentiment rebounded sharply, or the recent strengthening in labor productivity growth signaled a pickup in the underlying trend."
 Upside risk s to the outlook for inflation included the possibility that wage pressures could rise unexpectedly and lead to greaterthan-expected price increases.
" Several participants expressed concern that the yield curve for Treasury securities was now quite flat and noted that historical evidence suggested that an inverted yield curve could portend economic weakness; however , their discussion also noted that the unusually low level of term premiums in longerterm interest rates made historical relationships a less reliable basis for assessing the implications of the recent behavior of the yield curve."
"  P a r t i c i p a n t s  judged that the labor market remained strong, but that information received over th e intermeeting period, including recent readings on household spending and business fixed investment, po inted to slower economic growth in the early part of this year than in the fourth quarter of 2018."
" Despite these indications of softer firstquarter growth, participants generally expected economic activity to continue to expand, labor markets to remain strong, and inflation to  remain near 2 percent."
" In light of these uncertainties as  well as continued evidence of muted inflation pressure s, participants generally agreed that a patient approach to determining future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate remained appropriate."
 Se veral participants observed that the characterization of the Committee’s approach to monetary policy as “patient” would need to be reviewed regularly as the economic outlook and uncertainties surrounding the outlook evolve.
"  With regard to the outlook for monetary policy beyond this meeting, a majority of participants expected that the evolution of the economic outlook and risks to the outlook would likely warrant leaving the target range unchanged for the remainder of the year."
 Several of these participants noted that the current target range for the federal funds rate was close to their estimates of its longerrun neutral level an d foresaw economic growth continuing near its longerrun  trend rate over the forecast period.
" Some participants indicated that if the economy evolved as they currently expected, with economic growth above its longerMinutes of the Meeting of March 19–20, 2019 Page 11 ____________________________________________________________________________________________ _run trend rate, they would likely judge it appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate modestly later this year."
" Such misinterpretations could complicate the Committee’s communications regarding its view of appropri ate monetary policy, particularly in circumstances when the future course of policy is unusually uncertain."
" None theless, several participants noted that the policy rate projections in the SEP are a valuable component of the ov erall information provided about the monetary policy outlook."
   Participants also discussed alternative interpretations of subdued inflation pressures in current economic circumstances and the associated po licy implications.
" Several participants observed that li mited inflationary pressures during a period of historically low unemployment could be a sign that low inflati on expectations were exerting downward pressure on inflation relative to the Committee’s 2 percent inflation targ et; in addition, subdued inflation pressures could indicate  a less tight labor market than suggested by common measures of resource utilization."
" Consistent with th ese observations, several participants noted that various indicators of inflation expectations had remained at the lo wer end of their historical range, and a few participants commented that they had recently revised down their estimates of the longerrun unemployment rate consistent with 2 percent inflation."
" Some participants regarded their judgments that the federal funds rate was likely to remain on a very flat trajectory as reflecting other factors, such as low estimates of the longerrun neutral real interest rate or riskmanagement considerations."
" A few participants observed that the appropriate path for policy, insofar as it implied lower interest rates for longer periods of time, could lead to greater financia l stability risks."
"  Committee Policy Action  In their discussion of mone tary policy for the period ahead, members judged that the information received since the Committee met in January indicated that the labor market remained strong  but that growth of economic activity had slowed fr om its solid rate in the fourth quarter."
" Payroll em ployment was little changed in February, but job gains had been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate had remained low."
 Recent indicators pointed to slower growth of household spending and bu siness fixed investment in the first quarter.
" On a 12month basis, overall inflation had declined, largely as a result of lower energy prices; inflation for items other than food and energy remained near 2 percent."
" On balance, marketbased measures of inflation compensation had remained low in recent months, and surveybased measures of longerterm inflations expectations were little changed."
"In their consideration of the economic outlook, members noted that financial co nditions had improved since the beginning of year, but that some time would be needed to assess whether indications of weak economic growth in the first quarter would persist in subsequent quarters."
 Members also noted that inflationary pressures remained muted and that a number of uncertainties bearing on the U.S. and global economic outlook still awaited resolution.
" However, members continued to view sustained expansion of  economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective as the most likely outcomes for the U.S. economy in the period ahead."
" In light of global economic and financial developments and muted inflation pressures, members concurred that the Committee could be patient as it determined what future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate may be appropriate to support those outcomes."
"After assessing current conditions and the outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, members decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 2¼ to 2½ percent."
" Members agreed that in determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee would assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to the Committee’s maximumemployment and symmetric 2 percent inflation objectives."
" They reiterated that this assessment would take into account a wide range of information, including Page 12 Federal Open Market Committee____________________________________________________________________________________________ _measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and internationa l developments."
" More generally, members noted that decisions regarding nearterm adjustments of the st ance of monetary policy would appropriately remain dependent on the evolution of the outlook as informed by incoming data."
" While payroll employment had been little changed in February, job gain s had been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate had remained low."
" Members also agreed to note that growth in economic activity appeared  to have slowed from its solid rate in the fourth quarter, consistent with recent indicators of household spendi ng and business fixed investment."
" The description of  overall inflation was revised to recognize that inflation had declined, largely as a result of lower energy prices, while still noting that inflation for items other than food and energy remained near 2 percent."
The Committee also directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve’s agency mortgagebacked securities transactions.” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p.m.: “Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in January indicates that the labor market remains strong but that growth of economic activity has slowed from its solid rate in the fourth quarter.
" Payroll employment was little changed in February, but job gains have been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate  has remained low."
 Recent indicators point to slower growth of household spending and business fixed investment in the first quarter.
" On a 12month basis, overall inflation has declined, largely as a result of lower energy prices; inflation for items other than food and energy remains near 2 percent."
" On balance, marketbased measures of inflation compensation have remained low in recent months, and surveybased measures of longerterm inflation expectations are little changed."
"Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
" The Committee continues to view sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective as the most likely outcomes."
" In light of global economic and fina ncial developments and muted inflation pressures, the Committee will be patient as it determines what future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate may be appropriate to support these outcomes."
"In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized Minutes of the Meeting of March 19–20, 2019 Page 13 ____________________________________________________________________________________________ _and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective."
" This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and internatio nal developments.” Voting for this action:   Jerome H."
"Consistent with the Committee’s decision to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the Board of Governors voted unanimously to leave the interest rates on required and excess reserve balances unchanged at 2.40 percent and voted unanimously to approve establishment of the primary credit rate at the existing level of 3.00 percen t, effective March 21, 2019."
"Clouse Secretary Page 14 Federal Open Market Committee____________________________________________________________________________________________ _Summary of Economic Projections  In conjunction with the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting held on March 19–20, 2019, meeting participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real gross domestic product (GDP) growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2019 to 2021 and ov er the longer run."
" Each participant’s projections were based on information available at the time of the meeting, together with his or her assessment of appropria te monetary policy—including a path for the federal funds rate and its longerrun value—and assumptions about ot her factors likely to affect economic outcomes."
" The longerrun projections represent each participant’s assessment of the value to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy.1  “Appropriate monetary policy” is defined as  the future path of policy that each participant deems most likely to foster outcomes for economic activity and inflation that best satisfy his or her individual in terpretation of the statutory mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability."
"Participants who submitted longerrun projections generally expected that, under appropriate monetary policy, growth of real GDP in 2019 would run at or somewhat above their individual estimates of its longerrun rate."
" Most participants continued to expect real GDP growth to edge down over the projection horizon, with almost all participants projecting gr owth in 2021 to be at or below their estimates of its longerrun rate."
 All participants who submitted longerrun pr ojections continued to expect that the unemployment rate would run at or below their estimates of its longerrun level through 2021.
" Almost all participants projecte d that inflation, as measured by the fourquarter percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), would increase slightly over the next two years, and most participants expected that it would be at or slightly above the Committee’s 2 percent objective in 2020 and 2021."
" Compared with the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) from December 2018, all participants marked down somewhat their projections for real GDP growth in 2019, and most revised down slightly their projections for total inflation in 2019."
"1 One participant did not submit longerrun projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, or the federal funds rate."
"As shown in figure 2, most participants expected that the evolution of the economy, relative to their objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation, would likely warrant keeping the federal funds rate at its current level through the end of 2019."
" While a majority of participants viewed the risks to the outlook as balanced, a couple more participants than in December viewed the risks to inflation as weighted to the downside."
"The Outlook for Economic Activity As shown in table 1, the medi an of participants’ projections for the growth rate of real GDP in 2019, conditional on their individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy, was 2.1 percent."
" Most participants continued to expect GDP growth to slow throughout the projection horizon, with the median projection at 1.9 percent in 2020 and at 1.8 percent in 2021, a touch lower than the median estimate  of its longerrun rate of 1.9 percent."
" Relative to the December SEP, the medians of the projections for real GDP growth in 2019 and 2020 were 0.2 percentage point and 0.1 percentage point lower, respectively."
" Most participants mentioned a recent patch of weake r data on domestic economic activity, and some pointed to a softer global growth outlook, as factors behind the downwa rd revisions to their nearterm growth estimates."
"The median of projections fo r the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of 2019 was 3.7 percent, about ½ percentage point below the median  assessment of its longerrun level."
 These median unemployment rates were a little higher than those from the December SEP.
"  Nevertheless, most participants continued to project that the unemployment rate in 2021 would be below their estimates of its longerrun level."

Projections forthe unemployment rate are for the average civilian unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of the year indicated.
Each participant’s projections arebased on his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy.

Figures 3.A and 3.B show the distributions of participants’ projections for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate from 2019 to 2021 and in the longer run.
" The distribution of individual projections for real GDP growth for 2019 shifted down re lative to that in the December SEP, while the distributions for 2020, 2021, and the longerrun rate of GDP growth changed only slightly."
" The distributions of  individual projections for the unemployment rate in 2019 and 2020 moved modestly higher relative to those in December, and the distribution in 2021 edged higher  as well."
" Meanwhile, the distribution for the longer -run unemployment rate shifted down a touch."
"The Outlook for Inflation As shown in table 1, the medi ans of projections for total PCE price inflation were 1.8 percent in 2019 and 2.0 percent in both 2020 and 2021, each a touch lower than in the December SEP."
" The medians of projections for core PCE price inflation over the 2019–21 period were 2.0 percent, the same as in December."
Figures 3.C and 3.D provide information on the distributions of participants’ views about the outlook for inflation.
" The distributions of projections for total PCE price inflation and core PCE price inflation in 2019, 2020, and 2021 shifted down slightly from the December SEP."
 Almost all participants expected that total and core PCE price inflation would be between 1.8 and 2.2 percent throughout the projection horizon.

"The conﬁdence interval is not strictly consistent with theprojections for the federal funds rate, primarily because these projections are not forecasts of the likeliest outcomes forthe federal funds rate, but rather projections of participants’ individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy.Still, historical forecast errors provide a broad sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rategenerated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policythat may be appropriate to oﬀset the eﬀects of shocks to the economy.The conﬁdence interval is assumed to be symmetric except when it is truncated at zero—the bottom of the lowesttarget range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted in the past by the Committee."
This truncation wouldnot be intended to indicate the likelihood of the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary policyaccommodation if doing so was judged appropriate.
"Because currentconditions may diﬀer from those that prevailed, on average, over the previous 20 years, the width and shape of theconﬁdence interval estimated on the basis of the historical forecast errors may not reﬂect FOMC participants’ currentassessments of the uncertainty and risks around their projections.* The conﬁdence interval is derived from forecasts of the average level of shortterm interest rates in the fourthquarter of the year indicated; more information about these data is available in table 2."
"The shaded area encompassesless than a 70 percent conﬁdence interval if the conﬁdence interval has been truncated at zero.Summary of Economic Pro jections of the Meeting of March 19–20, 2019 Page 15 ____________________________________________________________________________________________ _Forecast Uncertainty The economic projections provided by the members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks inform discussions of monetary policy among policymakers and can aid public understanding of the basis for policy actions."
" Thus, in setting the stance of monetary policy, participants consider not only what appears to be the most likely economic outcome as embodied in their projections, but also the range of alternative possibilities, the likelihood of their occurring, and the potential costs to the economy should they occur."
"Table 2 summarizes the average historical accuracy of a range of forecasts, including those reported in past Monetary Policy Report s and those prepared by the Federal Reserve Board’s staff in advance of meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)."
" The corresponding 70 percent confidence intervals for overall inflation would be 1.1 to 2.9 percent in the current year, 1.0 to 3.0 percent in the second year, and 0.9 to 3.1 percent in the third year."
" Figures 4.A thro ugh 4.C illustrate these confidence bounds in “fan charts” that are symmetric and centered on the medians of FOMC participants’ projections for GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation."
" In particular, the unemployment rate cannot be negative; furthermore, the risks around a particular projection might be tilted to either the upside or the downside, in which case the corresponding fan chart would be asymmetrically positioned arou nd the median projection."
" These judgments are summarized in the lowerright panels of figures 4.A through 4.C. As with real activity and inflation, the outlook for the future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable uncertainty."
 This uncertainty arises primarily because each participant’s assessment of the appropriate stance of monetary policy depends importantly on the evolution of real activity and inflation over time.
 The final line in table 2 shows the error ranges for forecasts of shortterm interest rates.
" It should be noted, however, that these confidence intervals are not strictly consistent with the projections for the federal funds rate, as these projections are not forecasts of the most likely quarterly outcomes but rather are projections of participants’ individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy and are on an endof-year basis."
" However, the forecast errors should provide a sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additi onal adjustments to monetary policy that would be appropriate to offset the effects of shocks to the economy."
 This approach to the construction of the federal funds rate fan chart would be merely a convention; it would not have any implicati ons for possible future policy decisions regarding the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so were appropriate.
