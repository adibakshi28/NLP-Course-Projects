 Developments in Financial Markets and Open Market Operations  The manager turned first to a discussion of monetary policy expectations in the United States.
" Treasury yields increased across the curve, with the rise primarily reflecting higher real interest rates."

 Marketand surveybased measures of U.S. inflation expectations continued to project a significant deceleration in inflation in the coming years.
" Nonetheless, far -forward inflation compensation rose over the period, and market participants remained attentive to the risk that, in bring ing inflation back to 2  percent , the Committee would need to tighten by more than currently expected."
" In global financial developments, many advanced -economy central banks raised policy rates over the period, and investors increasingly came to anticipate tighter monetary policy ahead in most advanced foreign economies."
 Market participants noted that ongoing uncertainty about the near -term path of F ederal Reserve policy had increased demand for very short -dated investments.
" This  demand , combined with declining Treasury bill supply, contributed to the downward pressure on secured rates and to rising  overnight reverse repurchase agreement ( ON RRP) usage."
" However, first -quarter growth in private domestic final demand was faster than in the previous quarter, while labor market conditions tightened further in March."
 Consumer price inflation through March —as measured by the 12 -month percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE)— remained elevated.
" Total nonfarm payroll employment rose in March, and the unemployment rate declined to 3.6  percent ."
" The unemployment rates for African Americans and for Hispanics moved lower, though both rates remained noticeably higher than the national average."
" The labor force participation rate increased in March, as did the employment -topopulation ratio."
 The employment cost index of hourly compensation in the private sector rose 4.8  percent over the 12  months ending in March; this gain was much larger than the corresponding 12month changes posted in each of the preceding four years and was the largest 12 -month increase since 1990.
" Total PCE price inflation was 6.6 percent over the 12  months ending in March, and core PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in consumer energy prices and many consumer food prices, was 5.2  percent  over the same period."
" The trimmed mean measure of 12 -month PCE price inflation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas was 3.7  percent  in March, 2  percent age points higher than its year -earlier rate of increase."
" A new version of the staff’s common inflation expectations index, which combines information from many indicator s of inflation expectations and inflation compensation, moved up in the first quarter and was at the upper end of the range of values seen since 2005."
" Business fixed investment growth picked up sharply in the first quarter, with spending on equipment and intellectual property products posting a large increase."
" The U.S. international trade deficit widened further in the first quarter of this year, and net exports made a large negative contribution to real U.S. GDP growth."
" Goods imports continued the fourth quarter’s strong growth, driven by large increases in real imports of consumer goods, capital goods, and automotive products."
"Data sugges ted that foreign economic growth remained solid in the first quarter, as most economies continued to show adaptability to new COVID -19 waves."
" Foreign inflation increased significantly further, driven by surging energy and food prices as well as some broadening of price pressures to core goods and services."
" In response , many central banks around the world tightened their monetary policy stances."
 Staff Review of the Financial Situation  U.S. Treasury yields and the market -implied federal funds rate path moved substantially higher over the intermeeting period as Federal Reserve communications and domestic economic data releases were perceived as suggesting that a more aggressive tightening of monetary policy was likely over coming months.
" The increases in nominal T reasury yields were primarily accounted for by rising real yields , while inflation compensation implied by Treasury Inflation -Protected Securities  was little changed."
" Early in the period, equity prices increased , supported by the robust pace of economic activity and reduced market concerns about the implications for the global economy of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine."
" The initial sharp gains in stock prices were followed by larger declines later in the period, as longer -term interest rates rose substantially and as some disappointing earnings reports toward the end of the intermeeting period weighed on equity prices."
" Over the intermeeting period, sovereign yields in AFEs increased notably because of concerns about further inflationary pressures, some central bank communications that were perceived as less accommodative than expected, and spillovers from rises in U.S. Treasury yields."
" Prospects of tighter monetary policy and COVID -related lockdowns in China weighed on prices of risky assets, but investor concerns surrounding the economic effects of the war in Ukraine seemed to abate partially."
 Respondents in the April Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS) reported a continued easing of lending terms and strengthening demand for C&I loans as well as easing standards for multifamily CRE loans.
" For most small businesses, credit appeared to be available, although these businesses’ demand for credit reportedly remained weak."
" Residential mortgage credit conditions remained accommoda_____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of May 3–4, 2022Page 5 tive through March, despite the increase in mortgage interest rates , particularly for stronger borrowers who met standard loan criteria."
" The staff judged that, amid a substantial upward shift in interest rates, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and ongoing disruptions to supply chains, the financial system —outside of commodities markets —had been resilient."
 Staff Economic Outlook  The projection for U.S. economic activity prepared by the staff for the May FOMC meeting implied a trajectory for real GDP that was broadly similar to the March projection.
" The staff noted that the firstquarter  decline in real GDP was driven by categories of spending that had often been volatile in the past, and they viewed the continued strength in private domestic final demand, the labor market, and industrial production as providing a more accurate picture of  the economy’s direction in the first quarter."
 The staff therefore anticipated that GDP growth would rebound in the second quarter and advance at a solid pace over the remainder of the year.
" GDP growth was then expected to slow in 2023 and 2024 as moneta ry policy became less accommodative and financial conditions tightened further; by 2024, real GDP growth was expected to be in line with potential output growth."
" The staff’s projection for PCE price inflation was revised up slightly in the second half of 2022 and in 2023 in response to the slow resolution of supply constraints seen over the first part of 2022, a higher projected path for import prices, and a judgment that wage increases would put more upward pressure on services prices than previously assumed."
" All told, total PCE price inflation was expected to be 4.3  percent  in 2022."
 P CE price inflation was then expected to step down to 2.5  percent  in 2023 and to 2.1 percent  in 2024 as supply –demand imbalances in the economy were reduced by slowing aggregate demand and an anticipated easing of supply constraints.
 The staff continued to judge that the risks to the baseline projection for real activity were skewed to the downside and that the risks to the inflation projection were skewed to the upside.
" Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook  In their discussion of current economic conditions, participants noted that, although overall economic activity had edged down in the first quarter, household spending and business fixed investment had remained strong."
" Job gains had been robust in recent months, and the unemployment rate had declined substantially."
" Inflation remained elevated, reflecting continued supply and demand imbalances, higher energy prices, and broader price pressures."
 Th e invasion and related events were creating additional upward pressure on inflation and were likely to weigh on economic activity.
"  Against this background, participants stated  that they were highly attentive to inflation risks."
" Participants commented that after its rapid growth in the last quarter of 2021, real GDP had declined in the first quarter of this year, with net exports and inventory investment making large negative contributions to growth."
" They noted, however, that these volatile components tended to contain little signal about subsequent growth and that household spending and business fixed investment had remained strong  in the first quarter."
" In their discussion of the economic outlook beyond the near term, participants indicated that they expected that output would expand  more moderately  this year than in 2021, with growth this year  likely near or above its longer -run rate, and that the imbalance between aggregate demand and aggregate supply would diminish over  time."
 Participants saw an appropriate firming of monetary policy as playing a central role in addressing this imbalance and in supporting the Federal Reserve’s goals of maximum employment and price stability.
" An easing of supply bottlenecks, a further rise in labor force participation, and the waning effects of pandemicrelated fiscal policy support were cited as additional factors that c ould help reduce the supply –demand imbalances in the economy and lower inflation over the medium term."
"In their discussion of the ho usehold sector, participants indicated that they expected robust growth in consumption spending."
" The considerable increases in Treasury yields  across maturities over the intermeeting period  were associated with rising interest rates faced by households, particularly rates on home mortgages."
 A couple of participants reported that their business contacts continued to see robust housing demand and elevated home prices despite higher mortgage interest rates.
" With respect to the business sector, participants cited robust consumer demand, healthy household bal ance sheets, and inventory rebuilding as factors supportive of business activity and investment."
 The ability of firms to meet demand continued to be limited by labor shortages and supply chain bottlenecks.
 Participants commented that demand for labor continued to outstrip available supply across many parts of the economy and that their business contacts continued to report difficulties in hiring and retaining workers.
" Employment growth had continued at a strong pace, the unemployment rate had fallen to a near -50year low, quits and job openings had remained extremely elevated , and nominal wages had continued to rise rapidly."
" Several participants raised the possibility that, in light of th e exceptionally high ratio of vacancies to job searchers, a moderation in labor demand might serve to reduce vacancies  and wage pressures  without having significant effects on the unemployment rate."
 Participants observe d that inflation continued to run well above the Committee’s longer -run goal and that inflation pressures were evident in a broad array of goods and services.
 Various participants remarked on the hardship caused by elevated inflation and heightened inflation uncertainty —including by eroding American families’ real incomes and wealth and by making it more difficult for businesses to make production and investment plans .
 They also pointed out that high inflation could impede the achievement of maximum employment on a sustained basis.
" Participants noted that developments associated with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, including surges in energy and commodity prices, were adding to near -term inflation pressures."
 These participants  also emphasized that  price pressures remained elevated and that it was too early to be confident that inflation had peaked.
 Many participants commented that measures of short -term inflation expectations were elevated or that far -forward measures of inflation compensation were near the upper edge of their historical range.
" Several participants judged that measures of longer -term inflation expectations derived from surveys of households, professional forecasters, and market participants still appeared to be broadly consistent with the Committee’s longer -run inflation objective, likely  reflecting respondents’ confidence that the Federal Reserve would take the actions necessary to return inflation to 2  percent ."
" They noted that, together with appropriate firming of monetary policy and an eventual easing of supply constraints, well -anchored longer -term inflation expectations would support a return of inflation to levels consistent with the Committee’s longer -run goal."
" In their discussion of risks to the outlook, participants emphasized that they were highly attentive to inflation risks and would continue to monitor closely inflation developments and inflation expectations."
" They agreed that risks to inflation were skewed to the upside and cited several such risks, including those associated with ongoing supply bottlenecks and rising energy and commodity prices —both of which were exacerbated by the Russian invasion of Ukraine and COVIDrelated lockdowns in China."
 A lso mentioned were the risks associated with nominal wage growth continuing to run above levels consistent with 2  percent inflation over time and the extent to which households’ high savings since the onset of the pandemic and healthy balance sheets  would support greaterthan-expected underlying momentum in consumer spending  and contribute to upside inflation pressures .
" In addition, some participants emphasized that persistently high inflation heightened the risk that longer -term inflation expectations could become unanchored; in that case, the task of returning inflation to 2 percent  would be more difficult ."
 Several participants who commented on issues related to financial stability noted that the tightening of monetary policy could  interact with vulnerabilities related to the liquidity of markets for Treasury securities and to the private sector ’s intermediation capacity.
" These par ticipants observed  that the trading and risk -management practices of some key participants in commodities markets were not fully visible to regulatory authorities and noted that central counterparties (CCPs) needed to remain capable of managing risks associated with heightened volatility or that margin requirements at CCPs could give rise to significant liquidity demands for large banks , broker -dealers , and their clients."
"In their consideration of the appropriate stance of monetary policy, all participants concurred that the U.S. economy was very strong, the labor market was  extremely tight, and inflation was very high and well above the Committee’s 2  percent inflation objective."
" Participants judged that an appropriate firming of the stance of monetary policy, along with an eventual waning of supply– demand imbalances, would help to keep longer -term inflation expectations anchored and bring inflation down over time to levels consistent with the Committee’s 2  percent longer -run goal."
" To this end, participants agreed that the Committee should expeditiously move the stance of monetary policy toward a neutral posture,  through both increases in the target range for the federal funds rate and reductions in the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet."
" This reduction, starting on June 1, would work in parallel with increases in the target range for the policy rate in  firming the stance of monetary policy."
 Participants agreed that the economic outlook was highly uncertain an d that policy decisions should be data dependent and focused on returning inflation to the Committee’s 2  percent  goal while sustaining strong labor market conditions.
" At present, participants judged that it was important to move expeditiously to a more neutral monetary policy stance."
 Several participants commented on the challenges  that monetary policy  faced  in restoring price stability while also maintaining  strong labor market conditions.
"  Committee Policy Action  In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that, although overall economic activity had edged down in the first quarter, household spending and business fixed investment had remained strong."
" Job gains had been robust in recent months, and the unemployment rate had declined substantially."
" Members also agreed that inflation remained elevated, reflecting continued supply and demand imbalances, higher energy prices , and broader price pressures."
 Members agreed that the invasion and related events were creating additional upward pressure on inflation and were likely to weigh on economic activity.
" In light of continuing inflation risks, members judged that it would be appropriate for the postmeeting statement to note that the Committee is highly attentive to the upside risks to inflation."
" In their assessment of the monetary policy stance necessary for ach ieving the Committee’s maximum -employment and pricestability goals, members agreed that, with appropriate firming in the stance of monetary policy, they expected inflation to return to the Committee’s 2 percent objective and the labor market to remain strong."
" Members agreed that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and that they would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate in the event that risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals."
" They also concurred that their assessments would take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments."
" Following the monetary policy discussion, which included a consideration of plans for reducing the size of the balance sheet, all participants indicated  support for  the proposed plans for reducing the size of the balance sheet."
" • Over time, the Committee intends to maintain securities holdings in amounts needed to implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively in its ample reserves regime."
" o Once balance sheet runoff has ceased, reserve balances will likely continue to decline for a time, reflecting growth in other Federal Reserve liabilities, until the Committee judges that reserve balances are at an ample level."
" • Engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve’s agency MBS transactions.”  The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2:00  p.m.: “Although overall economic activity edged down in the first quart er, household spending and business fixed investment remained strong."
"  Job gains have been robust in recent months, and the unemployment rate has declined substantially."
"  Inflation remains elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher energy prices, and broader price pressures."
  The invasion and related events are creating additional upward pressure on inflation and are likely to weigh on economic activity.
  The Committee is highly attentive to inflation risks.
 The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2  percent  over the longer run.
"  With appropriate firming in the stance of monetary policy, the Committee expects inflation to return to its 2  percent  objective and the labor market to remain strong."
" In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook ."
"  The Committee’s assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.”  Voting for this action:  Jerome H."
" To support the Committee’ s decision to raise the target range for the federal funds rate, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to raise the interest rate  paid on reserve balances to 0.90 percent , effective Ma y 5, 2022."
