 Sovereign yiel ds rose sharply across many advanced economies with much of the increase concentrated in measures of inflation compensation.
" In the United States, the fiveyear measure of inflation compensation based on Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) rose by around 45 basis points."
" Far forward measures of inflation compensation also rose, but by modest amounts."
" Median fore casts beyond 2021move up by less, although the average of the probabilities reported by survey respondents placed on higher inflation outcomes at these horizons in creased modestly."
" Option-implied volatility on shortdated interest rates increased, reportedly reflecting greater uncertainty over Page 2Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________  the path of the federal funds rate."
" The Federal Reserve’s administered rates—the interest  on reserve balances rate and the overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) rate—continued to support effective interest rate control and, outside of monthand quarterend, the federal funds rate remained stable over the period."
Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information available at the time of the November 2–3 meeting suggested that U.S. real GDP growth had slowed markedly in the third quarter after the first half’s rapid pace.
" Labor market conditions continued to improve in September, though employment growth was slower than in recent months."
 Consumer price inflation in September—as measured by the 12month percentage change in the PCE price index—was elevated.
"Growth in total nonfarm payroll employment slowed further in September, held down  by a decline in state and local government employment."
" As of September, total payroll employment had retraced threefourths of the losses seen at the onset of the pandemic."
" The unemployment rate declined from 5.2 percent in August to _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of November 2–3, 2021Page 3  4.8 percent in September; the unemployment rates for African Americans and Hispanics also declined over this period, but both rates remained well above the national average."
" The labor force participation rate edged lower in September, and the employmentto-population ratio moved up."
 Initial claims for re gular state unemployment insurance moved lower through late October and were approaching the levels seen be fore the pandemic.
" Recent weekly estimates of privatesector payrolls constructed by the Board’s staff using data provided by the payroll processor ADP were especially volatile but, on balance, appeared consistent with a pickup in the pace of private employment gains relative to September."
 The employment cost index of hourly compensation in the private sector rose 4.1 percent over the 12 months ending in September; this gain was noti ceably larger than the index’s yearearlier 12month ch ange and was the fastest 12month change since 2001.
"Total PCE price inflation was 4.4 percent over the 12 months ending in September, and core PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in consumer energy prices and many consumer food prices, was 3.6 percent over the same period."
 The trimmed mean measure of 12month PCE inflation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas was 2.3 percent in September.
" In the third quarter of 2021, the staff’s common inflation expectations index, which combines information from many indicators of inflation expectations and inflation compensation, was little changed relative to the second quarter and remained at its highest level since 2014."
" Residentia l investment dropped further in the third quarter; although demand for housing was strong, shortages of construction supplies as well as tight land and labor markets restrained residential construction activity."
"Growth in business fixed inve stment slowed sharply in the third quarter, as supply bottlenecks—particularly for motor vehicles—weighed on business equipment spending and a limited availa bility of construction materials held back spending on nonresidential structures."
"The U.S. international trade deficit widened in August, reflecting a moderate pace of import growth against a subdued pace of export growth."
 Real import growth was driven by increases in cons umer goods and industrial supplies.
" Real export growth was held back by declines in capital goods, agricultural products, and automotive products."
" Advance estimates for September suggested that goods imports rose while goods exports fell, pointing to a further widening of the trade deficit."
 The Bureau of Economic Analysis estimated that a drop in net exports subtracted substantially from real GDP growth in the third quarter.
"Foreign GDP growth slowed modestly in the third quarter, as supply chain disruptions and the resurgence of COVID19 weighed on production, particularly in China and other emerging market economies (EMEs)."
" Twelvemonth rates of inflation abroad continued to rise, reflecting further increases in energy prices, persistent pressures from supply bottlenecks, and past exchange rate depreciation in some EMEs. Staff Review of the Financial Situation Over the intermeeting period, an increase in perceived inflation risks and an associated upward revision in the marketimplied path of the federal funds rate contributed to increases in Treasury yields."
"  Market participants’ views on the expected path for the federal funds rate over the next few years—implied by a straight read of overnight index swap quotes—rose substantially since the September FOMC meeting, apparently in response to perceived risks of higher inflation."
" Perceptions of increased risks related to inflation were more than offset by a shortterm resolution of the debt ceiling, a decrease in perceived risks related to the effect of the pandemic on the pace of the economic recovery, and strongerthan-expected thirdquarter earnings."
"  In major foreign markets, sovereign yields rose notably over the intermeeting period, as did inflation compensation and marketimplied measures of expected policy rates, amid sharp further increases in energy prices, concerns about higher inflation, and communications by some foreign central banks that were seen as signaling a faster removal of monetary policy accommodation."
 Gross leveraged loan issuance decreased slightly in September after its strong growth in August.
" Banks also reported that demand for C&I loans was about unchanged over the third quarter after strengthening for the previous two quart ers; on balance, loan demand was still weaker than before the pandemic."
" While loan originations to small businesses fell a bit, the results from the October SLOOS suggested that the decline appeared to reflect weak demand, particularly for small and very small firms."
" While demand for credit card s strengthened, auto loan growth slowed in response to  low dealer inventories and a weakening of auto sales."
" House prices rose rapidly, outpacing rents, but the staff did not see signs of loose mortgage underwriting standards or excessive mortgage credit growth that could potentially amplify a shock arising from falling house prices."
" For households, the level of consumer debt was largely unchanged on an inflationadju sted basis, while delinquencies returned to prepandemic levels or below."
  Staff Economic Outlook The projection for U.S. economic activity prepared by the staff for the November FOMC meeting was slightly weaker than the September projection.
" In 2022, real GDP growth was expected to re main close to its 2021 pace, supported by the continued reopening of the economy and the resolution of supply constraints in most sectors."
" With the boost from these factors fading, real GDP growth was projected to step down noticeably in 2023 and to be close to potentia l output growth in 2023 and 2024."
" However, the level of real GDP was expected to remain well above potential throughout the projection period, and the unemployment rate was expected to decline to historically low levels."
"The staff’s nearterm outlook for inflation was revised up, as consumer food and energy prices had risen faster than expected and production bottlenecks and recent wage gains were seen as putting somewhat greater upward pressure on prices than had been anticipated."
 PCE price inflation was therefore expected to step down to 2 percent in 2022 and to 1.9 percent in 2023 before edging back up to 2 percent in 2024.
The staff continued to judge that the risks to the baseline projection for economic activity were skewed to the downside and that the risks around the inflation projection were skewed to the upside.
" In particular, the possibility of another sizable wave  of COVID19 cases in the winter was seen as an important source of downside risk to activity, while the possibility of more severe and persistent supply issues was viewed as an additional downside risk to activity and as an upside risk to inflation."
"Participants’ Views on Current Economic Conditions and the Economic Outlook In their discussion of current conditions, participants noted that, with progress on vaccinations and strong Page 6Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________  policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment had continued to strengthen."
" Inflation was elevated, largely reflecting factors that were expected to be transitory."
 Supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic and the reopening of the economy had contributed to sizable price increases in some sectors.
" Progress on vaccinations and an easing of supply constraints were expected to support continued gains in economic activity and employment as well as a reduction in inflation, but risks to the economic outlook remained."
Participants observed that growth in economic activity had slowed in the third quarter to a rate significantly below the robust pace seen in the first half of the year.
" The spread of the Delta variant had contributed to the slowdown in growth in the third quarter by damping household and business spending, holding down labor supply, and intensifying supply chain disruptions."
" Participants noted that the underlying conditions supporting growth in demand remained strong and that, as the number of COVID19 cases remained well below the summer’s levels, growth in economic activity would likely show a pickup in the fourth quarter."
" They further foresaw robust growth in 2022, support ed by progress on vaccinations and an easing of supply constraints."
"In their discussion of the household sector, participants remarked that demand for most consumer goods had remained strong."
 They noted that businesses had generally recorded robust sales despit e labor shortages and other supply disruptions that had prevented them from fully meeting higher demand for their products.
" Participants interpreted available data as suggesting that the spread of the Delta variant had slowed the shift of consumer demand toward purchases of services and away from spending on goods, stretching out the full reopening of the economy and intensifying supply and demand imbalances."
" A number of participants noted that there was likely to be a drag on household spending as previous fiscal support  faded , or that fiscal policy might provide some support to aggregate demand if the Congress authorized major new federal appropriations."
" Bottleneck pressures faced by businesses were accompanied by gl obal supply chain disruptions associated with major backlogs in shipments and transportation as well as surging demand for a variety of goods, shortages of labor and other inputs, increases in costs of production, and depleted inventory levels in key sectors."
" Although the September increase in payrolls had been moderate compared with recent months, the unemployment rate had declined further and previous months’ job growth had been revised up."
"  While recognizing that labor market conditions varied significantly across the country, some participants cited a number of signs that the U.S. labor market was very tight:  These included data on quits, job availability, and stronger rates of nominal wage growth reflected in the recent rise in the employment cost index, as well as the readings provided by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City’s Labor Market Cond itions Indicators."
 Participants generally saw th e current elevated level of inflation as largely reflecting factors that were likely to be transitory but judged that inflation pressures could take longer to subside than they had previously assessed.
" They remarked that the Delta wave had intensified the impediments to supply chains and had helped sustain the high level of goods demand, adding to the upward pressure on prices."
" Participants also observed that increases in energy prices, stronger rates of nominal wage growth, and higher housing rental costs had been forces adding to inflation."
" Although participants expected signif icant inflation pressures to last for longer than they pr eviously expected, they generally continued to anticipate that the inflation rate would diminish significantly during 2022 as supply and demand imbalances abated."
 Many participants pointed to considerations that might suggest that elevated inflation could prove more persistent.
" These participants noted that average inflation already exceeded 2 percent when measured on a multiyear basis and cited a number of factors—such as businesses’ enhanced scope to  pass on higher costs to their customers, the possibility that nominal wage growth had become more sensitive to labor market pressures, or accommodative financial conditions—that might result in inflation cont inuing at elevated levels."
" Some other participants, however, remarked that although inflationary pressures were lasting longer than anticipated, those pressures continued to reflect the same pandemicrelated imbalances and would likely abate when supply constraints eased."
" These participants also noted that the most sizable price increases may have already occurred, that there was as yet little evidence of a change in inflation dyna mics—such as the development of a wage–price spiral—that would tend to prolong elevated levels of inflation, and that forces already in motion would likely bring inflation down toward 2 percent over the medium term."
"In their comments on inflation expectations, a number of participants discussed the risk that, in light of recent elevated levels of inflation, the public’s longerterm expectations of inflation migh t increase to a level above that consistent with the Committee’s longerrun inflation objective; such a development could make it harder for the Committee to achieve 2 percent inflation over the longer run."
 A couple of participants pointed to increases in surveyand marketbased indicators of expected inflation—including the notable rise in the fiveyear TIPSbased measure of inflation compensation—as possible signs that inflation expectations were becoming less well anchored.
"  Several other participants, however, remarked that measures of nearand mediumterm inflation expectations typically had been sensitive to movements in realized inflation and that they had not exhibited greater sensitivity recently."
" They additionally pointed out that  indicators of longerterm inflation expectations—including the fiveyear, fiveyear-forward measure of inflation compensation—continued to display less sensitivity to real ized inflation and remained well anchored at levels consistent with the Committee’s longerrun 2 percent goal."
" Participants cited upside risks to inflation, including those associated with strong demand for goods and a tight labor market."
 Upside risks to economic activity included a potential nearterm boost to aggregate demand that could arise from the drawing down of the substantial savings accumulated by households since the beginning of the pandemic.
" A few participants mentioned an upsurge in COVID19 cases during the coming winter or an emergence of new virus strains as possibilities that, if they were  realized, would damp economic activity and intensify price pressures."
"In their consideration of the stance of monetary policy, participants agreed that the economy had made substantial further progress toward the Committee’s goals since December 2020, when the Committee adopted its guidance regarding asset purchases."
" The unemployment rate had declined to 4.8 percent in September—about 2 percentage points lower than the level last December—and job openings and other indicators also were pointing to widespread strength in labor demand, consistent with a broad improvement in labor market conditions."
" Consequently, participants assessed that the criterion of substantial further progress had been met with regard to the Committee’s maximum employment goal."
" In addition, participants generally judged  that the Committee’s criterion of substantial further progress had clearly been more than met with respect to inflation."
" Some participants suggested that reducing the pace of net asset purcha ses by more than $15 billion each month could be warranted so that the Committee would be in a better position to make adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, particularly in light of inflation pressures."
 Various participants noted that the Committee should be prep ared to adjust the pace of asset purchases and raise the target range for the federal funds rate sooner than participants currently anticipated if inflation continued to run higher than levels consistent with the Committee’s objectives.
" At the same time, because of the continuing considerable uncertainty about developments in supply chains, production logistics, and the course of the virus, a number of participants stressed that a patient attitude toward incoming data remained appropriate to allow for careful evaluation of evolving supply chain developments and their implications for the labor market and inflation."
" That said, participants noted that the Committee would not hesitate to take appropriate actions to address inflation pressures that posed risks to its longerrun price stability and employment objectives."
"Committee Policy Action  In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that with progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment had continue d to strengthen."
" Inflation was elevated, largely reflecting factors that were expected to be transitory."
 They remarked that supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic and the reopening of the economy had contributed to sizable price increases in some sectors.
" Progress on vaccinations and an easing of supply constraints were expected to support continued gains in economic activity and employment as well as a reduction in inflation, but risks to the economic outlook remained."
" They also concurred that it _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of November 2–3, 2021Page 9  would be appropriate to convey less certainty about the path of inflation by noting that the factors driving elevated inflation “are expected to be transitory.”  In order to provide additional information about these factors, members further decided th at the postmeeting statement would say that “supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic and the reopening of the economy have contributed to sizable price increases in some sectors.”  Members also agreed to include a sentence stating that “progress on vaccinations and an easing of supply constraints are expected to support continued gains in economic activity and employment as well as a reduction in inflation.” Members agreed that the Federal Reserve was committed to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum employment and price stability goals."
" All members reaffirmed that, in  accordance with the Committee’s goals to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run, and with inflation having run pers istently below this longerrun goal, they would aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longerterm inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent."
 Members expected to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until those outcomes were achieved.
"In their discussion of monetary policy in the period ahead, members agreed that, in light of the substantial further progress the economy had made toward the Committee’s goals since last December, the Committee should begin to slow the pace of its asset purchases at this meeting."
 Members agreed that the addition of this language would acknowledge the importance of maintaining flexibility to adjust the stance of policy as appropriate in response to changes in the Committee’s outlook for the labor market and inflation.
"Members agreed that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and that they would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate in the event that risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals."
" They also concurred that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments."
" Engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary  to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve’s agency MBS transactions.” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2:00 p.m.: “The Federal Reserve is committed to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time , thereby promoting its maximum employment and price stability goals."
"With progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have continued to strengthen."
" Inflation is elevated, largely reflecting factors that are expected to be transitory."
 Supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic and the reopening of the economy have contributed to sizable price increases in some sectors.
 Progress on vaccinations and an easing of supply constraints are expected to support continued gains in economic activity and employment as well as a reduction in inflation.
The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run.
" With inflation having run persistently below this longerrun goal, the Committee will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longerterm inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent."
 The Committee expects to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomes are achieved.
 The Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessments of maximum  employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.
"In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of in coming information for the economic outlook."
 The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals.
" The Committee’s assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financia l and international developments.” Voting for this action:   Jerome H."
"Consistent with the Committee’s decision to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the Board voted unanimously to maintain the interest rate paid on reserve balances at 0.15 percent, effective November 4, 2021."
