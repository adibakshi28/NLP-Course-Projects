 4 Attended through the discussion of monetary policy options at the effective lower bound.
"Lee Smith, Senior Economist, Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City   Brent Meyer, Policy Advisor and Economist, Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta   Cristina Arellano, Monetary Advisor, Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis   Monetary Policy Options at the Effective Lower Bound  The staff provided a briefing that summarized its analysis of the extent to which some of the Committee’s monetary policy tools could provide adequate policy accommodation if, in future economic downturns , the policy rate were again to become constrained by the effective lower bound (ELB).5  The staff examined simulations from the staff’s FRB /US model and various other economic models  to assess the likelihood of the policy rate returning to the ELB and to evaluate how much additional policy accommodation could be delivered by the current toolkit ."
" This toolkit  included thresholdbased forwardguidance policies, in which the Committee communicates that the federal funds rate will remain at the ELB until either inflation or the unemployment rate reaches a certain threshold, and balance sheet policies, involving increases in the size or duration of the Fed eral Reserve’s asset holdings."
 That analysis also implied that threshold -based forward guidance and balance sheet actions could provide additional accommodation that could help support economic activity and mitigate disinflationary pressures in these episodes.
" In the model sim ulations, because of unanticipated shocks and lags in the transmission of the effects of monetary policy actions on economic activity and inflation, the effectiveness of monetary policy in general, including forward-guidance and balance sheet  policies, was limited in mitigating the initial downturn in the economy ."
 Many participants commented on the monetary policy implications of the apparent secular decl ine in neutral real interest rates.
" That decline was viewed as likely driven by various factors, including slower trend growth of the labor force and productivity as well as increased deman d for safe assets."
" In such circumstances , those participants saw monetary policy as having less scope than in the past to reduce the federal funds rate in response to negative shocks."
" Moreover, the secular decline in interest rates was a global phenomenon, and a couple of participants emphasize d that this decline increased the likelihood that the ELB could bind simultaneously in a number of  countries."
" A few other participants raised the concern that frequent or extended ELB episodes could result in expectations for inflation that were below the Committee’s symmetric 2  percent objective, further limiting the scope for reductions in  the federal funds rate to serve as a buffer for the economy and increasing the likelihood of ELB episodes."
" Fiscal policy was viewed as a potentially important tool in addressing a future economic downturn in which monetary policy was constrained by the ELB; however, countercyclical fiscal policy actions in the United States may be constrained by  the high and rising level of federal government debt."
"  In the Addendum to the Policy Normalization Principles and Plans  statement issued in June 2017, the Committee indicated  that it would be prepared to use its full range of tools, including altering the size and composition of its balance sheet, if future economic conditions were to warrant a more accommodative monetary policy than can be achieved solely by reducing the federal funds rate."
 Several participants indicated that it would be desirable to hold  periodic and systematic reviews in which the Committee assessed the strengths and weaknesses of its current monetary policy framework.
" Asset prices were influenced by a number of factors, including reports concerning trade tensions among the United States and its major trading partners, foreign monetary policy developments, and data pointing to strong growth momentum in the United States."
 The Japanese yield curve steepened following reports that the B OJ may facilitate an increase in long erterm interest rates .
" At its July  meeting, the BOJ announced a number of changes with respect to forward guidance on its policy outlook, including its intention to keep interest rates low for an extended period ."
" Meanwhile, expectations concerning the path of monetary policy in the United States were little changed over the intermeeting period."
" Over the days followin g the June FOMC meeting, the effective federal funds rate (EFFR) moved up relative to the IOER  rate, reportedly reflecting some special factors in the federal funds market , including increased demand for overnight funding by banks in connection with liquid ity regulation s and a pullback by Federal Home Loan Banks in their lending in the federal funds market."
" Consumer price inflation, as measured by the 12month percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), remained near 2 percent in June."
 Survey -based measures of longerrun inflation expectations were little changed on balance.
 Total nonfarm payroll employment expanded at a strong pace again in June.
" The national unemployment rate moved up to 4.0  percent, but the labor force participation rate rose by a similar amount, leaving the employment-topopulation ratio unchanged from May."
" The threemonth moving  averages of the unemployment rates for African Americans, Asians, and Hispanics were each at or below the lows a chieved during the previous expansion."
" The rate of privatesector job openings ticked down in May but remained elevated, while the rate of quits moved higher; initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits continued to be low through mid -July."
" The employment cost index for private workers  increased 2.9  percent over the 12 months ending in June (compared with 2.4  percent over the same 12 months a year earlier), and average hourly earnings for all employees rose 2.7  percent over that period (compared with Page 4                                                                                                                                                                              _Federal Open Market Committee2.5 percent over the same 12 months a year earlier)."
" Light motor vehicle sales maintained a robust pace in June, and indicators of vehicle demand were mixed but generally favorable."
" More broadly, recent readings on key factors that influence consumer spending —including gains in employment, real disposable personal income, and households’ net worth—continued to be supportive of solid real PCE growth in the near term."
" The nominal U.S. international trade deficit narrowed in May, as exports, led by ag ricultural products (particularly soybeans) and capital goods, increased strongly and imports increased only modestly."
" All told, the BEA estimate s that net exports made a positive contribution of about  1 percentage point to real GDP growth in the second quarter after a near -zero contribution in the first."
" Core PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in consumer food and energy prices, was 1.9 percent over that same period."
" The consumer price index (CPI) rose 2.9 percent  over the 12 months ending in June, while core CPI inflation was 2.3  percent."
 Recent readings on survey -based measures of longer -run inflation expectations —including those from the Michigan survey and the Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants —were little changed on balance.
Incoming data suggested that foreign economic activity expanded at a moderate pace in the second quarter.
  Monthly indicators pointed to a pickup in the pace of economic activity in most advanced foreign economies (AFEs) following a temporary dip in the first quarter.
"  However, real GDP growth remained moderate in the euro area and appeared to have slowed notably in many emerging market economies (EMEs), especially Mexico, from an unusually strong start to the year."
"  Foreign inflation fell in the second q uarter, largely reflecting lower retail energy and food price inflation."
"  Underlying inflation pressures in most foreign economies, especially in some AFEs, remained subdued."
 Financing conditions for nonfinancial businesses and households remained supportive of economic activity on balance.
 Measures of inflation compensation derived from Treasury InflationProtected Securities were little changed on net.
 The BOJ issued revised forward guidance at its July meeting indicating that it intends to maintain current low short - and longterm interest rates for an extended period.
"  Finally, the Bank of England held its policy rate steady at  its June meeting, but U.K. yields declined slightly amid ongoing Brexit -related concerns as well as lower -thanexpected inflation data."
" Growth of outstanding commercial and industrial (C&I) loans held by banks was strong , on average, in June."
" CRE loans at banks maintained solid growth over the past several quarters, with growth shared across all three major CRE loan categories."
" On a weighted basis across all major CRE loan categories, respondents to the June SLOOS reported that standards and demand for CRE loans continued to be unchanged , on the whole , over the second quarter."
" Interest rate spreads on commercial mortgageb acked securities (CMBS) were little changed over the intermeeting period and remained near their post -crisis lows, while issuance of nonagency and agency CMBS maintained a solid pace in the second quarter."
" Growth in home -purchase mortgages slowed a bit, and refinancing a ctivity continued to be muted over the past year, with both developments partly reflecting the rise in mortgage rates earlier this year."
" Relative to the June FOMC meeting, interest rates on 30 -year conforming mortgages and yields on agency MBS were little  changed."
"Financing conditions in consumer credit markets were little changed so far this year , on balance, and remained largely supportive of growth in household spending."
 Growth in consumer credit picked up in May from the more moderate pace seen earlier this year.
" Despite rising interest rates, financing rates remained low compared with historical levels , and recent household surveys indicated that consumers’ assessments of buying conditions for autos and other expensive durable goods were generally positive."
" Over the 2018–20 period, output was projected to rise further above the staff’s estimate of potential output, and the unemployment rate was projected to decline further below the staff’s estimate of the longer -run natural rate."
" However, with labor market conditions already tight, the staff continued to assume that the projected decline in the unemployment rate will be attenuated by a greaterthan-usual cyclical improvement in the labor force participation rate."
" Relative to the forecast prepared for the June meeting, the projection for real GDP growth was revised up a little, primarily in response to stronger incoming data on household spending."
" In addition, the staff continued to anticipate that supply constraints might restrain output growth somewhat in the medium term."
" The unemployment rate was projected to be a little higher over the next few quarters than in the previous forecast, but it was essentially unrevised thereafter."
"The staff forecast for total PCE price inflation in 2018 was revised down a little, mainly because of a slower -thanexpected increase in consumer energy prices in the second quarter and a downward revision to the forecast for energy price inflation in the second half of this year."
 The staff continued to project that total PCE inflation would remain near the Committee’s 2  percent objective over the medium term and that core PCE price inflation would run slightly higher than total inflation over that period because of a projected decline in consumer energy prices in 2019 and 2020.
" The staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inf lation as similar to the average of the past 20 years."
 The staff saw the risks to the forecasts for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate as balanced.
" On the downside, trade policies could move in a direction that would have significant negative effects on economic growth."
" Another possibility was that recent fiscal Minutes of the Meeting of July 31–August 1, 2018_                                                                                                                                                                              Page 7policy actions could produce less of a boost to aggregate demand than assumed in the baseline projection, as the current tightness of resource utilization may result in smaller multiplier effects than would be typical at other points in the business cycle."
 Risks to the inflation projection also were seen as balanced.
 The upside risk that inflation could increase more than expected in an economy that was projected to move further above its potential was counterbalanced by the downside risk that longerterm infla tion expectations may be lower than was assumed in the staff forecast.
" Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook  In their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, m eeting participants agreed that  information received since the FOMC met in June indicated that the labor market ha d continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising at a strong rate."
" Job gains had been strong, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate ha d stayed low."
" On a 12month basis, both overall inflation and core inflation, which excludes changes in food and energy prices, had remained near 2  percent."
" Indicators of longerterm inflation expectations were little changed, on balance."
 Participants generally noted that economic growth in the second quarter had been strong ; incoming data indicated considerable momentum in spending by households and businesses .
" Several participants stressed the possibility  that real GDP growth in the second quarter may have been boosted by  transitory factors, including  an outsized increase in U.S. exports."
" For the second half  of the year, participants generally expected that GDP growth would likely slow from its second -quarter rate but would still exceed that of potential output."
" Participants noted a number of favorable economic factors that were supporting above -trend GDP growth; these included a strong labor market, stimulative federa l tax and spending policies, accommodative financial conditions, and continued high levels of household and business confidence."
" Although the unemployment rate increased slightly in June, this increase was accompanied by an uptick  in the labor force participation rate."
 Many participants commented on the fact that measures of aggregate nominal wage growth  had so far picked up only modestly .
" Among the factors cited as containing the pickup in wage growth  were low trend productivity growth, lags in the response of  nominal wage  growth to resource pressures, and improvem ents in the terms of employment that were not recorded  in the wage data ."
" Alternatively,  the recent pace of  nominal wage growth might indicate continued slack in the labor market."
" However, some participants expected a pickup in aggregate nominal wage growth to occur before long , with a number of participants reporting that wage pressures in their Districts were rising or that firms now exhibited greater willingness to grant wage increases ."
Participants noted that both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy remained near 2 percent on a 12month basis.
 A few participants expressed increased confidence that the recent return of inflation to near the Committee’s longer -term 2 percent objective would  be sustained .
" Several participants commented that increases in the prices of particular goods , such as those induced by the tariff increases , would likely Page 8                                                                                                                                                                              _Federal Open Market Committeebe one source of short -term upward pressure on the inflation rate, although offsetting influences —including the negative  effects that trade developments  were having on agricultural prices —were also noted ."
" Reports from several Districts suggested that firms had greater  scope than in the recent past to raise prices in response to  strong demand or increases in input costs, including those associated with tariff increases and recent rises in fuel and freight expenses ."
" Many participants anticipated that, over the medium term, high levels of resource  utilization and stable inflation expectations would keep inflation near 2  percent."
" However, some participants observed that inflation in recent years had shown only a weak connection to measures of  resource pressures  or indicated that they would like to see further evidence that measures of  underlying inflation or readings on  inflation expectations were on course to attain levels consistent with sustained achievement of the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent inflation objective."
" Although a  few participants observed that the trimmed  mean measure of inflation calculated by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas was still below 2 percent, a couple  noted forecasts that this measure would reach 2 percent by the end of the year."
 Some participants raised the concern that a prolonged period in which the economy operated beyond potential could give rise to inflationary pressures  or to financial imbalances that could eventually trigger an economic downturn.
" Participants commented on a number of risks and uncertainties associated with their outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation over the medium term."
 They generally continued to see fiscal policy and the strengthening of the labor market as supportive of economic growth in the near term.
" Participants observed that if a largescale and prolonged dispute over trade policies developed, there would likely be adverse effects on business sentiment , investment spending, and employment ."
 Further negative effects in such a scenario could include reductions in productivity and disruption s of supply chains.
" In their consideration of monetary policy, participants discussed the implications of recent economic and financial developments for the economic outlook and the associated risks to that outlook."
 Participants remarked on recent above -trend growth in real GDP and on indicators of resource utilization.
" Participants ge nerally characterized  inflation as running close to the Committee’s objec tive of 2 percent, and most of those who expressed a view indicated that recent readings on inflation had come in close to their expectations."
" Consistent with their SEP submissions in June, Minutes of the Meeting of July 31–August 1, 2018_                                                                                                                                                                              Page 9several participants re marked that inflation , measured on a 12month basis, was likely to move modestly above  the Committee’s objective for a time ."
 Others pointed to some indicators suggesting that long -term inflation expectations could be below levels consistent with the Committee’s 2  percent inflation objective.
" Participants generally judged that the current stance of monetary policy remained accommodative, supporting strong labor market conditions and inflation of around 2 percent."
" Participants generally expected that further gradual increases in the target range for the federal f unds rate would be consistent with a sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee’s symmetric 2  percent objective over the medium term."
" Some participants suggested that , in the event of a major escalation in trade disputes , the complex nature of trade issues , including the entire range of their effects on output and inflation, presented a challenge in determining the appropriate monetary policy response."
Participants also discussed the possible implications of a flattening in the term structure of market interest rates.
" A number of global factors were seen as contributing to downward pressure on term premiums,  including central bank asset purchase programs and the strong worldwide demand for safe assets ."
" A couple of participants commented on issues related to  the operating framework for the implementation of monetary policy , including, among other things, the implications of changes in financial market regulations for the demand for reserves and  for the size and composition of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet."
 Many participants noted that it would likely be appropriate in the nottoo-distant future to revise the Committee’s characterization of the stance of monetary policy  in its postmeeting statement.
" They agreed that the statement’s language that “the s tance of monetary policy remains accommodative” would , at some point fairly soon, no longer be appropriate ."
"  Committee Policy Action  In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that information received since the FOMC met in June indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising at a strong rate."
" Job g ains had been strong, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate had stayed low."
" On a Page 10                                                                                                                                                                              _Federal Open Market Committee12month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and ene rgy remained near 2  percent."
" Indicators of longer -term inflation expectations were little changed, on balance."
" Consequently, members expected that further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would be consistent with sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective over the medium term."
" After assessing the incoming data, current conditions , and the outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, members agreed to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1¾  to 2 percent."
" They noted that the stance of monetary policy remained accommodative, thereby supporting strong labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2  percent inflation."
Members agreed that the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate would depend on their assessments of realized and expected economic conditions relative to the objectives of maximum employment and 2  percent inflation.
" They reiterated that this assessment would take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
 The Committee also directs the Desk to engage in dollar r oll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve’s agency mortgage -backed securities transactions.”  The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00  p.m.: “Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in June indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising at a strong rate.
" Job gains have been strong, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has stayed low."
" On a 12month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy remain near 2  percent."
" Indicators of longer -term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance."
"Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
" The Committee expects that further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be consis tent with sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee’s symmetric 2  percent objective over the medium term."
" In view of realized and expec ted labor market conditions and inflation, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1¾ to 2  percent."
" The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, Minutes of the Meeting of July 31–August 1, 2018_                                                                                                                                                                              Page 11thereby supporting strong labor market conditions and a susta ined return to 2 percent  inflation."

" This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and i nternational developments.”  Voting for this action:   Jerome H."
" Consistent with the Committee’s decision to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the Board of Governors voted unanimously to leave the interest rates on required and excess reserve balances unchanged at 1.95 percent and voted unanimously to approve establishment of the primary credit rate (discount rate) at the existing level of 2½  percent, effective August 2, 2018.6  It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday –Wednesday, September  25–26, 2018."
Clouse  Secretary                                                  6 The second vote of the Board also encompassed approval of the establishment of the interest rates for secondary and seasonal credit under the existing formulas for computing suc h rates.
