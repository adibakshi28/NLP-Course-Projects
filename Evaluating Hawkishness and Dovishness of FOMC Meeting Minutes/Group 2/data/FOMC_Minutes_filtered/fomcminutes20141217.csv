"   Page 2Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________Following the discussion of the extension of ON RRP test operations, the Committee unanimously approved the following resolution: “The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) authorizes the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to conduct a series of overnight reverse repurchase operations involving U.S. government securities for the purpose of further assessing the appropriate structure of such operations in supporting the implementation of monetary policy during normal ization."
 Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information reviewed for the December 16 –17 meeting suggested that economic activity was increasing at a moderate pace in the fourth quarter and that labor market conditions had improved further.
" Consumer price inflation continued to run below the FOMC’s longerrun objective of 2 percent, partly restrained by declining energy prices."
" Marketbased measures of inflation compensation moved lower, but survey measures of longerrun inflation expectations remained stable."
Total nonfarm payroll employment expanded in October and November at a faster pace than in the third quarter.
 The unemployment rate edged down to 5.8 percent in October and remained at that level in November.
" Both the labor force participation rate and the employment- topopulation ratio rose slightly, and the share of workers employed part time for economic reasons declined."
 Key factors that influence household spending pointed toward further solid PCE growth.
"The U.S. international trade deficit was little changed in October, as exports and imports both rose ."
" But with the October deficit remaining wider than the monthly average in the third quarter, real net exports looked to be declining in the fourth quarter."
" Both total U.S. consumer price inflation, as measured by the PCE price index, and core inflation, as measured by PCE prices excluding food and energy, were about      1½ percent over the 12 months ending in October; consumer energy prices declined, while consumer food prices rose more than overall prices."
" Over the                  12 months ending in November, total inflation as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) was 1¼ percent, partly reflecting the further decline in energy prices, while core CPI inflation was 1¾ percent."
" Measures of expected longrun inflation from a variety of surveys, including the Michigan survey, the Blue Chip Economic Indicators, the Survey of Professional Forecasters, and the Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers, remained stable."
" In contrast, marketbased measures of inflation compensation moved lower."
 Simil ar  rates of increase were observed for the employment cost index over the same yearlong period and for average hourly earnings for all employees over the 12 months ending in November.
Overall growth in foreign real gross domestic product (GDP) remained subdued in the third quarter.
" In the emerging market economies, economic growth slowed in Mexico in the third quarter and remained sluggish in Brazil; economic growth in China likely slowed moderately in the fourth quarter."
" O il prices continued to decline, likely reflecting favorable supply developments as well as some weakening in global demand."
" Inflation in the advanced foreign economies remained quite low during the intermeeting period, partly because of the fall in oil prices."
" Declining oil prices had a smaller effect on inflation in the emerging market economies, reflecting the greater prevalence of administered energy prices."
 The sharp decline in oil prices weighed on inflation compensation and left a mixed imprint on other asset markets.
" In addition, investors appeared to read the October FOMC statement as suggesting a slightly less accommodative path for future monetary policy than they had previously expect ed."
" Measures of inflation compensation based on Treasury InflationProtected Securities and on inflation swaps decreased, reportedly reflecting, in part, the decline in oil prices and increased concerns about global economic growth."
" Interest rates on 30year fixedrate mortgages declined, consistent with the moves in longerterm Treasury yields."
"Reflecting divergen t economic and monetary policy  prospects in the United States and abroad, the dollar appreciated substantially against most currencies over the intermeeting period."
" Over the period, market participants seemed to conclude that monetary policy in Europe was likely to be put on a more accommodative path, and 10year yields in Germany and the United Kingdom declined further."
"Staff Economic Outlook In the staff forecast prepared for the December FOMC meeting, real GDP growth in the second half of 2014 was higher than in the projection for the October meeting, largely reflecting strongerthan-expected data for PCE."
" Nevertheless, real GDP growth was anticipated to slow in the fourth quarter as both net exports and federal government purchases —important positive contributors to real GDP growth in the third quarter —were anticipated to drop back."
 The staff’s medium -term forecast for real GDP growth was revised up a little on net.
" And although the projected path of the dollar was revised up, the staff revised down its estimate of how much the appreciation of the dollar since last summer would restrain projected growth in real GDP."
" The staff continued to forecast that real GDP would expand at a faster pace in 2015 and 2016 than it had this year and that it would rise more quickly than potential output, supported by increases in consumer and business confidence and a pickup in foreign economic growth, along with monetary policy that was assumed to remain highly accommodative for some time."
" In 2017, real GDP growth was projected to begin slowing toward, but to remain above, the rate of potential output growth as the normalization of monetary policy was assumed to proceed."
" The expansion in economic activity over the medium term was anticipated to slowly reduce resource slack, and the unemployment rate was expected to decline gradually and to temporarily Minutes of the Meeting of December 16–17, 2014Page 5_____________________________________________________________________________________________move slightly below the staff’s estimate o f its longerrun natural rate."
" The staff’s forecast for inflation in the near term was revised down to reflect the further large energy price declines since the October FOMC meeting, which were anticipated to lead to a temporary decrease in the total PCE price index late this year and early next year."
" The staff’s inflation projection for the next few years was essentially unchanged; the staff continued to project that inflation would move up gradually toward, but run somewhat below, the Committee’s longer -run objective of 2 percent."
" Nevertheless, inflation was projected to reach the Committee’s objective over time, with longerrun inflation expectations assumed to remain stable, prices of energy and nonoil imports forecast to begin rising next year , and slack in labor and product markets anticipated to diminish slowly."
"  The staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as similar to the average over the past 20 years."
" The risks to the forecast for real GDP growth and inflation were viewed as tilted a little to the downside, reflecting the staff’s assessment that neither monetary policy nor fiscal policy w as well positioned to help the economy withstand adverse shocks."
" At the same time, the staff viewed the risks around its outlook for the unemployment rate as roughly balanced."
"Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, members of the Board of Governors and the Federal Reserve Bank presidents submitted their projections of the most like ly outcomes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, inflation, and the federal funds rate for each year from 2014 through 2017 and over the longer run, conditional on each participant ’s judgment of appropriate monetary policy."
" The longerrun projections represent each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy."
" Labor market conditions improved further, with solid job gains and a lower unemployment rate; participants judged that the underutilization of labor resources was continuing to diminish."
" Participants expected that, over the medium term, real economic activity would increase at a pace sufficient to lead to further improvements in labor market indicators toward levels consistent with the Committee’s  objective of maximum employment."
" Inflation was continuing to run below the Committee’s longer -run objective , reflecting in part continued reductions in oil prices and falling import prices."
" Marketbased measures of inflation compensation declined further, while surveybased measures of longerterm inflation expectations remained stable."
 Participants generally anticipated that inflation would rise gradually toward the Committee’s 2 percent objective as the labor market improved further and the transitory effects of lower energy prices and other factors dissipated.
 The risks to the outlook for economic activity and the labor market were seen as nearly balanced.
 So me participants suggested that the recent domestic economic data had increased their confidence in the outlook for growth going forward.
 Participants generally regarded the net effect of the recent decline in energy prices as likely to be positive for economic activity and employment.
" However, many of them thought that a further deterioration in the foreign economic situation could result in slower domestic economic growth than they currently expect ed."
"  Participants also cited solid gains in payroll employment, low interest rates, and the decline in levels of household debt relative to inc ome as factors that were expected to support continued growth in consumer spending."
"  In their discussion of the foreign economic outlook, participants noted that the implications of the drop in crude oil prices would differ across regions, especially if the price declines affected inflation expectations and financial markets; a few participants said that the effect on overseas employment and output as a whole was likely to be positive."
" While some participants had lowered their assessments of the prospects for global economic growth, several noted that the likelihood of further responses by policymakers abroad had increased."
" Several participants indicated that they expected slower economic growth abroad to negatively affect the U.S. economy, principally through lower net exports, but the net effect of lower oil prices on U.S. economic activity was anticipated to be positive."
"Participants saw broadbased improvement in labor market conditions over the intermeeting period , including solid gai ns in payroll employment, a slight reduction in the unemployment rate, and increases in the rates of hiring and quits."
" These favorable trends notwithstanding, the levels of these measures suggested to some participants that there remain ed more labor market slac k than was indicated by the unemployment rate alone."
" However, a few others continued to view the unemployment rate as a reliable indicator of overall labor market conditions and saw a narrower degree of labor underutilization remaining."
" Although a few participants suggested that the recent uptick in the employment cost index or average hourly earnings could be a tentative sign of an upturn in wage growth, most participants saw no clear evidence of a broadbased acceleration in wages."
"  A couple of participants, however, pointing to the weak statistical relationship between wage inflation and labor market conditions, suggested that the pace of wage inflation was providing relatively little information about the degree of labor underutilization."
"  Participants generally anticipated that inflation was likely to decline further in the near term, reflecting the reduction in oil prices and the effects of the rise in the foreign exchange value of the dollar on import prices."
  Most participants saw these influences as temporary and thus continued to expect inflation to move back gradually to the Co mmittee’s 2 percent longerrun objective a s the labor market improved further in an environment of wellanchored inflation expectations.
"  Surveybased measures of longerterm inflation expectations remained stable , although marketbased measures of inflation compensation over the next five years, as well as over the fiveyear period beginning five years ahead, moved down further over the intermeeting period."
"  Participants discussed various explanations for the decline in marketbased measures, including a fall in expected future inflation, reductions in inflation risk premiums, and higher liquidity and other premiums that might be influencing the prices of Treasury InflationProtected Securities and inflation derivatives."
"  Modelbased decompositions of inflation compensation seemed to support the message from surveys that long erterm inflation expectations had remained stable, although it was observed that these results were sensitive to the assumptions underlying the particular models used."
" It was noted that even if the declines in inflation compensation reflected lower inflation risk premiums rather than a reduction in expected inflation, policymakers might still want to take them into account because such changes could reflect increased concerns on the part of investors about adverse outcomes in which low inflation was accompanied by weak economic activity."
" In the end, participants generally agreed that it would take more time and analysis to draw definitive conclusions regarding the recent behavior of inflation compensation."
" In their discussion of financial market developments , participants observed that movements in asset prices over the intermeeting period appeared to have been importantly influenced by concerns about prospects for foreign economic growth and by associated expectations of monetary policy actions in Europe and Japan."
  A couple of participants remarked on the apparent disparity between marketbased measures of expected future U.S. shortterm interest rates and projections for shortterm rates based on surveys or based on the median of federal funds rate projections in the SEP.
" Another possibility was that marketbased measures might be a ssigning considerable weight to less favorable outcomes for the U.S. economy in which the federal funds rate would remain low for quite some time or fall back to very low levels in the future, whereas the projections in the SEP report the paths for the federal funds rate that Minutes of the Meeting of December 16–17, 2014Page 7_____________________________________________________________________________________________participants s ee as appropriate given their views of the most likely evolution of inflation and real activity."
" Many participants regarded the international situation as an important source of downside risks to domestic real activity and employment, particularly if declines in oil prices and the persistence of weak economic growth abroad had a substantial negative effect on global financial markets or if foreign policy responses were insufficient."
" Several participants, pointing to indicators of consumer and business confidence as well as to the solid record of payroll employment gains in 2014, suggested that the real economy may end up showing more momentum than anticipated, while a few others thought that the boost to domestic spending coming from lower energy prices could turn out to be quite large."
" With regard to inflation, a number of participants saw a risk that it could run persistently below their 2 percent objective , with some expressing concern that such an outcome could undermine the credibility of the Committee’s commitment to that objective."
" Some participants were worried that the recent substantial fall in energy prices could lead to a reduction in longerterm inflation expectations, while others were concerned that the decline in marketbased measures of inflation compensation might reflect, in part, that such a decline had already begun."
" However, a couple of others noted that if the unemployment rate continued to decline quickly, wage and price inflation could rise more than generally anticipated."
"  Most participants agreed that it would be useful to stat e that the Committee judges that it can be patient in beginning to normalize the stance of monetary policy; they noted that such language would provide more flexibility to adjust policy in response to incoming information than the previous language, which had tied the beginning of normalization to the end of the asset purchase program."
 Participants generally stressed the need to communicate that the timing of the first increase in the federal funds rate would depend on the incoming data and their implications for the Committee’s assessment of progress toward its objectives of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent.
" With lower energy prices and the stronger dollar likely to keep inflation below target for some time, it was noted that the Committee might begin normalization at a time when core inflation was near current levels, although in that circumstance participants would want to be reasonably confident that inflation will move back toward 2 percent over time."
"  Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that information received since the FOMC met in October indicated that economic activity was expanding at a moderate pace."
"  Labor market conditions had improved further, with solid job gains and a lower unemployment rate; taken as a whole, labor market indicators suggested that the underutilization of labor resources was continuing to diminish."
"  Inflation had continued to run below the Committee’s longer -run objective, in part reflecting declines in energy prices ."
" Marketbased Page 8Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________measures of inflation compensation had declined somewhat further , but surveybased measures of longerterm inflation expectations had remained stable."
" The Committee expected that, with appropriate monetary policy accommodation, economic activity would continue to expand at a moderate pace, with labor market indicators moving toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate."
 The Committee also expected that inflation would rise gradually toward 2 percent as the labor market improves further and the transitory effects of lower energy prices and other factors dissipate.
" In addition, they decided that the statement should note that the low level of inflation seen of late partly reflected the recent decline in energy prices."
 The Committee modified the previous statement language to make clear that it expects that inflation will rise gradually toward       2 percent as the labor market improves further and the transitory effects of lower energy prices and other factors dissipate.
" Given the uncertainties about the outlook for inflation, members decided that it would be appropriate to indicate that the Committee continues to monitor inflation developments closely."
 The Committee agreed to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and to reaffirm the indication in the statement that the Committee’ s decision about how long to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate would depend on its assessment of actual and expected progress toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.
  Most members agreed to update the Committee’s forward guidance  with language indicating that it judges that it can be patient in beginning to normalize the stance of monetary policy.
" In order to avoid the misinterpretation that this new wording reflected a change in the Committee’s policy intentions, the statement included a sentence indicating that the Committee sees this guidance as consistent with its previous statement that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the 0 to 1/4 percent target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time following the end of its asset purchase program in October, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee ’s 2 percent longerrun goal, and provided that longerterm inflation expectations remain well anchored."
"  Two members thought that this forward guidance did not take sufficient account of the progress that had been made toward the Committee’s objectives, while one wanted to strengthen the forward guidance in order to underscore the Committee ’s commitment to its 2 percent inflation objective."
" Members agreed that their policy decisions would remain data dependent, and they continued to include wording in the statement noting that if incoming information indicates faster progress toward the Committee’s employment and inflation objectives than the Committee now expects, then increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would likely occur sooner than currently anticipated, and, similarly, that if progress proves slower than expected, then increases in the target range would likely occur later than currently anticipated."
" Finally, the Committee also decided to reiterate its expectation that, even after employment and inflation are near mandateconsistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run."
"  At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: “Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster maximum employment and price stability."
 The System Open Market Account manager and the secretary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the System’s balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the Committee’s objectives of maximum employment and price stability.
” The vote encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p.m.: “Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in October suggests that economic activity is expanding at a moderate pace.
" Labor market conditions improved further, with solid job gains and a lower unemployment rate."
" Inflation has continued to run below the Committee’s longer -run objective, partly reflecting declines in energy prices."
 Marketbased measures of inflation compensation have declined somewhat further; surveybased measures of longerterm inflation expectations have remained stable.
"Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
" The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, with labor market indicators moving toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate."
 The Committee sees the risks to the outlook for economic activity and the labor market as nearly balanced.
 The Committee expects inflation to rise gradually toward          2 percent as the labor market improves further and the transitory effects of lower energy prices and other factors dissipate.
 The Committee continues to monitor inflation developments closely.
"To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee today reaffirmed its view that the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate remains appropriate."
" In determining how long to maintain this target range, the Committee will assess progress —both realized and expected —toward its objectives of maximum employment and         2 percent inflation."
" This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments."
" Based on its current assessment, the Committee judges that it can be patient in beginning to normalize the stance of monetary policy."
" The Committee sees this guidance as consistent with its previous statement that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time following the end of its asset purchase program in October, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee’s 2 percent longer -run goal, and provided that longerterm inflation expectations remain well anchored."
" However, if incoming information indicates faster progress toward the Committee’s employment and inflation objectives than the Committee now expects, then increases in the target range for the federal funds rate are likely to occur sooner than currently anticipated."
"When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longerrun goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent."
" The Committee currently anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near mandateconsistent levels, economic conditions may, Page 10Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run.”  Voting for this action:   Janet L."
Mr. Fisher agreed that the Committee should be patient in beginning to normalize the stance of monetary policy.
 Mr. Kocherlakota dissented because he believed that the Committee’s decision and statement did not respond to ongoing belowtarget inflation and falling marketbased measures of longerterm inflation expectations.
" In his judgment, the credibility of the Committee’s 2 percent inflation target was at risk, calling for a  more accommodative policy stance."
"English Secretary Minutes of the Meeting of December 16–17, 2014Page 11_____________________________________________________________________________________________Summary of Economic Projections In conjunction with the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting held on December 16–17, 2014 , meeting participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real output growth, the unemployment rate, inflation, and the federal funds rate for each year from 2014 to 2017 and over the longer run.1  Each participant’s projection was b ased on information available at the time of the meeting plus his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy and assumptions about the factors likely to affect economic outcomes."
" The longerrun projections represent each participant’s assessment of the value to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy."
 “Appropriate monetary policy” is defined as the future path of policy that each participant deems most likely to foster outcomes for economic activity and inflation that best satisfy his or her individual interpretation of the Federal Reserve’s objectives of maximum employment and stable prices.
" Overall, FOMC participants expected that, after a slowdown in the first half of 2014, economic growth under appropriate policy would be faster in the second half of 2014 and over 2015 and 2016 than their estimates of the U.S. economy’s longer -run normal growth rate."
" On balance, participants then saw economic growth moving back toward their assessments of its longerrun pace in 2017 (table 1 and figure 1)."
" Most participants projected that the unemployment rate will continue to decline in 2015 and 2016, and all participants projected that the unemployment rate will be at or below their individual judgments of its longerrun normal level by the end of 2016."
" All participants projected that inflation, as measured by the fourquarter change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), would rise gradually, on balance, over the next few years."
 Most participants saw inflation approaching the Committee’s        2 percent longerrun objective in 2016 and 2017.
" While a few participants projected that inflation would rise temporarily above 2 percent during the forecast period, many others expected inflation to remain low through 2017."
 Participants judged that it would be appropriate to begin raising the target range for the federal funds rate over the projection period as labor market indicators and inflation move back toward values the Committee judges consistent with the attainment of its mandated objectives of maximum employment and stable prices.

" PCE inflation and  core PCE inflation are the percentage rates of change in, respectively, the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) and the price index for PCE excluding food and energy."
 Projections for the unemployment rate are for the average civilian unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of the year indicated.
 Each participant’ s projections are based on his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy.
  Longer -run projections represent each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each vari able would be expected to converge under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy.
 Longer -run projections for core PCE inflation are not collected.

Most participants viewed the uncertainty associated with their outlooks for economic growth and the unemployment rate as broadly similar to the average level of the past 20 years.
" Most participants also judged the level of uncertainty about inflation to be broadly similar to the average level of the past 20 years, although a few participants viewed it as higher."
" In addition, most participants continued to see the risks to the outlook for economic growth and for the unemployment rate as broadly balanced."
" A majority saw the risks to inflation as broadly balanced; however, a number of participants saw the risks to inflation as weighted to the downside, while one judged these risks as tilted to the upside."
"The Outlook for Economic Activity Participants projected that, conditional on their individual assumptions about appropriate monetary policy, growth in real gross domestic product (GDP) would pick up from its low level in the first half of 2014 and run above their estimates of its longerrun normal rate in the second half of 2014 and over 2015 and 2016."
" Participants pointed to a number of factors that they expected would contribute to stronger real output growth , including improving labor market conditions, lower energy prices, rising household net worth , diminishing restraint from fiscal policy, and highly accommodative monetary policy."
" On balance, participants saw real GDP growth moving back toward, but remaining at or somewhat above, its longerrun rate in 2017 as monetary policy adjusts appropriately."
"In general, participants’ revision s to their forecasts for real GDP growth relative to their projections for the September meeting were modest."
" However, all participants revised up their projections of real GDP growth somewhat for 2014, with a number of them noting that recent data releases regarding real economic activity had been stronger than anticipated."
" The central tendencies of participants’ current projections for real GDP growth were 2.3 to 2.4 percent in 2014, 2.6 to 3.0 percent in 2015, 2.5 to 3.0 percent in 2016, and 2.3 to 2.5 percent in 2017."
" The central tendency of the projections of real GDP growth over the longer run was 2.0 to 2.3 percent , unchanged from September."
"All participants projected that the unemployment rate will decline, on balance, through 2016, and all participants projected that, by the end of that year, the unemployment rate will be at or below their individual judgments of its longerrun normal level."
" The central tendencies of participants’ forecasts for the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of each year were 5.8 percent in 2014, 5.2 to 5.3 percent in 2015, 5.0 to 5.2 percent in 2016, and 4.9 to 5.3 percent in 2017."
 Almost all participants’ projected paths for the unemployment rate shifted down slightly through 2015 compared with their projections in September ; many participants not ed that recent data pointing to improving labor market conditions were an important factor underlying the downward revisions in their unemployment rate forecasts.
" The central tendency of participants’ estimates of the longer -run normal rate of unemployment that would prevail under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy was unchanged at 5.2 to    5.5 percent; the range of these estimates was 5.0 to        5.8 percent, down slightly from 5.0 to 6.0 percent in September."
Figures 3.A and 3.B show that participants held a range of views regarding the likely outcomes for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate through 2017.
" Some of the diversity of views reflected their individual assessments of the effects of lower oil prices on consumer spending and business investment, of the rate at which the forces that have been restraining the pace of the economic recovery would continue to abate , of the trajectory for growth in consumption as labor market slack diminishes, and of the appropriate path of monetary policy."
" Relative to September, the dispersion of participants’ projections for real GDP growth was little changed from 2015 to 2017, while for the unemployment rate, the dispersion was a bit narrower ."
" The Outlook for Inflation  Compared with September, the central tendencies of participants’ projections for PCE inflation under the assumption of appropriate monetary policy moved down for 2014 and 2015 but were largely unchanged for 2016 and 2017."
" In commenting on the changes to their projections, many participants indicated that the significant decline in energy prices and the appreciation of the dollar since the Committee’s September meeting likely will put temporary downward pressure on inflation."
 The central tendencies of participants ’ projections for core PCE inflation moved down somewhat for 2015 but were mostly unchanged in other years.
" Almost all participants projected that PCE inflation would rise gradually, on balance, over the period from 2015 to 2017, reaching a level at or near the Committee’s 2 percent objective."
" A  few participants expected PCE inflation to rise slightly Summary of Economic Projections of the Meeting of December 16–17, 2014Page 3_____________________________________________________________________________________________Figure 2."

" The central tendencies for PCE inflation were 1.2 to 1.3 percent in 2014, 1.0 to 1.6 percent in 2015, 1.7 to 2.0 percent in 2016, and 1.8 to 2.0 percent in 2017."
" The central tendencies of the forecasts for core inflation were higher than those for the headline measure in 2014 and 2015, reflecting the effects of lower oil prices."
" Factors cited by participants as likely to contribute to a gradual rise of inflation toward the Committee’s longer -run objective of 2 percent included stable longerterm inflation expectations, steadily diminishing resource slack, a pickup in wage growth, waning effects of declines in oil prices, and stillaccommodative monetary policy."
  Figures 3.C and 3.D provide information on the diversity of participants’ views about the outlook for inflation.
" In addition to moving lower, t he range of participants’ projections for PCE inflation in 2015 widened somewhat relative to September, likely reflecting in part differences in participants’ assessments of the effects of the recent decline in energy prices on the outlook for inflation."
 The ranges for core inflation narrowed in 2014 and 2015.
" In other years of the projection, the ranges of the inflation projections were relatively little changed."
Appropriate Monetary Policy Participants judged that it would be appropriate to begin raising the target range for the federal funds rate over the projection period as labor market indicators and inflation move back toward values the Committee judges consistent with the attainment of its mandated objectives of maximum employment and price stability.
"All participants projected that the unemployment rate would be at or below 5.5 percent at the end of the year in which they judged the initial increase in the target range for the federal funds rate would be warranted, and all but one anticipated that inflation would be at or below the Committee’s 2 percent goal at th e end of that year."
 Most participants projected that the unemployment rate would be at or somewhat above their estimates of its longerrun normal level at that time.
 Participants provided a number of reasons why they thought it would be appropriate for the federal funds rate to remain below its longerrun normal level for some time after inflation and the unemployment rate were near mandateconsistent levels.
" These reasons included an assessment that the headwinds that have been holding back the recovery will continue to exert some restraint on economic activity at that time, that residual slack in the labor market will still be evident in other measures of labor utilization, and that the risks to the economic outlook are asymmetric as a result of the constraints on monetary policy associated with the effective lower bound on the federal funds rate."
" All participants judged that inflation over the longer run would be equal to the Committee ’s inflation objective of 2 percent, implying that their individual judgments regarding the appropriate longerrun level of the real federal funds rate in the absence of further shocks to the economy ranged from 1.25 to 2.25 percent."

 Some participants also mentioned the prescriptions of various monetary policy rules as factors they considered in judging the appropriate path for the federal funds rate.
Uncertainty and Risks Nearly all participants continued to judge the levels of uncertainty attending their projections for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate as broadly similar to the norms during the previous 20 years (figure 4).  Most participants continued to see the risks to their outlooks for real GDP growth as broadly balanced.
 A few participants viewed the risks to real GDP growth as weighted to the downside; one viewed the risks as weighted to the upside.
" Those participants who viewed the risks as weighted to the downside cited, for example, concern about the limited ability of monetary policy at the effective lower bound to respond to further negative shocks to the economy or about the trajectory for economic growth abroad."
" As in September, nearly all participants judged the risks to the outlook for the unemployment rate to be broadly balanced."
"As in September, participants generally agreed that the levels of uncertainty associated with their inflation forecasts were broadly similar to historical norms, and most  Table 2 provides estimates of the forecast uncertainty for the change in real GDP, the unemployment rate, and total consumer price inflation over the period from 1994 through 2013."
" A number of participants, however, viewed the risks to their inflation forecasts as tilted to the downside ; the reasons discussed included the possibility that the recent low levels of inflation could prove more persistent than anticipated; the possibility that the upward pull on prices from inflation expectations might be weaker than assumed; or the judgment that, in current circumstances, it would be difficult for the Committee to respond effectively to lowinflation outcomes."
" Conversely, one participant saw upside risks to inflation, citing uncertainty about the timing and efficacy of the Committee’s withdrawal of monetary policy accommodation."

" As described in the box “Forecast Uncertainty,” under certain assumptions, there is about a 70 percent probability that actual outcomes for real GDP, unemployment, and consumer prices will be in ranges impli ed by the average size of projection errors made in the past."

"Table 2 summarizes the average historical accuracy of a range of forecasts, including those reported in past Monetary Policy Report s and those prepared by the Federal Reserve Board ’s staff in advance of meetings of the Federal Open Market Co mmittee."
" The corresponding 70 percent confidence intervals fo r overall inflation would be 1.8 to 2.2  percent in the current year, 1.1 to 2.9 percent in the second year, and 1.0 to 3.0 percent in the third and fourth  years."
" As with real activity and inflation, the outlook for the future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable uncertainty."
 This uncertainty arises primarily because each participant’s assessment of the appropriate stance of monetary policy depends importantly on the evolution of real activity and inflation over time.
