"Page 2Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ Review of Monetary Policy Strategy, Tools, and Communication Practices   Committee participants continued their discussions related to the ongoing review of the Federal Reserve's monetary policy strategy, tools, and communication practices."
" Sta ff briefings provided an assessment of a range of monetary policy tools that the Committee could employ to provide additional economic stimulus and bolster inflation outcomes, particularly in future episodes in which the policy rate would be constrained by  the effective lower bound (ELB)."
" Nonetheless, the staff  suggested that forward guidance generally had been effective in easing financial conditions and stimulating economic activity in circumstances when the policy rate was above the ELB and when it was at the ELB."
" The briefing also discussed negative interest rates, a policy option implemented by sev eral foreign central banks."
"  However, going forward, such policies might not be as effective because longer -term interest rates would likely be much lower at the onset of a future asset purchase program than they were before the financial crisis."
 The staff also compared the benefits and costs associated with asset purchase programs that are of a fixed cumulative size and those that are flow -based —where purchases continue   at a specific pace until certain macroeconomic outcomes are achieved —and examined the potential effectiveness of  using asset purchases to place ceilings on interest rates.
" On the one hand, relative to qualitative  or datebased forward guidance, outcome -based forward guidance has the advantage of creating an explicit link between future monetary policy actions and macroeconomic conditions, thereby helping to support economic stabilization efforts and foster transparency and accountability."
" A few participants commented that outcome -based forward guidance, tied to inflation outcomes, could be a useful tool to reinforce the Committee’s commitment to its symmetric 2  percent  objective."
" In addition, some participants noted that the effectiveness of these tools might be diminished in the future , as longer -term interest rates have declined to very low levels and would likely be even lower followin g an adverse shock that could lead to the resumption of large -scale asset purchases; as a result, there might be limited scope for balance sheet tools to  provide accommodation."
 A few participants saw benefits to capping longer -term interest rates that more directly influence household and business spending .
" In addition, capping longer -maturity interest rate s using balance sheet tools , if judged  as credible by market participants , might require a smaller amount of asset purchases to provide a similar amount of accommodation as  a quantitybased program purchasing longer -maturity securities."
 Some of those participants noted that uncertainty regarding the neutral federal funds rate and regarding the effect s of rate ceiling policies on future interest rates and inflation  made it difficult to determine the appropriate level of the rate ceiling or when that ceiling should be removed; that maintaining a rate ceiling could result in an elevated level of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet or significant volatility in its size or maturity composition; or that managing longer -term interest rates might be seen as interacting with the federal debt management process.
" By contrast, a majority of participants saw greater benefits in using balance sheet tools to cap shorter -term interest rates and reinforce forward guidance about the near -term path of the policy rate."
 All participants judged that negative interest rates currently did not appear to be an attractive monetary policy tool in the U nited States.
 Participants noted that negative interest rates would entail risks of introducing significant complexity or  distortions to the financial system.
" In particular, some participants cautioned that the financial system in the United States is considerably different from those in countries that implemented negative interest rate policies, and that  negative rates could have more significant adverse effects on market functioning and  financial stability here than abroad."
" Notwithstanding these considerations, participants did not rule out the possibility that circumstances could arise in which it might be appropriate to reassess the potential role of negative interest rates as a policy tool."
" In addition, against a background of inflation undershooting the symmetric 2 percent objective for several years, some participants raised the concern that the scope to reduce the federal funds rate to provide support to economic activity in future recessions could be reduced further if inflation shortfalls continued and led to a decline in inflation expectations."
 Doing so would help ensure the anchoring of inflation expectations at a level consistent with the Committee’s symmetric 2  percent  inflation objective.
" Some  participants thought it would be helpful for the Committee to evaluate how its tools could be utilized in different economic scenarios, such as when longer -term interest rates were significantly below current levels, and discuss which actions would best address the challenges posed by each scenario."
" Several participants noted that, particularly if monetary policy became severely constrained at the ELB, expansionary fiscal policy would be especially important in addressing an economic downturn."
" Participan ts expected that, at upcoming meetings, they would continue their deliberations on the Committee’s review of the monetary policy framework as well as the Committee’s Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy."
"  Regarding the outlook for U.S. monetary policy, the Open Market Desk’s  surveys and market -based indicators pointed to a high likelihood of a 25  basis point cut in the target range at the October meeting."
Review of Options for Repo Operations to Support Control of the Federal Funds R ate The staff briefed participants on the recent experience with using repo operations to support control of the federal funds rate and on possibly maintaining a role  for repo operations in the monetary policy implementation framework over the longer run.
" Regular, modestly sized repo operations likely would pose relatively little risk of stigma  or moral hazard, but they may provide less assurance of control over the federal funds rate because it might be difficult for the Federal Reserve to anticipate money                                                            8 The staff briefed the Committee in June 2019 o n the possible role of a standing repo facility in the monetary policy implementation framework."
"  In their comments following the staff presentation, participants emphasized the importance of maintaining reserves  at a level consistent with the Commi ttee’s choice of an ample -reserves monetary policy implementation framework, in which control over the level of the federal funds rate is exercised primarily through the setting of the Federal Reserve’s administered rates and in which active management of the supply of reserves is not required."
" Several of these participants also suggested tha t, if a standing facility were created that allowed banks to monetize a portion of their securities holdings at times of market stress , banks could possibly reduce their demand for reserves  in normal times , which Page 6Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ could make it feasible for the monetary policy implementation framework to operate with a significantly smaller quantity of reserves  than would otherwise be needed ."
" Consumer price inflation, as measured by the 12 -month percentage change in the price ind ex for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), remained below 2  percent  in August."
 Survey -based measures of longer -run inflation expectations were little changed.
" Total nonfarm payroll employment expanded at a slower pace in September than in the previous two months, but the average pace for the third quarter was similar to that for the first half of the year."
" However, the pace of job gains so far this year was slower than last year, even after accounting for the anticipated effects of the Bureau of Labo r Statistics’ benchmark revision to payroll employment, which will be incorporated in the published data in February 2020."
" The unemployment rate moved down to a 50 -year low of 3.5  percent  in September, while the labor force participation rate held steady and the employment- topopulation ratio moved up."
" The unemployment rates for Asians, Hispanics, and whites each moved lower in September, but the rate for African Americans was unchanged; the unemployment rate for each group was below its level at the end of the previous economic expansion, though persistent differentials between these rates remained."
 The four -week moving average of initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits through mid -October remained near histori cally low levels.
" Core PCE price inflation (which excludes changes in consumer food and energy prices) was 1.8 percent  over that same 12 -month period, while consumer food price inflation was well below core inflation, and consumer energy prices decl ined."
 The trimmed mean measure of 12 -month PCE price inflation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas remained at 2 percent  in August.
" Recent readings on survey -based measures of longer -run inflation expectations —including those from the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers, the Blue Chip Economic Indicators, and the Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers and Surve y of Market Participants —were little changed, on balance, al though  the Michigan survey measure ticked down to the low end of its recent range."
" Key factors that influence consumer spending —including the low unemployment rate, further gains in real disposable inco me, high levels of households’ net worth, and generally low borrowing rates—were supportive of solid real PCE growth in the near term."
" Orders for nondefense capital goods excluding  aircraft decreased over those two months and were still below the level of shipments , most measures of business sentiment deteriorated , analysts’ expectations of firms’ longer -term profit growth declined somewhat further , and concerns about trade developm ents continued to weigh on firms’ investment decisions."
" Overall manufacturing production appeared likely to remain soft in coming months, reflecting generally weak readin gs on new orders from national and regional manufacturing surveys, declining domestic business investment, weak GDP growth abroad, and a persistent drag from trade developments."
" The nominal U.S. international trade deficit w idened in August, reflecting a subdued pace of export growth and a moderate pace of import growth."
 Export growth was subdued due to lackluster exports of services and capital goods.
" Advance estimates for September suggested that goods imports fell more than exports, pointing to a narrowing of the monthly trade deficit."
 The Bureau of Economic Analysis estimated that net exports made a slight negative contribution to real GDP growth in the third quarter.
 Incoming data suggested that growth in the foreign economies remained subpar in the third quarter.
" Similarly, GDP growth remained subdued in China and several other emerging economies in Asia, and indicators suggested that growth in Latin America also remained weak."
" Foreign inflation appeared to have moderated a bit in the  third quarter, reflecting declines in energy prices."
 Inflation remained relatively low in most foreign economies.
 Financing conditions for businesses and households remained generally supportive of spending and economic activity.
  Measures of inflation compensation over the next 5 years and 5 to 10 years ahead based on Treasury Inflation -Protected Securities inched down and remained near multiyear low levels.
" After smoothing  through rate volatility over the period, interest rates for overnight unsecured and s ecured funding declined roughly in line with the reduction in the target range for the federal funds rate at the September FOMC meeting and the associated 30 basis point decrease in the  interest on excess reserves ( IOER ) rate."
" Meanwhile, growth of commercial and industrial (C&I) loans at banks was modest in the third quarter as a whole."
" Respondents to the October 2019 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS) reported that borrower demand weakened for C&I loans over the third quarter,  while lending standards on such loans were about unchanged."
" T he volume of agency and non -agency commercial mortgage-backed securities  issuance was strong in September, in part supported by recent declines in interest rates."
 Growth of CRE loan s on banks’ books was little changed in the third quarter.
 Banks in the October SLOOS reported tighter lending standards for all types of CRE loans; they also reported weaker demand for construction lending and stronger demand for the other  CRE lending cat egories.
" Interest rates on auto loans fell, on net, since the beginning of the year, and interest rates on credit card accounts leveled off through August."
" Nonetheless, the  staff noted that the resilience of financial institutions could be  undermined by low interest rates and banks’ announced plans to increase payouts to shareholders."
 Staff Economic Outlook  The projection for U.S. real GDP growth prepared by the staff for the October FOMC meeting was revised down a little for the second half of this year relative to the previous projection.
" The medium -term projection for real GDP growth was essentially unchanged, as revisions to the staff’s assumptions about factors on which the forecast was conditioned, such as financial market variables, were small and offsetting."
 Output was forecast to expand at a rate a little above the staff’s estimate of its potential rate of growth in 2019 and 2020 and then t o slow to a pace slightly below potential output growth in 2021 and 2022.
 The unemployment rate was projected to be roughly flat through 2022 and to remain below the staff’s estimate of its longer -run natural rate.
  The staff’s forecast for core PCE pric e inflation this year was revised down a little in response to recent data.
" Beyond this year, the projection for core inflation was unrevised, and the forecast for total inflation was a little lower in 2020 because of  a downward revision in projected consumer energy prices."
" Both total  inflation  and core inflation were forecast to move up slightly next year, as the low inflation readings early this year were viewed as transitory; nevertheless, both inflation measures were forecast to continue to run somewh at below 2  percent  through 2022."
" The staff continued to view the uncertainty around its projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as generally similar to the average of the past 20 years."
" Moreover, the staff still judged that the risks to the forecast for real GDP growth were tilted to the downside, with a corresponding skew to the upside for the unemployment rate."
" In addition, softness in business investment and manufacturing so far this year was seen as pointing to the possibility of a more substantial slowing in economic growth than the staff projected."
" The risks to the inflation projection were also viewed as Page 10Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ having a downward skew, in part because of the downside risks to the forecast for economic activity."
 Participa nts’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook  Participants agreed that the labor market had remained strong over the intermeeting period and that economic activity had risen at a moderate rate.
" Job gains had been solid, on average, in recent m onths, and the unemployment rate had remained low."
" On a 12month basis, overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy  were running below 2  percent."
 Market -based measures of inflation compensation remained low; survey -based measures of longer -term inflation expectations were little changed.
" Participants jud ged that sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee’s symmetric 2  percent  objective were the most likely outcomes, and they indicated that their views on these outcomes had changed little since the September meeting."
" In addition, inflation pressures remained muted."
 The risk that a global growth slowdown would further weigh on the domestic economy remained prominent.
" In addition, survey measures of consumer confidence remained high, and a couple of participants commented that business contacts in consumer -facing industries report ed strong demand."
" Many participants noted that components of household spending that are thought to be particularly sensitive to interest rates had improved, including purchases of consumer durables."
"  In their discussions of the business sector, participants saw trade tensions and concerns about the global growth outlook as the main factors contributing to weak business investment a nd exports and the associated restraint on domestic  economic growth."
" Moreover, participants generally expected that trade uncertainty and sluggish global growth would continue to damp investment spending and exports."
" Manufacturing production remained weak, and continuing concerns about global growth and trade uncertainty suggested that conditions were unlikely to improve materially over the near term."
" In addition, a few  participants noted ongoing  challenges in the agricultural sector, including those associated with lower crop yields, tariffs, weak export demand, and difficult financial positions for many farmers."
" Participants judged that conditions in the labor market remained strong, with the unemployment rate near historical lows and continued solid job gains, on average."
" However, the pace of increases in employment had slowed some, on net, in recent months."
" On the other hand, slowing job gains might also be indicative of some cooling in labor demand, which may be consistent with an observed decline in the rate of job openings and decreases in other measures of labor market tightness."
 Several participants commented that the preliminary benchmark revision released in August by the Bureau of Labor Statistics had indicated that payroll employment gains would likely show less momentum coming into this year once those revisions are incorporated in publis hed data early next year.
 Growth of wages had also slowed this year by some measures.
" Consistent with strong national data on _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of October 29–30, 2019Page 11 the labor market, business contacts in many Districts indicated continued strong labor demand, with firms still reporting diffic ulties finding qualified workers, or broadening their recruiting to include traditionally marginalized groups."
" In their discussion of inflation developments, participants noted that readings on overall and core PCE inflation, measured on a 12month change basis, had continued to run below the Committee's symmetric 2  percent  objective."
" While survey -based measures of longer -term inflation expectations were generally little changed, some measures of households’ inflation expectations had moved down to histori cally low levels."
" Market -based measures of inflation compensation remained low, with some longer -term measures being at or near multi -year lows."
" Weakness in the global economy, perceptions of downside risks to growth, and subdued global inflation pressur es were cited as factors tilting inflation risk to the downside, and a few participants commented that they expected inflation to run below 2  percent  for some time."
" Some other participants, however, saw the recent inflation data as consistent with their previous assessment that much of the weakness seen early in the year would be transitory, or that some recent monthly readings seemed broadly consistent with the Committee's longer -run inflation objective of 2  percent."
 A couple of participants noted that some measures of inflation could temporarily move above 2  percent  early next year because of  the transitory effects of tariffs.
" Participants also discussed risks regarding the outlook for economic activity, which remained tilted to the downside."
" In particular, some further  signs of a global slowdown in economic growth emerged; weakening in the global economy could further restrain the domestic economy, and the risk that the weakness in domestic business spending, manufacturing, and exports could give rise to slower hiring and weigh on household spending remained prominent."
"  In their consideration of the monetary policy options at this meeting, most participants believed that a reduction of 25 basis points in the target range for the federal funds rate would be appropriate."
" In discussing the reasons for such a decision, these participants continued to point to global developments weighing on the economic outlook, the need to provide insurance against potential downside risks to the economic outlook, and the importance of returning inflation to the Committee’s symmetric 2  percent objective on a sustained basis."
  Many participants judged that an additional modest easing at this meeting was appropriate in light  of persistent weakness in global growth and elevated uncertainty regarding trade developments.
"  Nonetheless, these participants noted that incoming data had continued to suggest that the economy had proven resilient in the face of continued headwinds from global developments  and that previous adjustments to monetary policy would continue to help sustain economic growth."
" In addition, several participants suggested that a modest easing of policy at this meeting would likely better align the target range for the federal funds rate with  a variety of indicators used to assess the appropriate policy stance, including estimates of the neutral interest rate and the slope of the yield curve."
" In particular, risks to the outlook associated with global economic growth and international trade were still seen as significant despite some encouraging geopolitical and traderelated developments over the intermeeting period."
  Many participants also cited the level of inflation or inflation expectations as justifying a reduction of 25  basis points in the federal funds rate at this meeting.
" Inflation continued to run below the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent  objective , and infla tionary pressures remained muted."
 Several participants raised concerns that measures of inflation expectations remained low and could decline further  without a more accommodative policy stance.
" A couple of these participants, pointing to experiences in Japan and the euro area, were concerned that persistent inflation shortfalls could lead to a decline in longer -run inflation expectations  and less room to reduce the federal funds rate in the event of a future recession."
" In general, the participants  who ju stified further easing at this meeting based on considerations related to inflation  viewed this action as helping to move inflation up to the Committee’s 2  percent  objective on a sustained basis and to anchor inflation expectations at levels consistent with that objective."
" These participants suggested that the baseline projection for the economy remained favorable , with inflation expected to move up and stay near the Committee’s 2  percent objective."
" They also judged that policy accommodation was already adequate and, in light of lags in the transmission of monetary policy, preferred to take some time to assess the economic effects of the Committee’s previous policy actions before easing policy further."
 A few participants raised the concern that a further easing of monetary policy at this meeting could encourage excessive risk -taking and exacerbate imbalances in the financial sector.
" With regard to monetary  policy beyond this meeting, most participants judged that the stance of policy, after a 25 basis point reduction at this meeting, would be well calibrated to support the outlook of moderate growth, a strong labor market, and inflation near the Committee’s  symmetric 2  percent  objective and likely would remain so as long as incoming information about the economy  did not result in a material reassessment of the economic outlook."
 A couple of participants  expressed t he view that the Committee should  reinforce its postmeeting statement with additional communications indicating that another reduction in the federal funds rate was unlikely in the near term unless incoming information was consistent with a significant slowdown in the pace of economic activity.
"  Committee Policy Action  In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, members noted that information received since the September meeting indicated that the labor market remained strong and that economic  activity had been rising at a moderate rate."
" Job gains had been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate had remained low."
" However, business fixed investment and exports remained weak, as softness in global growth and international trade developments continued to weigh on those sectors."
" On a 12 -month basis, both the overall inflation rate and inflation for items other than food and energy were running below 2  percent ."
 Market -based measures of inflation compensation remained low.
 Survey-based measures of longer -term inflation expectations were little changed.
"  In light of the implications of global developments for the economic outlook as well as muted inflation pressures, most  members agreed to lower the target range for the federal funds rate to 1½ to 1¾  percent  at this meeting."
" The members who supported this action _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of October 29–30, 2019Page 13 viewed it as consistent with helping offset the effects on aggregate demand of weak global growth and trade developments, insuring against downside risks arising from those sources, and promoting a more rapid return of inflation to the Committee’s symmetric 2  percent  objective."
" These members indicated that the economic outlook remained positive and that they anticipated, under an unchanged policy stance, continued strong labor market conditions and solid growth in activity, with inflation gradually moving up t o the Committee’s 2  percent  objective."
"  Members agreed that, in determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee would assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum -employment objective and its symmetric 2  percent  inflation objective."
" They also agreed that those assessments would take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
" In describing the monetary policy outlook, they also agreed to remove the “ act as appropriate” language and emphasize that the Committee would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook  as it assessed the appropriate path of the target range for the federal funds rate."
 This change was seen as consistent with the view that the current stance of monetary policy was likely to remain appropriate as long as the economy performed broadly in line with the Committee’s expectations and that policy was not on a preset course and could change if developments emerged that led to a material reassessment of the economic outlook.
” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00  p.m.: Page 14Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ “Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in September indicates that the labor market remains strong and that economic activity has been rising at a moderate rate.
" Job gains have been sol id, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low."
" On a 12month basis, overall inflation and inflation for items  other than food  and energy are running below 2  percent ."
 Market -based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey -based measures of longer -term inflation expectations are little changed.
" Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks  to foster maximum employment and price stability."
" In light of the implications of global developments for the economic outlook as well as muted inflation pressures, the Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate to 1½  to 1¾ percent ."
" This action supports the Committee’ s view that sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee’s symmetric 2  percent  objective are the most likely outcomes, but uncertainties about this outlook remain."
" In determining the timing and size of future adjustme nts to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric  2 percent  inflation objective."
" This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
 President  George  dissented at this meeting because she believed that an unchanged setting of monetary policy was appropriate based on incoming data and the outlook for economic activity over the medium term.
 President Rosengren dissented because he judged that monetary policy was already accommodat ive and that additional accommodation was not needed for an economy in which labor markets are very tight.
" Consistent with the Committee’s decision to lower the target range for the federal funds rate to 1½  to 1¾ percent, the Board of Governors voted unanimously to lower the interest rate paid on required and excess reserve balances to 1.55 percent  and voted unanimously to approve a ¼ percent age point decrease in the primary credit rate to 2."
" Videoconference meeting of October  4, 2019  The Committee met by videoconference on October 4, 2019, to review developments in money markets and to discuss steps the Committee could take to facilitate efficient and effective implementation of monetary policy."
 The manager pro tem reviewed options that the Committee could consider to boost the level of reserves in the banking system and to address temporary money market pressures that could adversely affect monetary policy implementation.
" Overall, participants agreed that the pace of p urchases as well as the parameters of the repo operations were technical details of monetary policy implementation not intended to affect the stance of monetary policy and should be communicated as such."
" Almost all of these participants noted that such a facility was an option to provide a backstop to buffer shocks that could adversely affect policy implementation, and several of these participants mentio ned the potential for the facility to support banks’ liquidity risk management while reducing the demand for reserves."
"On October 11, 2019, the Committee approved by notation vote the following statement that outlines steps to ensure that the supply of reserves remains ample so that control over the level of the federal funds rate and other shortterm interest rates is  exercised primarily through the setting of the Federal Reserve ’s administered rates, and in which active management of the supply of reserves is not required."
" Page 16Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ STATEMENT REGARDING MONETARY POLICY IMPLEMENTATION  (Adopted October 11, 2019)  Consistent with i ts January 2019 Statement Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation and Balance Sheet Normalization, the Committee reaffirms its intention to implement monetary policy in a regime in which an ample supply of reserves ensures that control over the level of the federal funds rate and other short -term interest rates is exercised primarily through the setting of the Federal Reserve ’s administered rates, and in which active management of the supply of reserves is not required."
" These actions are purely technical measures to support the effective implementation of the FOMC ’s monetary policy, and do not represent a change in the stance of monetary policy."
 The Committee stands ready to adjust the details of these plans as necessary to foster efficient and effective implementation of monetary policy.
