" Policy -sensitive rates increased over the intermeeting period, reflecting indications of continued resilience in the economy, persistently elevated core inflation, and reduced down side tail risks following the resolution of the debt limit."
 The increase in nominal yields primarily reflected higher real rates rather than inflation compensation.
" Cyclical sectors fared better than sectors that tend  to appreciate in a downturn, suggesting some reduced investor concern about downside risks to growth."
" Desk survey respondents still saw a recession occurring in the near term as quite likely, but the expected timing was again pushed later , as economic data pointed to the continued resilience of economic activity."
" With regard to inflation expectations, respondents marked up their projections for quarterly core personal consumption expenditures (PCE ) inflation in the second and third quarters of this year, while projections for later quarters were little changed."
 This expectation likely reflected a combination of rising net supply of bills as part of the Treasury Department’s plan to rebuild the Treasury General Account (TGA) following the resolution of the debt limit and expectations for healthy investor demand for bills.
" Labor market conditions remained tight in recent months, as job gains were robust and the unemployment rate was low."
 Consumer price inflation —as measured by the 12 -month percent change in the price index for PCE —continued to be elevated in April.
 Total nonfarm payroll employment increased at a robust pace during those two months.
" The unemployment rate edged up, on net, but was still at a low level of 3.7 percent  in May."
" On balance, the unemployment rate Minutes of the Meeting of June 13–14, 2023Page 3_____________________________________________________________________________________________ for African Americans moved up to 5.6 percent, while the jobless rate for Hispanics moved down to 4.0  percent."
" In aggregate, the labor force participation rate held steady in April and May, and the employment -topopulation ratio ticked down."
"  Recent measures of nominal wage growth continued to be elevated , although lower than their highs last year."
 Consumer price inflation remained elevated.
" Total PCE price inflation had eased since the middle of last y ear, reflecting declines in consumer energy prices and softening consumer food price inflation, but recent readings for core PCE price inflation—which excludes changes in consumer energy prices and most consumer food prices and usually provides a better signal about future inflation than the more volatile total inflation measure —were little changed."
" Total PCE price inflation was 4.4 percent over the 12 months ending in April, and core PCE price inflation was 4.7 percent —the same as the 12month percent change recorded in January."
" In May, the 12 -month change in the consumer price index (CPI) was 4.0 percent, and core CPI inflation was 5.3 percent—only slightly below its January reading."
 The trimmed mean measure of 12 -month PCE price inflation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas was 4.8 percent in April.
 Surveybased measures of longer -term inflation expectations in May from the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Survey of Consumer Expectatio ns remained within the range of their values reported in the decade before the pandemic; near -term measures of inflation expectations from these surveys moved down in May and continued to be below their peaks seen last year.
" For the first half as a whole, PDFP growth seemed to be more resilient than in the second half of last year."
"   The annual revisions to international  trade statistics suggested that net exports contributed positively to U.S. real GDP growth in the first quarter, with real exports rebounding more strongly than real imports following their fourthquarter declines."
" In April, however, the nominal trade deficit widened notably, as nominal exports decreased and nominal imports rose further."
" Foreign economic growth rebounded in the first quarter, reflecting in part the reopening of China’s economy from its COVID19-related shutdowns and strong  services -sector activity in other Asian countries, Canada, and Mexico."
" Indicators pointed to a stepdown in the pace of foreign economic growth in the second quarter, with the impetus from China’s reopening dissipating and global manufacturing activity remaining weak."
 Declines in retail energy prices since the beginning of the year contributed to a notable easing in headline consumer price inflation in the foreign economies.
" By contrast, core inflation had yet to materially decline from its re cent highs in many economies."
" In this context, and with tight labor market conditions, foreign central banks underscored the need to raise policy rates further or hold them at sufficiently restrictive levels to bring inflation back to their respective targets and be well positioned in case inflation failed to decline as expected."
" Staff Review of the Financial Situation  Over the intermeeting period, market participants appeared to interpret incoming data as signaling, on balance, more resilience in economic activity than previously assumed and viewed communications from FOMC participants overall as pointing to a tighter path for policy than expected."
" The rise in nominal yields mostly reflected an increase in real yields, as measures of inflation compensation were little changed, on net, amid somewhat mixed news on inflation."
 Measures of uncertainty about the path of interest rates remained very elevated by his torical standards.
"  Marketbased policy rate expectations rose notably in most advanced foreign economies, as core inflation data surprised to the upside in some countries and central bank communications were perceived as pointing to more restrictive policy than expected."
" The staff’s tradeweighted broad dollar index was also little changed, on net, but the exchange value of the dollar appreciated significantly against the Chinese renminbi amid increased investor concerns over China’s economic growth prospects."
" Interest rates on newly originated bank loans to businesses and households in the first quarter rose further above their peaks from the previous tightening cycle, and yields on leveraged loans also rose, reaching levels close to their peak at the onset of the pandemic."
" Interest rates on credit card offers continued to rise through April , and auto loan interest rates moved sideways during the intermeeting period."
" Both credit card and auto loan interest rates stood at, or near, their highest levels since the Global Financial Crisis."
" Banks also continued to attract inflows of large time deposits, reflecting higher interest rates on new certificates of deposit."
" Leveraged loan issuance remained subdued, reflecting weak investor demand amid concerns over the credit worthiness of borrowers."
 Real GDP growth over 2024 and 2025 was projected to be below the staff’s estimate of potential output growth.
" The unemployment rate was forecast to increase this year, peak next year, and remain near that level  through 2025."
" Current tight resource utilization in both product and labor markets was forecast to ease, with the level of real output moving below the staff’s estimate of potential output in 2025 and the unemployment rate rising above the staff’s estimate of its natural rate at that time."
" The staff’s inflation forecast was little revised relative to the previous projection, and supply– demand imbalances in both goods markets and labor markets were sti ll judged to be easing only slowly."
" On a four -quarter change basis, total PCE price inflation was projected to be 3.0 percent this year, with core inflation at 3.7 percent."
 Core goods inflation was forecast to move down further this year and then remain subdued .
 Housing services inflation was considered to have about peaked and was expected to move down over the rest of the year .
 Core nonhousing services inflation was projected to slow gradually as nominal wage growth eased further.
" Reflecting the effects of the easing in resource utilization over the projection, core inflation was forecast to slow through next year but remain moderately above 2 percent."
" With expected declines in consumer energy prices and further moderation in food price inflation, total inflation was projected to run below core inflation this year and the next."
" In 2025, both total and core PCE price inflation were expected to be close to 2 percent."
" On balance, the staff saw the risks  around the baseline inflation forecast as tilted to the upside, as economic scenarios with higher inflation appeared more likely than scenarios with lower inflation and because inflation could continue to be more persistent than expected and inflation expectations could become unanchored after a long period of elevated inflation."
" Participants ’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook  In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2023 through 2025 and over the longer run."
" The projections were based on their individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy, including the path of the federal funds rate."
" The longer -run projections represented each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy."
" In their discussion of current economic conditions, participants noted that economic activity had continued to expand at a modest pace."
" Nonetheless, job gains had been robust in recent months, and the unemployment rate had remained low."
 Inflation remained elevated.
" They commented that tighter credit conditions for households and businesses were li kely to weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation."
" Against this background, participants concurred that they remained highly attentive to inflation risks."
" Page 6Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ In assessing the economic outlook, most participants noted that real GDP growth  had been resilient in recent quarters ."
 Participants  generally judged that growth would be subdued over the remainder of this year.
" They assessed that the cumulative tightening of monetary policy over the past year had contributed significantly to more restrictive financial conditions and lower demand in the most interest rate sensitive sectors of the economy, especially housing and business investment."
 Participants also acknowledged uncertainty about the lags with which monetary policy affects the economy and discussed the extent to which the full effects of monetary tightening on the economy had been realized.
"  While total inflation had moderated over the past year, core inflation had not shown a sustained easing since the beginning of the year."
" With inflation well above the Committee’s longer -run 2 percent objective, participants expected that a period of below -trend growth in real GDP and some softening in labor market conditions would be needed to bring aggregate supply and aggregate demand into better balance and reduce inflationary pressures sufficiently to return inflation to 2  percent over time."
" Participants generally continued to judge that a tightening in credit conditions spurred by banking -sector stress earlier in the year would likely weigh further on economic activity, but the extent remained uncertain."
 Several participants mentioned that credit conditions had not appeared to have tightened significantly beyond what would be expected in response to the monetary policy actions taken since early last year.
 Some participants judged that it was still too early to assess with confidence the eventual  effects of tighter bank credit conditions on economic activity and noted that it would be important to monitor closely the potential effects of  banking -sector developments on credit conditions and economic activity.
" A few participants mentioned that while , overall, the household sector still retained much of the excess savings it had accumulated during the pandemic , there were signs that  consumers were facing increasingly tighter budget constraints, given high inflation and, especially for low -income households, depleted savings."
" Some p articipants remarked that the effect of high interest rates on the housing sector appeared to be bottoming out, with home sales, builder sentiment, and new construction all having improved a little since the start of the year."
" In discussing that possibility, a couple of these participants also cited the recent subdued growth in aggregate hours worked."
" Participants  noted that labor market conditions remained very tight, with robust payroll gains and the unemployment rate still near historically low levels."
" Nevertheless, they noted some signs that supply and demand in the labor market were coming into better balance , with the primeage labor force participation rate moving up in recent months and further reductions in rates of job openings and quits, and  declines in average weekly hours ."
" Some participants pointed out that payroll gains had remained robust but noted that some other measures of employment —such as those based on the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ household survey, the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, or the Board staff’s measure of private employment using data from the payroll processing firm ADP —suggested that job growth may have been weaker than indicated by payroll employment."
"  Participants anticipated that employment growth would likely slow further, consistent with their projections of below -trend economic growth."
" Participants noted that nominal wage growth had shown signs of easing but observed that it was still running at a pace that, given current estimates of trend productivity growth, was above what would be consistent over the Minutes of the Meeting of June 13–14, 2023Page 7_____________________________________________________________________________________________ longer run with the Committee’s 2 percent inflation objective."
" Participants expected supply and demand conditions in the labor market to come into better balance over time, easing pressures on wages and prices."
"  Participants agreed that inflation was unacceptably high and noted that the data, including the CPI  for May, indicated that declines in inflation had been slower than they had expected."
" Participants observed that although core goods inflation had moderated since the middle of last year, it had slowed  less rapidly than expected in recent months, despite data and reports from business contacts indicating that supply chain constraints had continued to ease."
 S ome participants noted the recent moderation in housing services inflation and expected this trend  to continue.
" However, a few participants pointed to upside risks to the outlook for housing services inflation associated with near -record low inventories of homes  for sale, solid  housing demand, and lessthan -expected deceleration recently in measures of rents for leases signed by new tenants."
" Additionally, some participants remarked that core nonhousing services inflation had shown few signs of slowing in the past few months."
 Several participants noted that longer -term measures of inflation expectations from surveys of households and businesses remained well anchored.
" Participants emphasized that, with appropriate firming of monetary policy, wellanchored longer -term inflation expectations would support a return of inflation to the Committee’s 2 percent longer -run goal over time."
" Participants noted that the full effects of monetary tightening had likely yet to be observed , though several highlighted the possibility  that much of the effect of past monetary policy tightening may have already been realized ."
" Regarding  downside risks to economic activity, participants noted  the possibility that the cumulative and rapid tightening of monetary policy would eventually affect economic activity more than expected, and that the additional effects of the tightening of bank credit conditions could prove more substantial than anticipated."
" Regarding risks to inflation, with infla tion remaining well above the Committee’s longer -run goal, some participants mentioned  the possibility that longer -term inflation expectations could become unanchored, particularly in light of stronger -thanexpected consumer demand and a stilltight labor market."
 S everal participants cited the possibility of delayed effects of tighter credit conditions potentially contributing to a slowdown in economic activity  that reduce s inflationary pressures.
" In their consideration of appropriate monetary policy actions at this meeting, participants concurred that while inflation had moderated since the middle of 2022, it remained well above the Committee’s longer -run goal of 2 percent."
 Economic activity had continued to expand at a modest pace.
" The labor market remained very tight, with robust job gains in recent months and the unemployment rate still low, but there were some signs that supply and demand in the labor market were coming into better balance."
" The economy was facing headwinds from tighter credit conditions , including higher interest rates,  for households and businesses, which would likely weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation, although the extent of these effect remained uncertain ."
" Against this backdrop, and in consideration of the significant cumulative tightening in the stance of monetary policy and the lags with which policy affects economic activity and inflation, almost all participants judged it appropriate or acceptable to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5 to 5 ¼ percent at this meeting."
 Most of these participants observed that leaving the target range unchanged at this meeting would allow them more time to assess the economy’s progress toward the Committee’s goals of maximum employment and price stability.
" The participants favoring a 25  basis point increase noted that the labor market remained very tight, momentum in economic activity had been stronger than earlier anticipated , and there were few clear signs that inflation was on a path to return to the Committee’s 2 percent objective  over time."
" In discussing the policy outlook, all participants co ntinued to anticipate that, with inflation still well above the Committee’s 2 percent goal and the labor market remaining very tight, maintaining a restrictive stance for monetary policy would be appropriate to achieve the Committee’s objectives."
 Most participants observed that uncertainty about the outlook for the economy and inflation remained elevated and that additional Page 8Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ information would be valuable for considering the appropriate stance of monetary policy.
" Many also noted that, after rapidly tightening the stance of monetary policy last year, the Committee had slowed the pace of tightening and that a further moderation in the pace of policy firming was appropriate in order to provide additional time to observe the effects of cumulative tightening  and assess their implications for policy ."
" Most participants observed that postmeeting communications, including the SEP, would help clarify their assessment regarding the stance of monetary policy that is likely to be appropriate to bring inflation down to 2 percent over time."
" Almost all participants stated that, with inflation still well above the Committee’s longer -run goal and the labor market remaining tight, upside risks to the inflation outlook or the possibility that persistently high inflation might cause inflation expectations to become unanchored remained key factors shaping the policy outlook."
" Even though economic activity had been resilient recently and that the labor market remained strong, some participants commented that there continued to be downside risks to economic growth and upside risks to unemployment."
" Despite the receding of the stresses in the banking sector, some participants commented that it would be important to monitor whether developments in the banking sector lead to further tightening of credit conditions and weigh on economic activity."
