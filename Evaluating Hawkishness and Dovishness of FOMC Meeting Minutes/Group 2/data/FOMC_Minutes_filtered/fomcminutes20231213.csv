" Financial conditions eased, driven by a decline in interest rates, an increase in equity prices, and a depreciation in the dollar."
 The rise in equity prices was supported by the decline in Treasury yields and by earnings growth that exceeded consensus expectations.
"  Yields on nominal Treasury securities declined sharply over the intermeeting period —more so at longer maturities—after having increased notably during the previous intermeeting period, as investors appeared to interpret incoming data as reducing risks of prolonged inflation pressures."
 Pricing of inflation derivatives over the intermeeting period suggested that investors had become more optimistic about the near -term outlook for inflation.
  The manager turned next to expectations for monetary policy.
" As reflected by a rise in the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, t here was some tightening of conditions in repo markets in late November and early December in response to typical lending dynamics around monthend, the settlement of a large amount of Treasury issuance, and increased demand for Treasury financing."
"  As part of their ongoing m arket surveillance, the staff will continue to monitor a wide range of indicators of money market conditions, including the composition of borrowers in money markets, borrowing demand for various sources of liquidity, the distribution of reserve balances across the financial system, the pricing of money  market investments relative to the Federal Reserve’s administered rates, and the sensitivity of money market rates to changes in aggregate reserves."
Staff Review of the Economic Situation  The data available at the time of the December  12–13 meeting suggested that growth in U.S. real gross domestic product (GDP) was slowing from its strong third -quarter pace.
" Labor market conditions continued to be tight, with moderating but still -strong job gains and a low unemployment rate."
 Consumer price inflation had eased over the past year but remained elevated.
 Labor demand and supply continued to move gradually into better alignment.
" Total nonfarm payroll employment expanded at a slower pace, on balance, over October and November than its average monthly rate in the third quarter."
" The unemployment rate was little changed, on net, and stood at 3.7  percent in November, the same as its third -quarter average."
" The labor force participation rate was essentially flat over the past two months, remaining above its level early in the year, while the employmentto-population ratio rose slightly on balance."
" The unemployment rates for African Americans and for Hispanics were little changed, and both rates were higher than those for Asians and for Whites."
" The lessening of labor market imbalances was apparent in recent wage data, as the 12 -month change in average hourly earnings for all employees was well below its year -earlier level and the Wage Growth Tracker constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta was trending down and lower than a year ago."
  Consumer price inflation remained elevated but continued to show notable signs of easing.
" The price index for total personal consumption expenditures (PCE) increased 3.0  percent over the 12  months ending in October, while core PCE inflation—which excludes  changes in energy prices and many consumer food prices —was 3.5 percent over the same period; both total and core Minutes of the Meeting of December 12–13, 2023Page 3_____________________________________________________________________________________________    PCE inflation were well below their year -earlier levels."
" The sixmonth change measures of total and core PCE inflation in October were each 2.5 percent, down from their levels six months earlier."
" The trimmed mean measure of 12month PCE inflation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas was 3.6  percent in Oct ober, also down from its level a year ago."
 Recent survey measures of medium - to longer -term inflation expectations were in the range seen in the decade before the pandemic.
" In contrast, survey measures of consumers’ short -run inflation expectations remained above their pre -pandemic levels."
" Available indicators suggested that real GDP growth was slowing from its strong third -quarter pace, which had been led by a sizable increase in consumer spending."
" In October, PCE growth slowed from its average monthly rate in the third quarter."
" The nominal trade deficit widened in October, as exports declined and imports rose slightly."
" Foreign economic growth slowed in the third quarter, and available indicators pointed to subdued growth in the fourth quarter."
 The significant tightening of monetary policy by foreign central banks over the past two years and the repercussions of last year’s energy shock in Europe continued to weigh on foreign economic activity.
" Chinese economic indicators, such as retail sales and industrial production, pointed to economic growth remaining modest."
" By contrast, economic activity in Asia excluding China stepped up, supported in part by a recovery in industrial production, especially in the hightech sector."
"  While inflation was still elevated in most major economies, incoming data indicated that it had moved down markedly."
 These decreases reflected notable step -downs in both energy and core inflation amid slowing aggregate demand and declines in oil prices.
 Most major foreign central banks kept their policy rates unchanged over the intermeeting period and emphasized the need to maintain a sufficiently restrictive stance of policy to ensure that inflation fell back to their targets.
" Staff Review of the Financial Situation  Over the intermeeting period, some softer -thanex-pected data releases appeared to lessen the perception among investors that policy may need to tighten further in order to bring inflation down to 2 percent over time."
" Market participants also viewed monetary policy communications, on balance, as pointing to somewhat less restrictive policy than expected."
" The decline in nominal yields mostly reflected a decrease in real yields, while measures of inflation compensation were moderately lower, on net, amid softer -thanexpected data releases."
" Measures of uncertainty about the path of interest rates decreased notably, consistent with the tempering of concerns about inflation, but remained elevated by historical standards."
" Spillovers from falling U.S. yields, below -expectations readings on global inflation, and oil price drops led to large declines in foreign yields."
" Rates on loans to households, including those for  30year conforming residential mortgages and new auto loans , declined over the intermeeting period, while interest rates on commercial and industrial (C&I) loans and small business lo ans were little changed."
 Growth of credit card balances moderated significantly through November from the brisk pace seen in the summer.
 The staff continued to expect that GDP growth would slow markedly in the fourth quarter from its outsized third -quarter ra te but that economic growth for 2023 as a whole would still be solid.
" The lagged effects of earlier monetary policy actions, through their contributions to continued tight financial and credit conditions, were expected to show through more fully in restra ining economic activity in the coming years."
 The unemployment rate was expected to be roughly flat through 2026 as the effects of below -potential output growth were offset by the effects of further improvements in labor market functioning.
" The staff revised down their inflation forecast, reflecting lower -thanexpected incoming data—including the November CPI and producer price index —and their judgment that inflation would be less persistent than in the previous projection."
" Measured on a fou rquarter  change basis, total PCE price inflation was expected to be somewhat below 3 percent this year, with core PCE price inflation somewhat above 3 percent."
" Inflation was projected to move lower in coming years as demand and supply in product and labor markets moved into better Minutes of the Meeting of December 12–13, 2023Page 5_____________________________________________________________________________________________    alignment; by 2026, total and core PCE price inflation were expected to be close to 2  percent."
" Risks around the inflation forecast were seen as skewed to the upside, given that inflation was still elevated and the possibility that inflation might prove to be more persistent than expected or that adverse shocks to supply conditions might occur."
 The risks around the forecast for economic activity were viewed to be tilted to the downside.
" In particular, the additional monetary policy tightening that could be put in place if upside inflation risks were to materialize, with the potential for a greater tightening of financial conditions, represented a downside risk to the projection for economic activity."
" Participants ’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook  In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2023 through 2026 and over the longer run."
" The projections were based on their individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy, including the path of the federal funds rate."
" The longer -run projections represented each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy."
" In their discussion of current economic conditions, participants observed that after stronger  than expected growth of real GDP in the third quarter, recent indicators suggested that growth in economic activity had slowed."
" While still strong, job gains had moderated since earlier this year , and the unemployment rate had remained low."
 Participants observed that inflation had eased over the past year but remained elevated and above the Committee’s longer -run goal of 2 percent.
" Regarding the economic outlook, participants generally judged that, in 2024, real GDP growth would cool and that rebalancing of the labor market would continue, with the unemployment rate rising somewhat from its current level."
" Based on better -thanexpected data on inflation, participants revised down their inflation projections for 2023 and, to a lesser extent, in subsequent  years."
 Participants judged that the current stance of monetary policy was restrictive and appeared to be restraining economic activity and inflation.
" In light of the policy restraint in place, along with more favorable data on inflation, participants generally viewed risks to inflation and employment as moving toward greater balance."
" However, participants remained highly attentive to inflation risks."
" In their discussion of inflation, all participants observed that clear progress had been made in 2023 toward the Committee’s 2 percent inflation objective."
" They remained concerned that elevated inflation continued to harm households, especially those with limited means to absorb higher prices."
  Participants observed that inflation remained above the Committee’s objective and that they would need to see more evidence that inflation pressures were abating to become  confident in a sustained return of inflation to 2 percent.
" In reviewing progress to date in reducing inflation, participants noted the improvement in both headline and core inflation and discussed the developments in components of these aggregate measures."
 Several participants observed that the ongoing rebalancing of  labor supply and demand  would help reduce  core services inflation .
 Several participants assessed that housing services inflation would fall further over time as the earlier deceleration in rents on new leases continued to pass through to  broader rent measures .
 Participants also discussed the role played by  various supply and demand factors in the progress on reducing inflation thus far.
" They assessed that t he contribution of improved supply had come from supply chain normalization, boosts to labor supply due to a higher labor force participation rate and immigration, better productivity growth , or increased domestic oil production."
" They also noted that restrictive monetary policy had helped restrain growth of demand, particularly in interest -sensitive sectors such as business fixed investment, housing, and autos and other durable goods."
" Several participants assessed that healing in supply chains and labor supply  was largely complete, and therefore that continued progress in reducing  inflation may need to come mainly from further softening in product and labor demand , with restrictive monetary policy continuing to play a central role."
 Several participants noted that longer -term inflation expectations remained well anchored and that near -term inflation expectations of households had declined recently.
" Page 6Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________    In their comments about the household sector, participants observed that consumer spending had been strong, supported by the healthy balance sheets of  many households, a strong labor market, and robust income growth."
" Retail sales growth had stepped down noticeably in October, though a few participants remarked that contacts reported strong sales in November, notably related to holiday spending."
" Participants mentioned several factors that may contribute to softer consumer spending, including slower growth of labor income and diminishing p andemicrelated  excess savings."
" Reports from participants’ business -sector contacts were mixed, with some contacts remaining relatively optimistic and others expecting slower growth for 2024."
 Several participants observed that higher interest rates were leading firms to reassess future projects and were contributing to softer business investment and hiring.
" A few participants noted that contacts in manufacturing reported slowing growth, while a couple of participants expected that low prices for some commodities and drought conditions would reduce agricultural incomes this year."
" Regarding concerns about CRE, several participants noted that a significant share of properties would need to be refinanced in 2024 against a backdrop of higher interest rates, continued weakness in the office sector, and balance sheet pressures faced by some lenders."
 Many noted that nominal wage growth had continued to slow broadly and that business contacts expected a further reduction in wage growth.
 A few participants observed that payroll growth had slowed substantially since the beginning of the year.
 Participants viewed improvements in labor supply and the easing of labor demand as both having contributed to the labor market coming into better balance.
" Supply had improved because of higher labor force participation and immigration, with continued solid productivity growth also supporting the productive capacity of the economy."
" As evidence for the softening of the growth of labor demand  during 2023, m any participants noted the decline in job openings , and a few remarked on the lower quits rate."
"  Several participants noted the risk that, if labor demand  were to weaken substantially further , the labor market could transition quickly from a gradual easing to a more abrupt downshift in conditions."
" As an upside risk to both inflation and economic activity, participants noted that the momentum of economic activity may be stronger than currently assessed , possibly on account of the continued balance sheet strength of many households ."
 M any participants remarked that an easing in financial conditions beyond what is appropriate could make it more difficult for the Committee to reach its inflation goal.
" Participants also noted other sources of upside risks to inflation, including possible effects on global energy and food prices of geopolitical developments, a potential rebound in core goods prices following  the period  of supply chain improvements , or the effects of nearshoring and onshoring activities on labor demand and inflation."
" Downside risks to economic activity noted by participants included the possibility that effects of past policy tightening may be larger than expected, the risk of a marked weakening of household balance sheets, possible negative spillovers from lower growth in some foreign economies, geopolitical risks, and lingering risks of further tightening in bank credit."
" Relatedly, several participants noted that the weak ness in gross domestic income growth relative to GDP growth over the past few quarters may suggest that economic momentum  during that period  was not as strong as indicated by the  GDP readings."
"In their consideration of appropriate monetary policy actions at this meeting, participants noted that recent indicators suggested that growth of economic activity had slowed from its strong pace in the third quarter."
" Job gains had moderated since earlier in the year but remained strong, the unemployment rate had remained low, and there were continuing signs that supply and demand in the labor market were coming into better balance."
 Inflation had eased over the past year but remained elevated.
" Participants also noted that tighter financial and credit conditions facing households and businesses would likely weigh on economic activity, hiring, and i nflation, although  the extent of these effects Minutes of the Meeting of December 12–13, 2023Page 7_____________________________________________________________________________________________    remained uncertain."
 Participants continued to be resolute in their commitment to bring inflation down to the Committee’s 2 percent objective.
"  In light of current economic conditions  and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation, as well as the balance of risks,  all participants judged it appropriate to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5¼ to 5½ percent at this meeting."
 Participants assessed that maintaining the current policy stance was supported by intermeeting data indicating that inflation had continued to move toward  the Committee’s 2 percent objective and that the labor market had continued to move into better balance .
" Participants pointed to the decline in inflation seen during 2023, noting the recent shift down in sixmonth inflation readings  in particular, and to growing signs of demand and supply coming into better balance in product and labor markets as informing that view."
 Several participants remarked that the Committee’s past policy actions were having their intended effect of helping to slow the growth of aggregate demand and cool labor market conditions.
" They judged that, in combination with improvements in the supply situation, these developments were helping to bring inflation back to 2 percent over time."
" Most participants noted that, as indicated in t heir submissions to the SEP, they expected the Committee’s restrictive policy stance to continue to soften hous ehold and business spending , helping to promote further reductions in inflation over the next few years."
" In their submitted projections, almost all participants indicated that, reflecting the improvements in their  inflation outlooks , their baseline projections  implied that a lower target range for the federal funds rate would be appropriate by the end of 2024."
  Participants generally stressed the importance of maintaining a careful and datadependent approach to making monetary policy decisions and reaffirmed that it would be appropriate for policy to remain at a restrictive stance for some time until inflation was clearly moving down sustainably toward the Committee’s objective.
 Participants saw upside risks to inflation as having diminished but noted that inflation was still well above the Committee’s longer -run goal and that a risk remained that progress toward price stability would stall.
" A number of participants highlighted  the uncertainty associated with how long a restrictive monetary policy stance would need to be maintained , and pointed to the downside risks to the economy that would be associated with an overly  restrictive stance."
" Committee Policy Actions  In their discussions of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that recent indicators suggested that growth of economic activity had slowed from its strong pace in the third quarter."
" Job gains had moderated since Page 8Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________    earlier in the year but remained strong, and the unemployment rate had remained low."

" They also agreed that tighter financial and credit conditions for households and businesses were likely to weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation but that the extent of these effects was uncertain."
 Members agreed that they remained highly attentive to inflation risks.
" In support of the Committee’s objective to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run, members agreed to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5¼ to 5½  percent."
 They also agreed that they would continue to assess additional information and its implications for monetary policy.
" In determining the extent of any additional policy firming that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time, m embers concurred that they would take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments."
 All members affirmed their strong commitment to returning inflation to their 2 percent objective.
" Members agreed that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook."
 They would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if  risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals.
" Members also agreed that their assessments would take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments."
 Members agreed that their postmeeting statement should acknowledge the slowing of economic activity from its strong pace in the third quarter as well as the fact that inflation had eased over the past year but remained elevated.
" Members also agreed to mod ify the sentence in their postmeeting statement discussing the considerations relevant for future policy actions to indicate that the Committee would determine “the extent of any additional policy firming that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time.”  Members generally viewed the addition of the word “any” to this sentence as appropriately relaying their judgment that the target range for the federal funds rate was likely now at or near its peak for  this policy tightening  cycle while leaving open the possibility of further increases in the target range if these were warranted by the totality of the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks."
" Minutes of the Meeting of December 12–13, 2023Page 9_____________________________________________________________________________________________    • Engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve’s agency MBS transactions.”  The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2:00 p.m.:  “Recent indicators suggest that growth of economic activity has slowed from its strong pace in the third quarter."
