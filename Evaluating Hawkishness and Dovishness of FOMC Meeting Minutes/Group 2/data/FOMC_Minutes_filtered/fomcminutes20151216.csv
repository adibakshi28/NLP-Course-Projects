"  Developments in Financial Markets and Open Market Operations  The manager of the System Open Market Account (SOMA) reported on developments in domestic and foreign financial markets, including expectations of market participants for monetary policy action by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) at this meeting an d in the future."
 It was noted that the System’s rever se repurchase (RRP) agreement operations continued to provide a soft floor under shortterm interest rates.
" Consumer price inflation continued to run below the FOMC’s longerrun objective of 2 percent, restrained in part by declines in both energy prices and the prices of nonen-ergy imported goods."
" Some surveybased measures of longerrun inflation expectations edged down, while marketbased measures of inflation compensation were still low."
Total nonfarm payroll employment expanded at a faster monthly rate in October and November than in the third quarter.
" The unemployment rate ticked down to 5.0 percent in October and remained at that level in November; over the 12 months ending in November, the unemployment rate fell ¾ percentage point."
" Both the labor force participation rate and the employmentto-population ratio increased slightly, on net, over October and November."
" Recent measures of the gains in labor compensation were mixed:  Over the four quarters ending in the third quarter, compensation per hour in the business sector advanced at a strong 3½ percent rate, while the employment cost index rose at a more moderate 2 percent pace."
" Household spending was supported by strong growth in real disposable income in September and October, and households’ net worth was bolstered by recent gains in home values."
"Real private expenditures for business equipment and intellectual property products increased at a solid pace in the third quarter, but business spending growth looked to be slowing somewhat in the fourth quarter."
The U.S. international trade deficit widened in October after narrowing in September.
 The available trade data suggested that declines in real net exports would likely continue to be a drag on real GDP growth in the fourth quarter.
" Core PCE inflation, which excludes changes in food and energy prices, was 1¼ percent over the same 12month period, partly restrained by declines in the prices of nonenergy imported goods."
" Over the 12 months ending in November, total consumer prices as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) rose ½ percent, while core CPI inflation was 2 percent."
" Survey measures of expected longerrun inflation were relatively stable, although they showed some hints of having edged slightly lower:  In November and early December, the Michiga n survey measure continued to run somewhat below its typical range of the past 15 years, though historical patterns suggest that these relatively low readings may have reflected softness in total inflation and energy prices."
"Foreign real GDP growth improved in the third quarter after being weak in the first half, and recent indicators were consistent with a further moderate expansion in the fourth quarter."
" Economic activity in Canada rebounded in the third quarter, boosted by rising exports and a smaller drag from declines in oilsector investment."
" In contrast, growth in the euroarea economy slowed in the third quarter."
" Recent indicators for economic activity in China were relatively favorable, and several other emerging Asian economies strengthened in the third quarter."
" Mexican economic growth also picked up in the third quarter, but the Brazilian economy continued to contract."
 Falling energy prices kept headline inflation very low in many foreign economies.
" The October FOMC statement and the strongerthan-expected October employment report, in particular, boosted expectations of FOMC action at this meeting."
The expected path of the federal funds rate implied by market quotes on interest rate derivatives rose moderately over the intermeeting period.
 Measures of inflation compensation based on Treasury InflationPro-tected Securities remained low.
" Issuance of investmentgrade corporate bonds and institutional leveraged loans remained solid, buoyed by demand to finance mergers and acquisitions."
" Growth of commercial and industrial loans on banks’ books  continued to be strong in October and November, driven mainly by the expansion of large loans at large banks."
 The stronger dollar appeared to weigh on earnings growth across many sectors.
" Spreads on commercial mortgagebacked securities (CMBS) widened further, suggesting that investors in CMBS continued to reassess the risks in this sector following several years of robust demand for these securities."
" Interest rates on 30year fixedrate mortgages increased 30 basis points, in line with increases in yields on mortgagebacked securities and comparablematurity Treasury securities."
 Consumer loan balances continued to rise at a robust pace through October because of sustained expansion in credit card balances and sizable increases in auto and student loans; growth of student Page 4Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________  loans continued to slow gradually.
"Staff Economic Outlook  In the economic forecast prepared by the staff for the December FOMC meeting, real GDP growth in the second half of this year was little changed, on net, relative to the projection for the October meeting."
" The staff’s mediumterm projection for real GDP growth was revised up slightly, on balance, from the previous forecast, primarily because the recently passed Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 was anticipated to lead to somewhat higher federal government purchases."
 The unemployment rate was expected to decline gradually and to run somewhat below the staff’s estimate of its longerrun natural rate over this period.
"The staff’s forecast for inflation was revised down slightly in the near term in response to recent data for consumer prices and the further decline in the price of crude oil; over the medium term, the projection was little revised."
 The staff projected that inflation would increase gradually over the next several years and reach the Committee’s longer -run objective of 2 percent by the end of 2018.
"The staff viewed the uncertainty around its December projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as similar to the average of the past                                                  3 The president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis did not participate in this FOMC meeting, and the incoming president is scheduled to assume office on January 1, 2016."
" Consistent with this downside risk to aggregate demand, the staff viewed the risks to its outlook for the unemployment rate as skewed somewhat to the upside."
" The risks to the projection for inflation were seen as weighted to the downside, reflecting the possibility that longerterm inflation expectations may have edged down and that the foreign exchange value of the dollar could rise substantially further, which would put downward pressure on inflation."
"Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, members of the Board of Governors and Federal Reserve Bank presidents submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, inflation, and the federal funds rate for each year from 2015 through 2018 and over the longer run.3  Each participant’s projections were  condition ed on his or her judgment of appropriate monetary policy."
" The longerrun projections represent each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy."
"In their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants viewed the information received over the intermeeting period as indicating that economic activity was expanding moderately and confirming that underutilization of labor resources had diminished appreciably since early in the year."
"  Participants ’ outlook indicated that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, real GDP would continue to increase at a moderate rate over the medium term and that labor market indicators would continue to strengthen."
 They anticipated that the relative strength in domestic demand would be only partially offset by some further weakness in net exports.
" Participants generally saw the downside risks to U.S. economic activity from global economic and financial developments, although still material , as having diminished since late summer."
" In addition, new and revised information on employment James M."
" Accordingly, taking into account domestic and international developments, most participants judged the risks to the outlook for both economic activity and the labor market to be balanced."
"Incoming data indicated that inflation continued to run below the Committee’s 2  percent longerrun objective, partly reflecting declines in energy prices and prices of nonenergy imports."
" The price of crude oil fell further over the intermeeting period, and many participants lowered their nearterm forecasts for inflation somewhat while leaving their mediumterm forecasts little changed."
 Nearly all continued to anticipate that inflation would rise to or very close to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of declines in energy and import prices dissipated and the labor market strengthened further.
" Over the intermeeting period, marketbased measures of inflation compensation stayed low; some surveybased measures of longerterm inflation expectations edged down."
" Although many participants remained concern ed about downside risks attending the outlook for inflation, a majority of participants saw the risks to the outlook for inflation as balanced."
"As a result of the recently passed Bipartisan Budget Act, federal spending was expected to provide a modest boost to economic activity over the next few years."
"  In the agricultural sector, high levels of domestic crop production and weak global demand had depressed commodity prices, and farm income was expected to decline."
"Participants generally agreed that the drag on U.S. economic activity from the appreciation of the dollar since the summer of 2014 and the slowdown in foreign economic growth, particularly in emerging market economies, was likely to continue to depress U.S. net exports for some time."
 Many expressed the view that the risks to the global economy that emerged late this summer had receded and anticipated moderate improvement in economic growth abroad in the coming year as currency and commodity markets stabilized.
" Several participants noted that alternative indicators of underlying inflation, such as the core CPI, the trimmed mean PCE, and the sticky price CPI, showed somewhat higher yearover-year increases, close to or above 2 percent."
" Inflation by these measures, however, had typically run higher than PCE price inflation , and a range of views was expressed about their implications for the outlook for PCE inflation."
"Almost all participants continued to expect that once energy prices and prices of nonenergy commodities stabilized, the effects of the declines in those prices on headline and core PCE inflation would fade."
" Moreover, with margins of resource underutilization having already diminished appreciably and longerrun inflation expectations reasonably stable, most anticipated that tightening resource utilization over the next year would contribute to higher inflation."
 Nearly all participants were now reasonably confident that inflation would move back to 2 percent over the medium term.
"  However, because of the recent further decline in crude oil prices, many participants judged that falling energy prices would depress headline inflation somewhat longer than previously anticipated ."
" Although almost all still expected that the downward pressure on inflation from energy and commodity prices would be transitory, many viewed the persistent weakness in those prices as adding uncertainty or posing important downside risks to the inflation outlook."
"  Recently, some of the available surveys had reported softer longerrun inflation expectations, while others suggested stillstable expectations."
" In addition, the marketbased measures of inflation compensation that had declined earlier were still at low levels."
" A number of participants noted, based on historical patterns, that some of the surveybased measures could be overly sensitive to energy price fluctuations rather than indicating shifts in perceptions of underlying inflation trends and that the declines in the marketbased measures could reflect changes in risk and liquidity premiums."
 Many concluded that longerrun inflation expectations remained reasonably stable.
" However, some expressed concerns that inflation expectations may have already moved lower, or that they might do so if inflation persisted for much longer at a rate below the Committee’s objective."
" Labor market conditions improved further in recent months:  Monthly gains in nonfarm payroll employment averaged more than 200,000 over the period from September to November, and the unemployment rate edg ed lower."
" The unemployment rate, at 5.0 percent in November, was 0.7 percentage point lower than in January and close to most participants’ estimates of its longer -run normal level."
 Broader measures of underemployment that include marginally attached workers and those employed part time for economic reasons also fell substantially since January.
"     Although many participants judged that the improvement in labor market conditions had been substantial , some others indicated that further progress in reducing labor market slack would be required before conditions would be consistent with the Committee’s objective of maximum employment."
" In particular, some participants stressed the importance of the pace of economic growth staying above that of potential output in order to reduce remaining labor underutilization across broader dimensions —for example, by lowering the stillelevated numbers of workers employed part time for economic reasons and by encouraging additional workers who are currently outside the labor force but want a job to reenter the labor force."
"Most participants expected that the unemployment rate would edge below their estimates of its longerrun level in the coming year and then stabilize for a time, with the further strengthening of the labor market helping move inflation higher."
" Because labor compensation was still increasing at a subdued rate and inflation remained well below 2 percent, some participants judged that a moderate further decline in unemployment would be unlikely to lead to a buildup of unduly strong inflation pressures."
"  Minutes of the Meeting of December 15–16, 2015Page 7_____________________________________________________________________________________________  A few commented that a sustained period of labor market activity above levels consistent with maximum employment should speed the rise in inflation to the Committee’s objective."
"During their consideration of economic conditions and monetary policy, almost all participants agreed that the improvements that had occurred in the labor market and their confidence in a return of inflation to 2 percent over the medium term now satisfied the Committee’s criteria for beginning the policy normalization process."
 Normalizing policy gradually would keep the stance of monetary policy sufficiently accommodative to support further improvement in labor market conditions and to exert upward pressure on inflation.
" Also, a number of participants pointed out that because inflation was still running well below the Committee’s objective and the outlook for inflation was subject to considerable uncertainty, it would probably take some time for the data to confirm that inflation was on a trajectory to return to 2 percent over the medium term."
 Gradual adjustments in the federal funds rate would also allow policymakers to assess how the economy was responding to increases in interest rates.
" In addition, by several estimates, the neutral shortterm real interest rate was currently close to zero and was expected to rise only slowly as headwinds restraining the expansion receded."
" Moreover , the ability of monetary policy to offset the economic effects of an unanticipated economic shock  remained   asymmetric,  and  a cautious approach to normalizing policy could help minimize the risk of having to respond to a negative economic shock while the policy rate remained near its effective lower bound."
" They stressed the importance of communicating clearly that the future policy path could become shallow er if the economic expansion weakened and inflation rose more slowly than currently anticipated, and that it could become steeper if real activity and inflation surprised to the upside."
"Committee Policy Action  In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that information received since the FOMC met in October indicated that economic activity had been expanding at a moderate pace."
" Overall, taking into account domestic and foreign developments, members saw the risks to the outlook for both economic activity and the labor market as balanced, and they expect ed that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity would most likely continue to expand at a moderate pace."
"Members agreed that a range of recent labor market indicators, including ongoing job gains and declining unemployment, showed further improvement and confirmed that underutilization of labor resources had diminished appreciably since early this year."
" Members anticipated that economic activity was likely to continue to expand at a pace sufficient to lead to a further increase in the utilization of labor resources, and many members judged that additional progress would be required to reach the Committee’s ma ximumemployment objective."
"Inflation continued to run below the Committee’s longerrun objective, held down in part by the effects of declines in energy and nonenergy import prices."
      Marketbased measures of inflation compensation remained low; some surveybased measures of longerterm inflation expectations had edged down.
 Members anticipated that the further decline in crude oil prices Page 8Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________  over the intermeeting period was likely to exert some additional transitory downward pressure on inflation in the near term.
"Regarding the mediumterm outlook, inflation was projected to increase gradually as energy prices and prices of nonenergy imports stabilized and the labor market strengthen ed."
" Overall, taking into account economic developments and the outlook for economic activity and the labor market, the Committee was now reasonably confident in its expectation that inflation would rise, over the medium term, to its 2 percent objective."
" However, for  some members, the risks attending their inflation forecasts remained considerable."
 Among those risks was the possibility that additional downward shocks to prices of oil and other commodities or a sustained rise in the exchange value of the dollar could delay or diminish the expected upturn in inflation.
 A couple also worried that a further strengthening of the labor market might not prove sufficient to offset the downward pressures from global disinflationary forces.
 And several expressed unease with indications that inflation expectations may have moved down slightly.
" In view of these risks and the shortfall of inflation from 2 percent , members expressed their intention to carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward the Committee’s inflation goal."
"After assessing the outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation and weighing the uncertainties associated with the outlook, members agreed to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to ¼ to ½ percent at this meeting."
 A number of members commented that it was appropriate to begin policy normalization in response to the substantial progress in the labor market toward achieving the Committee’s objective of maximum employment and their reasonable confidence that inflation would move to 2 percent over the medium term.
" If the Committee waited to begin removing accommodation until it was closer to achieving its dualmandate objectives, it might need to tighten policy abruptly, which could risk disrupting economic activity."
" Members observed that after this initial increase in the federal funds rate, the stance of monetary policy would remain accommodative."
" However, some members said that their decision to raise the target range was a close call, particularly given the uncertainty about inflation dynamics, and emphasized the need to monitor the progress of inflation closely."
" Based on their current forecasts for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, as well as the ir expectation that the neutral shortterm real interest rate will rise slowly over the next few years, members expected economic conditions would evolve in a manner that would warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate."
" In the current situation, b ecause of the ir significant concern about stilllow readings on actual inflation and the uncertainty and risks present in the inflation outlook, they agreed to indicate that the Committee would carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal."
" In determining the size and timing of further adjustments to monetary policy, some members emphasized the importance of confirming that inflation would rise as projected and of maintaining the credibility of the Committee’s inflation objective."
" In view of members’ outlook for moderate growth in economic activity, inflation moving toward its target only gradually, and the asymmetric risks posed by the continued proximity of shortterm interest rates to their effective lower bound, the Committee anticipated retaining this policy until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate was well under way."
 The Committee also directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve’s agenc y mortgagebacked securities transactions.”  The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p.m.: “Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in October suggests that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace.
" A range of recent labor market indicators, including ongoing job gains and declining unemployment, shows further improvement and confirms that underutilization of labor resources has diminished appreciably since early this year."
" Inflation has continued to run below the Committee’s 2  percent longerrun objective, partly reflecting declines in energy prices and in prices of nonenergy imports."
 Marketbased measures of inflation compensation remain low; some survey-based measures of longerterm inflation expectations have edged down.
"Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
" The Committee currently expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will continue to expand at a moderate pace and labor market indicators will continue to strengthen."
" Overall, taking into account domestic and international developments, the Committee sees the risks to the outlook for both economic activity and the labor market as balanced."
 Inflation is expected to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further.
 The Committee continues to monitor inflation developments closely.
"The Committee judges that there has been considerable improvement in labor market conditions this year, and it is reasonably confident that inflation will rise, over the medium term, to its 2 percent objective."
" The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative after this increase, thereby supporting further improvement in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation."
"In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation."
" This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
" In light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, the Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal."
"To support the Committee’s decision to raise the target range for the federal funds rate, the Board of Governors voted unanimously to raise the interest rates on required and excess reserve balances by ¼ percentage point, to ½ percent, effective December 17, 2015."
"Minutes of the Meeting of December 15–16, 2015Page 11_____________________________________________________________________________________________  Summary of Economic Projections  In conjunction with the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting held on December 15–16, 2015, meeting participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real output growth, the unemployment rate, inflation, and the federal funds rate for each year from 2015 to 2018 and over the longer run.1  Each participant’s projection was based on information available at the time of the meeting, together with his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy and assumptions about the factors likely to affect economic outcomes."
" The longerrun projections represent each participant’s assessment of the value to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy."
 “Appropriate monetary policy” is defined as the futu re path of policy that each participant deems most likely to foster outcomes for economic activity and inflation that best satisfy his or her individual interpretation of the Federal Reserve’s objectives of maximum employment and stable prices.
"FOMC participants generally expected that, under appropriate monetary policy, real gross domestic product (GDP) growth in 2016 and 2017 would be at or somewhat above their individual estimates of the longerrun growth rate and would converge toward its longerrun rate in 2018 (table 1 and figure  1)."
 All participants projected that the unemployment rate would decline further in 2016.
 Most participants expected that in 2018 the unemployment rate would remain somewhat below their individual judgments of its longerrun normal rate.
" Participants projected that inflation, as measured by the fourquarter change  in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), would pick up in 2016 and 2017 from the very low r ate seen in 2015."
 Almost all participants projected inflation in 2018 to be at or very near the Committee’s 2 percent objective.
" Most participants expected that it wo uld be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate gradually over the projection period as headwinds to economic growth dissipate slowly over time and as inflation rises toward                                                  1 The president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis did not participate in this FO MC meeting, and the incoming president is scheduled to assu me office on January 1, 2016."
Almost all participants viewed the levels of uncertainty associated with their outlooks for economic growth and the unemployment rate as broadly similar to the norms of the previous 20 years.
 Nearly all also viewed the levels of uncertainty associated with their inflation forecasts as broadly similar to historical norms.
 Most participants saw the risks to their outlooks for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate as broadly balanced.
" A majority viewed the risks attending their projections for both PCE and core PCE inflation as broadly balanced, but many saw these risks as we ighted to th e downside."
" Among those who saw the risks to their inflation outlook as tilted to the downside, several highlighted the continued strength of the do llar and some recent indications that inflation expectations had declined as contributing to those risks."
"The Outlook for Economic Activity Participants generally projected that, conditional on their individual assumptions about appropriate monetary policy, real GDP would increase in 2016 and 2017 at a pace somewhat above their estimates of its longerrun rate."
 Real GDP growth would then slow in 2018 to a rate at or near their individual estimates of the longerrun normal rate.
" Participants pointed to a number of factors that they expect will contribute to moderate output growth over the next few years, including labor market conditions that are supportive of economic expansion, household and business balance sheets that had improved significantly since the financial crisis, and a stance of monetary policy that was expected to remain accommodative."
"Compared with their contributions to the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) in September, participants’ projections of real GDP growth from 2016 to 2018 were generally little changed."
" Th e median value of participants’ projections for real  GDP growth in 2016 was revised up slightly to 2.4 percent; some participants cited the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, which was passed in James M."

" Very few participants changed their forecasts for real GDP growth in the longer run, resulting in an unchanged median."
All participants projected that the unemployment rate would be at or below their in dividual judgments of its longerrun normal level from 2016 through 2018.
" Compared with the September SEP, most participants’ projected paths for the unemployment rate were revised down a little over those three years, with the median of the projections in the fourth quarter of each year at 4.7 percent."
" Many also revised down slightly their estimates of the longerrun normal rate of unemployment, although the median forecast of 4.9 percent was unchanged since September."
 Participants generally cited strongerthan-expected labor market data in recent months as a factor explaining the downward revisions to their unemployment rate forecasts.
Figures 3.A and 3.B show the distribution of participants’ views regarding the likely outcomes for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate through 2018 and in the longer run.
 The distributions of the projections for real GDP growth over the next several years and in the longer run narrowed some since the September SEP.
" The diversity of views across participants on the outlook for GDP growth reflected, in part, differences in their individual assessments of the size and persistence of the effects of lower energy prices and a stronger dollar on real activity; the time it would take for the headwinds that have been restraining the pace of the economic expansion, such as financial and economic conditions abroad, to dissipate; and the appropriate path of monetary policy."
" With regard to the unemployment rate, the distributions of projections over the next three years shifted modestly to lowe r values since September."
" The Outlook for Inflation Nearly all participants saw PCE price inflation picking up in 2016, rising further in 2017, and then reaching a rate in 2018 at or very close to the Committee’s 2 percent longerrun objective."
" However, relative to the September SEP, almost all participants marked down their projections for PCE price infl ation in 2016, observing that recent declines in energy prices and the continued strength in the dollar could exert additional downward pressure on inflation in the near term."
" Revisions to participants’ inflation forecast s in 2017 were more mixed, while the projections for in flation in 2018 were little changed."
" Most participants also marked down their projections for core PCE price inflation in 2016, although almost all still expected core  inflation to rise gradually over the projection period and to be at or very close to 2 percent by 2018."
" Factors ci ted by participants as contributing to their outlook that inflation will rise over the medium term included recent signs of a pickup in wage growth, their expectation of tighter resource utilization, their expectation that the effects of recent appreciation in the dollar and declines in oil prices on inflation will fade, their anticipation that inflation expectations will remain at levels consistent with the FOMC’s longerrun objective, and stillaccommod ative monetary policy."
Figures 3.C and 3.D provide information on the distribution of participants’ views about the outlook for inflation.
" The distribution of participants’ projections for PCE price inflation in 2016 and 2017 shifted to the left compared with the September SEP, while the distributions of projections for 2018 an d in the longer run were little changed."
 The distributions of projections for core PCE price inflation moved lower for 2016 and 2017 compared with September but did not change for 2018.
Appropriate Monetary Policy Figure 3.E provides the distribution of participants’ judgments regarding the appropriate level of the target federal funds rate at the end of each calendar year from 2015 to 2018 and over the longer run.
" Given their expectations that economic headwinds will persist and that inflation will rise gradually to 2 percent over the next three years, most participants judged that it would be appropriate for the federal fund s rate to remain below its longerrun normal level from 2016 to 2018."
" Participants projected that a gradual rise in the federal funds rate over that period would be appropriate as some of those headwinds, such as sluggish foreign economic growth, diminish and the temporary factor s holding down inflation dissipate."
 Some participants noted that a gradual increase in the federal funds rate would be consistent with their expectation that the neutral shortterm real interest rate will rise slowly over the next few years.

Participants’ views of the appropriate path for monetary policy were informed by their judgments about the state of the economy and the outlook for labor markets and inflation.
" Another was prospects for inflation to return to the Committee’s objective of 2  percent; in making such assessments, participants considered a range of factors, including measures of inflation compensation and longerrun inflation expectations as well as the likely persistence and size of the effects from low energy prices and the strong dollar."
Participants also emphasized the potential for international developments to cont inue to have important implications for domestic economic activity and inflation and thus for appropriate monetary policy.
" In addition, given the continued proximity of shortterm interest rates to their effective lower bound, asymmetric risks around the outlook for employment and inflation were noted as one reason why a gradual approach to raising the federal funds rate may be appropriate."
"Uncertainty and Risks  As in the September SEP, nearly all participants continued to judge the levels of uncertainty around their projections for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate as broadly similar to the average level of the past 20 years (figure 4).2  Most participants saw the risks to their outlooks for real GDP growth and unemployment as broadly bal anced, as the number of participants who viewed the risks to economic growth as weighted to the downside  and  the  risks  to  the  unemployment rate as 2 Table 2 provides estimates of the forecast uncertainty for the change in real GDP, the unemployment rate, and total consumer price inflation over the period from 1995 through 2014."
Diminis hed risks to domestic economic activity from developments abroad and the strength of recent labor market data were among the reasons noted for the more upbeat assessment of risks.
"As in the September SEP, participants generally agreed that the levels of uncertainty associated with their inflation forecasts were broadly similar to the average level over the past 20 years."
" The number of participants who viewed the risks to their inflation forecasts as weighted to the downside declined s lightly since September, and a majority now viewed the risks to both PCE and core PCE inflation as broadly balanced."
" Among those who saw risks to inflation as tilt ed to the downside, several highlighted the continued strength of the dollar and some recent indications that inflation expectations had declined as contributing to their perception of those risks."

" Thus, in setting the stance of monetary policy, participants consider not only what appears to be the most likely economic outcome as embodied in their projections, but also the range of alternative possibilities, the likelihood of their occurring, and the potential costs to the economy should they occur."
"Table 2 summarizes the average historical accuracy of a range of forecasts, including those reported in past Monetary Policy Report s and those prepared by the Federal Reserve Board’s staff in advance of meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee."
" The corresponding 70 percent confidence intervals for overall inflation would be 1.8 to 2.2 percent in the current year, and     1.0 to 3.0 percent in the second, third, and fourth years."
"As with real activity and inflation, the outlook for the future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable uncertainty."
 This uncertainty arises primarily because each participant’s assessment of the appropriate stance of monetary policy depends importantly on the evolution of real activity and inflation over time.
