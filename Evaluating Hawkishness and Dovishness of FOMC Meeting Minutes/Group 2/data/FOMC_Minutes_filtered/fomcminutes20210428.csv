"After rising sharply in recent months, longerterm Treasury yields declined modestly over the intermeeting period, even as market expectations for U.S. growth continued to be revised higher."
 Recent financial market developments across advanced economies reflected differing  expectations for economic growth and monetary policy.
" Ho wever, amid ongoing strong demand for safe shortterm investments and reduced Treasury bill supply, the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) stood at 1 basis point throughout the period."
" Nearly all participants commented that a standing repo facility, by acting as a backstop, could help address pressures in the markets for U.S. Treasury securities and Treasury repo that could spill over to other funding markets and impair the implementation and transmission of monetary policy."
" In this regard, a number of participants noted the potential for pressures in shortterm funding markets to arise from time to time, even with monetary policy operating in an amplereserves regime."
" A few participants noted that a standing repo facility could provide counterparties with additional  flexibility in managing the composition of their holdings of highquality liquid assets, potentially reducing the demand for reserves."
 A few participants cautioned that establishing a standing repo facility should not be viewed as a way of implementing monetary policy without an ample supply of reserves.
  Staff Review of the Economic Situation The COVID19 pandemic and the measures undertaken to contain its spread continued to affect economic activity in the United States and abroad.
" Labor market conditions improved markedly in March, though employment remained well below its level at the start of 2020."
"Total nonfarm payroll employment surged in March, with a notable gain in the leisure and hospitality sector."
" As of March, payroll employment had retraced almost twothirds of the losses seen at the onset of the pandemic."
" The unemployment rate declined to 6 percent in March, as the number of workers on temporary layoff continued to fall and the number on permanent layoff ticked down."
" Although the unemployment rates for African Americans and Hispanic s fell, both rates remained well above the national average; in addition, the Asian unemployment rate moved up and was equal to the national average in March."
" The labor force participation rate and employmentto-population ratio increased in March, though both measures remained below their prepandemic levels."
" Initial claims for unemployment insurance had moved down, on net, since midMarch and were at the lowest level since the beginning of the pandemic, though they remained exceptionally high by prepandemic standards."
" Weekly estimates of privatesector payrolls constructed by Federal Reserve Board staff using data provided by the payroll processor ADP, which were available through the first half of April, suggested that the rate of increase in private employment had slowed somewhat relative to  its earlier robust pace."
Total PCE price inflation was 1.6 percent over the 12 months ending in February and continued to be held down by low rates of resource utilization.
" Core PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in consumer energy prices and many consumer food prices, was 1.4 percent over the 12 months ending in February, while the trimmed mean measure of 12month PCE inflation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas was 1.6 percent in February."
" In  March, the 12month change in the consumer price index (CPI) was 2.6 percent, boosted by increases in consumer energy prices, while core CPI inflation was 1.6 percent over the same period."
" In the first quarter of 2021, the staff’s common inflation expectations index, which combines information from many indicators of inflation expectations and inflation compensation, had returned to the level that prevailed in 2018."
" Although existing home sales fell in February and March, the declines appeared to reflect continued limited availability of homes for sale rather than weakening demand; in addition, February’s drop in new home sales was retraced in March."
Data for February showed a wider nominal U.S. international trade deficit than in January.
"Incoming data were consistent with a sharp slowdown in foreign economic growth in the first quarter, following a tightening of socialdistancing restrictions to contain new waves of COVID19 infections."
 The most recent indicators showed that economic activity in many advanced foreign economies (AFEs) resumed expanding toward the end of the first quarter amid a partial easing of restrictions.
" Foreign headline inflation rose consider ably, boosted by temporary factors, such as the fading effects of steep price declines seen early last year and the passthrough of price increases for oil and other commodities."
" However, underlying inflationary pressures appeared to have remained muted."
" The nominal Treasury yield curve was little changed, as were measures of inflation compensation."
"Factors that had stressed fore ign financial markets earlier this year—rising U.S. interest rates, resurging COVID19 cases, and renewed lockdowns in a number of countries—appeared less concerning to global investors over the intermeeting period."
 Banks also reported that demand for C&I loans weakened at large and middlemarket firms and was basically un changed at small firms.
" Financing conditions for small businesses a ppeared to have improved, with demand for loans remaining subdued."
" Interest rates offered to nonprime borrowers continued to rise through February, with the fraction of these offers with zero introductory rates continuing to decline."
" House price growth increased further, with house prices outpacing rents."
" Real GDP growth was projected to post a substantial increase this year, with a correspondingly rapid decline in the unemployment rate, as further reductions in social distancing and favorable financial conditions were expected to support output growth."
" With the boost to growth from continued reductions in social distancing assumed to fade after 2021, GDP growth was expected to step down in 2022 and 2023."
" However, with monetary policy assumed to remain highly accommodative, the staff continued to anticipate that real GDP growth would outpace that of potential over much of this period, leading to a de cline in the unemployment rate to historically low levels."
The staff’s outlook for inflation was broadly unchanged.
" Core inflation was expected to ease some later in the year but to remain above 2 percent at the end of 2021, boosted by large increases in import prices, a recovery in prices that had been especially affected by the pandemic, and the temporary effects of supply bottlenecks."
" Inflation was then projected to dip slightly below 2 percent in 2022 as the in fluence of these transitory factors diminished, before re turning to 2 percent by the end of 2023, supported by sustained tight levels of resource utilization in labor and product markets."
The staff continued to judge that the risks to the baseline projection for economic activity were skewed to the downside and that the uncertainty around the forecast was elevated.
 The staff continued to view the risks around the inflation projection as balanced.
" On the upside, bottlenecks, supply disruptions, and historically high rates of resource utilization were seen as potent ial sources of greaterthan-expected inflationary pressures."
" Alternatively, the possibility that inflation would be held down by low underlying trend inflation and a weakerthan-expected response to resource utilization was seen as an important downside risk."
" Amid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment had strengthened."
" Inflation had risen, largely reflecting transitory factors."
"Participants observed that economic activity had picked up sharply this year, with robust gains in consumer spending, housingsector activity, business equipment investment, and manufacturing production."
 They noted that the acceleration in economic activity reflected positive developments associated with the rapid pace of vaccinations as well as continued support from fiscal and monetary policies.
" Neverthe less, participants generally noted that the economy remained far from the Committee’s maximumemployment and pricestability goals."
" Many participants commented that fiscal stimulus, accommodative financial conditions, the release of pentup demand, progress on widespread vaccination, and the ongoing reduction of socialdistancing measures were important factors supporting spending."
" Several participants observed that housing market activity continued to be strong, supported in part by low interest rates."
" Job gains in the March employment report were strong, and the unemployment rate fell to 6.0 percent."
" Even so, participants judged that the economy was far from achieving the Committee’s broadbase d and inclusive maximumemployment goal."
 Payroll employment was 8.4 million jobs below its prepandemic level.
" Many participants also remarked that business contacts in their Districts reported having trouble hiring workers, likely reflecting factors such as early retirements, health concerns, child care responsibilities, and expanded unemployment insurance benefits."
" Based on reports fr om business contacts, some participants noted that the stepup in demand for labor had started to put some upward pressure on wages."
" Moreover, over the medium term, participants expected labor market conditions to continue to improve, supported by accommodative fiscal and monetary policies as well as continued progress on vaccinations, unwinding of social distancing, and the associated recovery in economic activity."
" A couple of participants remarked that businesses in industries severely affected by the pandemic were downsizing or that some businesses were focused on cutting costs or increasing productivity, particularly through automation."
"  In their comments about inflation, participants anticipated that inflation as measured by the 12month change of the PCE price index would move above 2 percent in the near term as very low readings from early in the pandemic fall out of the calculation."
" Participants also noted that the expected surge in demand as the economy reopens further, along with some transitory supply chain bottlenecks, would contribute to PCE price inflation temporarily running somewhat above 2 percent."
" After the transitory effects of these factors fade, participants generally expected measured inflation to ease."
" Looking further ahead, participants expected inflation to be at levels consistent with achieving the Committee’s objectives over time."
" Despite the expected shortrun fluctuations in measured inflation, many participants commented that various measures of longerterm inflation expectations remained well anchored at levels broadly consistent with achieving the Committee’s longerrun goals."
" As upside ri sks, some participants mentioned that the release of pentup demand, accumulated excess household savings, and rapid progress on vaccinations, amid continued fiscal and monetary support, _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of April 27–28, 2021Page 9could boost economic activity and bring individuals back into the labor force more quickly than currently expected."
 Some participants mentioned upside risks around the inflation outlook that could arise if temporary factors influencing inflation turned out to be more persistent than expected.
Various participants commented on the prolonged period of low interest rates and highly accommodative financial market conditions and the possibility for these conditions to lead to reachfor-yield behavior that could raise financial stability risks.
"  In their consideration of the stance of monetary policy, participants reaffirmed th e Federal Reserve’s commitment to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy during this challenging time, thereby promoting the Committee’s statutory goals of maximum employment and price stability."
" Consequently, participants judged that the current stance of policy and policy guidance remained appropriate to foster further economic recovery as well as to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time and longerterm inflation expectations that continue to be well anchored at 2 percent."
 Participants also noted that the existing outcomebased guidance implied that the path of the federal funds rate and the balance sheet would depend on actual progress toward reaching the Committee’s maximumemploymen t and inflation goals.
" However, a couple of participants commented on the risks of inflation pressu res building up to unwelcome levels before they become sufficiently evident to induce a policy reaction."
"Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that the COVID19 pandemic was causing tremendous human and economic hardship across the United States and around the world."
" They noted that amid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment had strengthened."
" Inflation had risen, largely reflecting transitory factors."
"Members agreed that the Federal Reserve was committed to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximumemployment and pri cestability goals."
" All members reaffirmed that, in  accordance with the Committee’s goals to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run and with inflation running persistently below this longerrun goal, they would aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longerterm inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent."
 Members expected to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until those outcomes were achieved.
"All members agreed to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ per cent, and they expected that it would be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions had reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assess ments of maximum employment and inflation had risen to 2 percent and was on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time."
"Members agreed that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and that they would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate in the event that risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals."
" Members also concurred that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments."
"Members agreed that the postmeeting statement should acknowledge that indicators of economic activity and employment had strengthened but that, despite showing improvement, the sectors of the economy most affected by the pandemic remained weak."
" Members also judged that, while risks to the outl ook remained, continued progress on vaccinations and accommodative monetary and fiscal policies most likely wo uld underpin further gains in economic activity and employment and would limit risks to the outlook."
" With regard to the characterization of inflation, members agreed that the statement should note that inflation had risen but that the increase largely reflected transitory factors."
 They noted that inflation as measured by the 12month change of the PCE price index was expected to move above 2 percent as the very low readings from early in the pandemic fell out of the calculation and as past increases in oil prices passed through to consumer energy prices.
" The expected rebound in spending as the economy continued to reopen was also likely to boost inflat ion temporarily, particularly if supply bottlenecks limited how quickly production could respond to demand in the near term."
" However, members also viewed these increases in prices as likely to have only transitory  effects on inflation."
" Engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary  to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve’s agency MBS transactions.” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2:00 p.m.: “The Federal Reserve is committed to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time , thereby promoting its maximum employment and price stability goals."
" Amid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened."
" Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors."
The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run.
" With inflation running persistently below this longerrun goal, the Committee will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer ‑term inflation expectations re main well anchored at 2 percent."
 The Committee expects to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomes are achieved.
 The Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessments of maximum  employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.
" In addition, the Federal Reserve will continue to increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency mortgage‑backed securities by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward the Committee’s maximum employment and price stability goals."
"In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of in coming information for the economic outlook."
 The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals.
" The Committee’s assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financia l and international developments.” Voting for this action:   Jerome H."
"Consistent with the Committee’s decision to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the Board of Governors voted unanimously to leave the interest rates on required and excess reserve balances at 0.10 percent."
