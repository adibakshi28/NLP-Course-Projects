 The design considerations were gui ded by Page 2Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________   participants’ general desire to have these facilities play a backstop role in fostering effective implementation of monetary policy and supporting smooth functioning of markets.
" Lower term premiums appeared to be a significant component of the declines, as reflected by lower implied volatility on longer -term interest rates."
" Over the period, market participants focused on data showing lower employment growth and higher inflation readings than had been expected."
 The median 2021 core personal consumption expenditures ( PCE) inflation forecast from  the Open Market Desk’s Survey of P rimary Dealers jumped nearly 1 percentage point from the previous survey.
" However, median forecasts for 202 2 and 2023 each rose less than 0.1 percent, suggesting expectations for inflationary pressures to subside."
" Inflation compensation as measured by five -year breakeven rates on Treasury InflationProtected Securities peaked in mid -May at the highest level in  more than a decade, but the increase was driven almost entirely by higher inflation compensation at short horizons."
" Indeed, one -yearforward inflation compensation at horizons beyond a year  was relatively stable."
 Banks continued to limit growth in their balance sheets by allowing wholesale liabilities to mature and encouraging customers to shift some nonoperational deposits to money market funds.
"  Amid heightened demand and reduced supply for short -term investments, the ON RRP continued to maintain a floor on overnight rates."
" Growth in the ON RRP and other nonreserve liabilities helped expand the base of Federal Reserve liabilities supporting asset purchases, damping the increase in reserves and easing pressure on bank balance sheets."
" Consumer price inflation through April —as measured by the 12 -month percentage change in the PCE price index —had picked up notably, largely reflecting transitory factors."
" Total nonfarm payroll employment increased solidly over April and May, though at a slower monthly pace than over February and March."
" As of May, total payroll employment had retraced two -thirds of the job losses seen at the onset of the pandemic, although employment in the leisure and hospitality sector and in the education sector (including both public and private education) had bounced back by less."
" Over April and May, the unemployment rate edged down and stood at 5.8 percent in May."
" The unemployment rates for African Americans, Asians, and Hispanics also moved down, although the rates for Afri can Americans and Hispanics remained well above the national average."
" Both the labor force participation rate and the employment -topopulation ratio moved up slightly, and  both measures ha d recovered only partially from their lows during  the pandemic."
" Initial claims for regular state unemployment insurance benefits had moved down further since mid -April and were at the lowest level since the beginning of the pandemic, though they remained high relative to their pre -pandemic level."
" Weekly estimates of pri vatesector payrolls constructed by Federal Reserve Board staff using data provided by the payroll processor ADP, which were available through May, suggested that the pace of private employment gains had stepped up late in that month."
" The employment cost index of total hourly compensation in the private sector increased at an annual rate of 4  percent in the three months ending in March, a notably faster pace than over the previous three months."
"  Recent 12 -month change measures of inflation, using either PCE prices or the consumer price index (CPI), were boosted significantly by the base effects of the drop in  prices from the spring of 2020 rolling out of the calculation."
" In addition, a surge in demand as the economy reopened further, combined with production bottlenecks and supply constraints, contributed to the large recent Minutes of the Meeting of June 15–16, 2021Page 5_____________________________________________________________________________________________   monthly price increases."
 Total PCE price  inflation was 3.6 percent over the 12  months ending in April.
" Core PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in consumer energy prices and many consumer food prices, was 3.1 percent over the 12  months ending in April."
" In contrast, the trimmed mean mea sure of 12 -month PCE inflation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas was 1.8 percent in April."
" In May, the 12 -month change in the CPI was 5  percent, while core CPI inflation was 3.8 percent over the same period."
" In the second quarter, the sta ff’s common inflation expectations index, which combines information from many indicators of inflation expectations and inflation compensation, had returned to the level that prevailed in 2014, a time when inflation was modest."
"  The components of the nominal retail sales data that are used to estimate PCE edged down in May, but the sales data for the previous two months were revised up markedly, pointing to stronger real PCE growth than had been initially estimated."
" Combined with reduced social distancing and more widespread vaccinations, key factors that influence consumer spending —including increasing job gains, the upward trend in real disposable income, high levels of household net worth, and low interest rates —pointed to strong real PCE growth over the rest of the year."
"  Housing demand continued to be robust, with construction of single -family homes and home sales remaining well above their pre -pandemic levels and house prices rising appreciably further."
 The nominal U.S. international trade deficit widened to a record size in March and then reversed that widening in April.
 Recent data pointed to a pickup in foreign economic activity in the second quarter.
 Demand improved as  social -distancing restrictions were lifted in the United Kingdom and the euro area following the rollout of vaccines.
" Consumer price inflation continued to rise in many foreign economies, primarily driven by rebounding energy prices and the fading effects of steep price declines seen early last year."
" Price increases were concentrated in relatively few items, suggesting that underlying inflationary pressures remained subdued amid considerable economic slack."
" Staff Review of the Financial Situation  Overall financial conditions eased during the intermeeting period a s market participants appeared to remain confident that the economic recovery was broadly on track, that inflation over the medium term would stay contained, and that monetary policy would remain accommodative."
" Measures of inflation compensation at shorter horizons moved down somewhat, on net, while measures of longer -term inflation compensation were little changed."
 Inflation compensation declined a bit at shorter horizons but held steady at longer horizons.
  International financial market  participant s were focused on news about inflation and monetary policy communications.
" In Europe, stronger -thanexpected readings for both inflation and economic activity, as well as increased optimism about vaccinations, contributed to a rise in market -based measures of inflation expectations."
 Tepid demand for loans appears to have been a factor in the decline in loans outstanding.
" For instance, despite healthy growth in C&I commitments at large banks over the first quarter, there was no corresponding change in the utilization rates of credit lines."
" Financing conditions for small businesses were little changed, with supply of small business loans remaining tight and demand still subdued outside of the PPP."
" While small business loan originations rose in April, surpassing pre -pandemic levels, loans made under the PPP likely accounted  for a significant portion of that growth."
" CRE loan growth at banks continued to be weak through mid -May, likely reflecting weak demand as well as tight underwriting standards."
" Consumer loans grew at a robust pace in April, driven by rapid growth in auto loan balances."
" Real GDP growth was projected to increase substantially this year, with a correspondingly rapid decline in the unemployment rate."
" Further reductions in social distancing and favorable financial conditions wer e expected to support output growth, even though the effects of  fiscal stimulus on economic growth were  starting to unwind."
" With the boost to growth from continued reductions in social distancing assumed to fade after 2021 and the further unwinding of fis cal stimulus, GDP growth was expected to step down in 2022 and 2023."
" Nevertheless, with monetary policy assumed to remain highly accommodative, the staff continued to anticipate that real GDP growth would outpace that of potential over most of this period, leading to a decline in the unemployment rate to historically low levels."
" The staff’s near -term outlook for inflation was revised up markedly, but the staff continued to expect the rise in inflation this year to be transitory."
" The 12 -month change i n total and core PCE prices had moved well above 2 percent in April , and incoming CPI data suggested that PCE price inflation would remain high in May."
 The recent 12 -month measures of inflation were being boosted significantly by the base effects of the drop in prices from the spring of 2020 rolling out of the calculation.
" In addition, the surge in demand as the economy reopened further, combined with production bottlenecks and supply constraints, contributed to the large recent monthly price increases."
" The staff expected the 12 -month change in PCE prices to gradually move down in coming months, reflecting , importantly , the fading of base effects along with smaller expected monthly price increases, but PCE price inflation was forecast to still be well abo ve 2 percent at the end of this year."
" Over the next year, the transitory price increases caused by bottlenecks and supply constraints were expected to largely reverse , and the growth in demand was forecast to ease."
" As a result , inflation was projected to  slow to slightly below 2  percent in 2022 before moving back up to a bit above 2  percent in 2023, supported by high levels of resource utilization."
" Nevertheless, the staff judged that the risks around their strong baseline projection for economic activity w ere still tilted somewhat to the downside, as adverse alternative courses of the pandemic —including the possibility of the spread of more -contagious, more -vaccine -resistant COVID -19 variants —seemed more likely than outcomes that would be more favorable than in the baseline forecast."
 The staff continued to view the risks around the inflation projection as roughly balanced.
" On the upside, bottlenecks, supply disruptions, and historically high rates of resource utilization were seen as potential sources of g reater -thanexpected inflationary pressures, particularly if there were a significant rise in inflation expectations that altered inflation dynamics."
" On the downside, if the effects of supply constraints proved to be transitory , as expected , then the infl ation record from the past 25 years suggested the possibility that low underlying trend inflation and a flat Phillips curve could cause inflation to revert to relatively low levels despite a strengthening economy."
" Participants’ Views on Current Economic Co nditions and the Economic Outlook  In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2021 through 2023 and over the longer run, based on their individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy, including the path of the federal funds rate."
" The longer -run projections represented each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy."
" Amid this progress and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment had strengthened."
" Inflation had risen, largely reflecting transitory factors."
" Participants observed that economic activity was expanding at a historically rapid pace, led by robust gains in consumer spending."
" A vast majority of participants revised up their projections for real GD P growth this year compared with the projections they had submitted in March, citing stronger consumer demand and improvements in vaccination rates as the primary reasons for these upgrades."
"  That said, participants generally saw supply disruptions and labor shortages as constraining the expansion of economic activity  this year ."
 Participants’ projections of real GDP growth in 2022 and 2023 were generally little changed .
" Many participants commented that accommodative financial conditions, the release of pent -up demand, progress on widespread vaccination, the ongoing reduction of social -distancing measures, and fiscal stimulus were important factors supporting spending."
" A number of p articipants noted that business equipment investment was rising at a strong pace, but growth in manufacturing activity was being restrained by production bottlenecks and supply constraints."
" In addition, participants reported hearing from contacts in a broad range of industries that shortages of materials and labor as well as supply chain challenges  were limiting the ability of firms to keep up with demand."
" Some business contacts indicated that they were responding to input shortages and bottlenecks by canceling shifts, raising compensation to attract and retain workers, raising prices, or focusing on cutting costs and increasing productivity, particularly through automation."
" Job gains in April and May averaged more than  400,000 , and the unemployment rate edged down, on net, to 5.8 percent over the period."
" Many  participants remarked, however, that the economy was still far from achieving the Committee’s broad -based and inclusive maximum -employment goal, and some participants  indicated that recent job gains, while strong, were weaker than they had expected."
" Participants noted that their District contacts had reported having trouble hiring workers to meet demand, likely reflecting factors such as early retirements, concerns about the virus, childcare responsibilities, and expanded unemployment insurance benefits."
" P articipants expected labor market conditions to continue to improve, with labor shortages expected to ease throughout the summer and into the fall as progress on vaccinations continue s, social distancing unwinds further, more schools reopen, and expanded unemployment insurance benefits expire."
" In their discussions on inflation, participants stated that they had expected inflation to move above 2 percent in the near term, in part as the drop in price s from early in the pandemic fell out of the calculation and past increases in oil prices passed t hrough to consumer energy prices."
" However, participants remarked that the actual rise in inflation  was larger than anticipated , with the  12month change in the PCE price index reaching 3.6 percent in April."
 Participants attributed the upside surprise to more widespread supply constraints in product and labor markets than they had anticipated and to a largerthan-expected surge in consumer demand as the economy reopened.
 Most participants observ ed that the largest contributors to the rise in  measured inflation were sectors  affected by supply bottlenecks or sectors where price levels  were rebounding  from levels depressed by the pandemic .
" Looking ahead, participants generally expected inflation to ease as the effect of these transitory factors dissipated, but several participants remarked that they anticipated that supply chain limitations  and input shortages would put upward pressure on prices into next  year."
" Several participants  noted that , during the early months of the reopening , uncertainty remained too high to accurately assess how long inflation pressures  will be sustained ."
" Some participants commented that recent readings of inflation measures that exclude volatile components, such as trimmed mean measures, had been relatively stable  at or just below 2 percent ."
" In their comments on longer -term inflation expectations , a number of participants  noted that, despite  increases earlier this year,  measures of longer -term inflation expectations had remained  in ranges that were broadly consistent with the Committee’s lon gerrun inflation goal."
 Others noted that it was this year’s increases that had brought  these measures to levels that were broadly consistent with the Committee’s longer -run inflation goal.
" Participants noted that overall financial conditions remained highly accommodative, in part reflecting the stance of monetary policy, which continued to deliver appropriate support to the economy."
"  Several  participants highlighted, however,  that low interest rates were contributing to elevated house prices and that valuation pressures in housing markets might pose financial stability risks."
"  Although they generally saw the risks to the outlook for economic activity as broadly balanced,  a substantial majority of participants judged that the risks to their inflation projections were til ted to the upside because of concerns that supply disruptions and labor shortages might  linger for longer and might  have larger or more persistent effects on prices and wages than they currently assumed."
 Several participants  expressed concern that longer -term inflation expectations might  rise to inappropriate levels if elevated inflation readings persisted.
 Several  other  participants cautioned that downside risks to inflation rePage 10Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________   mained because temporary price pressures  might  unwind faster than currently anticipated and because the forces that held down inflation and inflation expectations during the previous economic expansion had not gone away  or might  reinforce the effect of the unwinding of temporary price pressures .
"In their consideration of the stance of monetary policy, participants reaffirmed the Federal Reserve’s commitment to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy during this challenging time, thereby promoting the Committee’s statutory goals of maximum employment and price sta bility."
" Although inflation had risen more than anticipated, the increase was seen as largely reflecting temporary factors, and participants expected inflation to decline toward the Committee’s 2 percent longer -run objective."
  Participants judged that the current stance of monetary policy and policy guidance remained appropriate to promote maximum employment as well as to achieve inflation that averages 2  percent over time and longer -term inflation expectations that are well anchored at 2  percent.
 Participants also reiterated that the existing outcome -based guidance implied that the paths of the federal funds rate and the balance sheet would depend on actual progress toward reaching the Committee’s maximum- employment and inflation goals.
" Several  participants emphasized, however, that uncertainty around the economic outlook was elevated and that it was too early to draw firm conclusions about the paths of the labor market and inflation."
 Some participants  noted that communications about the appropriate path of policy would be a focus of market  participants in the current environment and commented that it would be important to  emphasize  that the Committee’s reaction function or commitment to its monetary policy framework had  not changed.
 Some participants  saw the i ncoming data as providing a less clear signal about the underlying economic momentum and  judged that  the Committee would have information in coming months to make a better assessment of  the path of the labor market  and inflation .
"  With regard to the implementation of monetary policy, participants had observed downward pressure on money market rates over the intermeeting period and viewed the possibility of further downward pressure on these rates in the near term as likely."
" Participants agreed that Minutes of the Meeting of June 15–16, 2021Page 11_____________________________________________________________________________________________   this technic al adjustment had no bearing on the appropriate path for the federal funds rate or the stance of monetary policy."
"  Committee Policy Action  In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that progress on vaccinations had reduced the spread of COVID -19 in the United States."
" They noted that amid progress and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment had strengthened."
" Inflation had risen, largely reflecting transitory factors."
"Members agreed that the Federal Reserve was committed to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximumemployment and price -stability goals."
" All members reaffirmed that, in accorda nce with the Committee’s goals to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run and with inflation having run persistently below this longer -run goal, they would aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer -term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent."
 Members expected to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until those outcomes were achieved.
" All membe rs agreed to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent, and they expected that it would be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions had reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessments of ma ximum employment and inflation had risen to 2 percent and was on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time."
" In addition, members agreed that it would be appropriate for the Federal Reserve to continue to increase its holdings of Treasury securiti es by at least $80 billion per month and agency MBS  by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress had been made toward the Committee’s maximumemployment and price -stability goals."
" Members agreed that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would continue to monitor the  implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and that they would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate in the event that risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals."
" Members also concurred that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and  international developments."
" • Engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve’ s agency MBS transactions.”  The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2:00  p.m.: “The Federal Reserve is committed to using its full range of tools to support the U.S.  economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum employment and price stability goals."
" Amid this progress and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened."
" Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors."
 The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2  percent over the longer run.
" With inflation having r un persistently below this longer -run goal, the Committee will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2  percent for some time so that inflation averages 2  percent over time and longer‑term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2  percent."
 The Committee expects to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomes are achieved.
 The Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0  to ¼ percent and expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee’ s assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2  percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2  percent for some time.
" In addition, the Federal Re serve will continue to increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80  billion per month and of agency mortgage‑backed securities by at least $40  billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward the Committee’ s maximum  employment and price stability goals."
" In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook."
 The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee ’s goals.
" The Committee ’s assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments .” Voting for this action:   Jerome H ."
" Minutes of the Meeting of June 15–16, 2021Page 13_____________________________________________________________________________________________   Consistent with the Committee’s decision to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the Board of Governors voted unanimously to raise the interest rates on required and excess reserve balances to 0.15 percent."
 Setting the interest rate paid on required and excess reserve balances 15  basis points above the bottom of the target range for the federal funds rate is intended to foster trading in the federal funds market at rates well within the Federal  Open Market Committee’s target range and to support the smooth functioning of short -term funding markets.
