" Equity price indexes were up substantially from the lows of late March, safe -haven demands for the dollar had receded, and measures of realized and implied volatility across markets had diminished."
" Open Market Desk surveys suggested that market participants anticipated a sharp  nearterm decline in economic activity, followed by some recovery later this year ."
" For example, the minimum bid rate in repo operations could be increased somewhat relative to the level of the interest rate on excess reserves ( the IOER  rate)."
"Later in the intermeeting period, shortterm interest rates drifted lower and settled at near -zero levels."
Staff Review of the Economic Situation  The coronavirus outbreak and the measures taken to protect public health were severely disrupting economic activity in the United States and abroad.
" Consumer price inflation, as measured by the 12 -month percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), remained below 2  percent in February."
" Job losses surged in March, even though the drop in total nonfarm payroll employment reflected only those changes that had occurred through the mid -month reference period of the establishment survey."
" In addition, the unemployment rate jumped to 4.4  percent in March, and the labor force participation rate decr eased notably."
" After economic shutdowns started to occur on a widespread basis, initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits skyrocketed in the second half of March through the first half of April, a development that pointed to substantial job losse s in April."
" Nominal wage growth remained moderate, as average hourly earnings for all employees increased 3.1 percent over the 12 months ending in March."
" Total PCE price inflation and core PCE price inflation, which excludes consumer food and energy price s, both increased 1.8 percent over the 12  months ending in February."
" The trimmed mean measure of 12 -month PCE price inflation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of April 28–29, 2020Page 3 of Dallas was 2.0 percent in February."
 Recent readings on surveybased measures of longer -run inflation expectations were little changed on balance.
" The coronavirus outbreak and the effects on economic activity of measures to contain it, together with the associated elevated level of uncertainty, were likely reflected in recent downbeat readings on business sentiment in national and regional surveys  and appeared to weigh heavily o n business investment."
" However, imports declined at a much faster rate so tha t net exports made a sizable positive contribution to GDP growth."
 Much of the quarterly decline in trade volumes reflected a sharp drop in March  due to  weak demand globally and disruptions related to the coronavirus outbreak.
 Foreign economic activity fell sharply in the first quarter of the year amid widespread mandatory business shutdowns and strict socia ldistancing measures to contain the spread of the coronavirus outbreak.
" Foreign inflation fell steeply, reflecting large drops in energy prices related to plunging oil prices, while core inflation pressures generally remained muted."
" Measures of inflation compensation based on Treasury InflationProtected  Securities  (TIPS)  ended the period higher , on net, but were  still low by  historical standards ."
" Inflation compensation fell sharply in the first half of March but subsequently  recovered, as overall financial conditions and TIPS liquidity improved."
" Strong demand for dollars amid flight to safety globally, together with disruptions in U.S. shortterm funding markets, caused severe strains in funding markets for dollars abroad, especially early in the intermeeting period."
" Despite a considerable widening of the spread between the primary mortgage rate and MBS yields, primary mortgage interest rates were low by historical standards, and available indicators suggested that refinancing activity remained elevated."
" The volume of mortgage rate locks for home -purchase loans dropped materially in early April, reflectin g in part declines in homebuyer demand and disruptions in the home search and purchase process."
" Though banks in the April SLOOS reported tightening standards on new consumer loans, respondents also experienced weaker demand for all consumer loan types."
 Auto loan interest rates dropped sharply in early April as manufacturers introduced attractive financing pro grams to boost sales.
 Banks were able to meet surging demand for draws on cred it lines while also building loan loss reserves to absorb higher expected defaults.
 U.S. real GDP was forecast to plummet and the unemployment rate to soar in the second quarter of this year.
 The substantial fiscal policy measures and monetary policy support that ha d been put in place were expected to help mitigate the deterioration in economic conditions and help boost the recovery.
" Under the staff ’s baseline assumptions that the current restrictions on social interactions and business operations would ease gradually this year, real GDP was forecast to rise appreciably and the unemployment rate to decline considerably in the second half of the year, al though a complete recovery was not expected by year -end."
" Inflation was projected to weaken this year, reflecting both the deterioration in resource utilization and sizable expected declines in consumer energy prices."
" Under the baseline assumptions, economic conditions were projected to continue to improve, and inflation to pick back up, over the next two years."
" In this scenario, a second wave of the coronavirus outbreak, with another round of strict restrictions on social interactions and business operations, was assumed to begin around year -end, inducing a decrease in real GDP, a jump in the unemploy ment rate, and renewed downward pressure on inflation next year."
" Compared with the baseline, the disruption to economic activity was more severe and protracted in this scenario, _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of April 28–29, 2020Page 7 with real GDP and inflation lower and the unemployment rate higher by the end  of the mediumterm projection."
 The virus and the measures taken to protect public health were inducing sharp declines in economic activity and a surge in job losses.
 Weaker demand and significantly lower oil prices were holding down consumer price inflation.
" Participants judged that t he effects of the coronavirus outbreak and the ongoing public health crisis would continue to  weigh heavily on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term and would pose considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term."
 Participants assessed that the second quarter would likely see overall economic activity declin e at an unprecedented rate.
" In addition, economic activity was being supported by actions taken by the Federal Reserve, including lending facilities created under the authority of section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act, some of which included capital allocated by the U.S. Treasury."
" Regarding the economic activity of households, participants noted that the pandemic and efforts to mitigate the spread of the disease were having severely adverse effects on aggregate household spending and consumer confidence."
" Participants were further concerned that even after social -distancing requirements were eased, some business models may no longer be economically viable , which  could occur, for example, if consumers voluntarily continued to avoid participating in particular forms of economic activity."
" A sharp reduction Page 8Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ in global demand for petroleum had led to unused supply that was overwhelming storage capacity, resulting in a plunge in oil prices."
" With regard to the labor  market, participants noted that incoming data confirmed that an extreme decline in employment was under  way."
" Nationally, initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits had totaled more than 25 million from mid -March to the time of the meeting , and participants expected that the unemployment rate would soon reach the highest levels of the post–World War II  period ."
" Participants were concerned that temporary layoffs could become permanent, and that workers who lose employment could face a loss of job -specific skills or may become discouraged and exit the labor force."
" With regard to inflation, participants noted that it had been running below the Committee ’s 2 percent longer -run objective  before the coronavirus outbreak."
" While the pandemic had created some supply constraints, which had generated upward pressure on the prices of some goods, the pandemic had also reduced demand, which had exerted downward pres sure on prices."
 The overall effect of the outbreak on prices was seen as disinflationary .
" In addition, a stronger dollar and lower oil prices were factors likely to put downward pressure on inflation, and market -based measures of inflation compensation remained very low."
 Participants observed that the return of inflation to the Committee ’s 2 percent longer -run objective would likely be further delayed but that the accommodative stance of monetary policy would be helpful in achieving the 2 percent inflation objective over the longer run.
" For example, the PPP was providing a financial lifeline to small businesses, the expansion of unemployment benefits was helping restore lost income for laidoff workers, and the Treasury had p rovided a necessary financial backstop to many Federal Reserve lending facilities."
" Participants commented that, in addition to weighing heavily on economic activity in the near term, the economic effects of the pandemic created an extraordinary amount of uncertainty and considerable risks to economic activity in the medium term."
 Participants discussed several alternative scenarios with regard to the behavior of economic activity in the medium term that all seemed about equally likely.
" In such scenarios, it was believed likely that there would be further economic disruptions, including additional periods of mandatory social distancing, greater supp ly chain dislocations, and a substantial  number  of business closures and loss of income; in total, such developments could lead to a protracted period of severely reduced economic activity."
" On the other hand, economic activity could recover more quickly if the pandemic subsided enough for  households and businesses to become  sufficiently confident to relax or modify social-distancing behaviors over the next several months."
" Beyond these considerations , participants noted the risk that foreign  economies, particularly EMEs, could come under extreme pressure as a result of the pandemic and that this strain could spill over to and hamper U.S. economic activity."
" One of these risks was that workers who lose employment as a result of the pandemic may experience a loss  of skills , lose access to adequate childcare or eldercare,  _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of April 28–29, 2020Page 9 or become discouraged and exit the labor force."
" The longer -term behavior of firms could be affected as well—for instance , if necessary but costly transmission -mitigation strategies lowered firms ’ productivity; if business investment shifted down permanently ; if many firms need to adjust their business models in the aftermath of the pandemic; or if business closures , particularly those of small firms , became widespread."
" A few participants noted that higher levels of government indebtedness, which would be exacerbated by fiscal expenditures that were necessary to combat the economic effects of the pandemic, could put downward pressure on growth in aggregate potential output."
" Participants were concerned  that banks could come under greater stress, particularly if adverse  scenarios for the spread of the pandemic and economic activity were realized, and  so this sector should be monitored carefully."
" In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, participants noted that the Federal Reserve was committed to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum employment and price stability g oals."
" In light of their assessment that the ongoing public health crisis would weigh heavily on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term and posed  considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term, all participants judge d that it would be appropriate to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent."
" Keeping the target range at the effective lower bound, after quickly reducing it by 150 basis points in March , would continue to provide support to t he economy and promote the Committee ’s maximum employment and price stability goals."
 Participants also judged that it would be appropriate to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at its present level until policymakers were confident that the economy had weathered recent events and was on track to achieve the Committee ’s maximum employment and price stability goals.
 These open market purchases would continue to support the flow of credit to households and businesses and thereby foster the effective t ransmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions.
" Page 10Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ While participants agreed that the current stance of monetary policy remained appropriate, they noted that the Committee could, at upcoming meetings, further clarify its intentions with respect to its fut ure monetary policy decisions."
" For example , the Committee could adopt outcome -based forward guidance that would specify macroeconomic outcomes —such as a certain level of the unemployment rate or of the inflation rate —that must be achieved before the Committee would consider raising the target range for the federal funds rate."
 These participants noted that such explicit forms  of forward guidance could help ensure that the public ’s expectations regarding the future conduct of monetary policy continued to reflec t the Committee ’s intentions.
" Several participants observed that the  completion, most likely later this year,  of the monetary policy framework review, together with  the announcement of  the conclusions arising from the review , would help further  clarify t he Committee’s intentions with respect to its future monetary policy actions."
