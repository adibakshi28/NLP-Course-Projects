 4 Chiara Scotti’s selection was set to be effective upon her employment with the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.
" The Committee voted unanimously to reaffirm all four policies without revision .3  As part of  the Committee’s annual organizational review process, all participants indicated support  for the Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, and the Committee voted unanimously to reaffirm it without revision.3   Developments in Financial Markets and Open Market Operations  The manager pro tem turned first to a review of U.S. financial market developments."
" Market participants generally expected U.S. economic growth to moderate this year, although there was a wide dispersion in views about the extent of a potential slowdown."
 Market participants interpreted incoming data as pointing to moderating inflation risks.
  Moderating inflation in the United States and improving global growth prospects lifted market sentiment.
" While most Desk survey respondents expected subdued growth or a mild recession  in 2023, market participants continued to see notable uncertainties ahead, including prospects for a deeper downturn or the potential for more persistent inflation."
"  Regarding the international outlook, signs of a faster reopening in China and a less severe downturn in Eur ope eased  concerns about global growth, contributing to a depreciation in the exchange value of the dollar and supporting optimism about emerging market economies ."
" Narrowing interest rate differentials between the U nited States and other advanced foreign economies also contributed to dollar depreciation, as some foreign central bank communications suggested a need for further monetary policy tightening to address inflation pressures."
" Should transitory pressures occur in money markets over the course of the year, the manager pro tem noted that the standing Page 4Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________repurchase agreement (repo) facility and discount window would be available to help support effective monetary policy implementation."
" Staff Review of the Economic Situation  The information available at the time of the January 31 –February 1 meeting indicated that labor market conditions remained tight in December, with the unemployment rate at a historical low."
 Consumer price inflation—as measured by the 12 -month percent  change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE)—continued to step down in November and December but was still elevated.
"   Total nonfarm payroll employment increased solidly in December , although  at a slower pace than in the previous two months."
 The unemployment rate moved back down to 3.5  percent  in December.
" The unemployment rate for African Americans was unchanged, and the unemployment rate for Hispanics ticked up; the unemployment rates for both groups remained above the aggregate measure."
 The aggregate measures of both the labor force participation rate and the employment -topopula-tion ratio edged up.
  Measures of nominal wage growth slowed at the end of last year but continued to be elevated.
" The threemonth change in the employment cost index (ECI) of hourly compensation in the private sector slowed to a 4.0  percent annual rate in December, while the three -month change measure of average hourly earnings (AHE) for all employees eased to an annual rate of 4.1  percent."
  Consumer price inflation eased in November and December but remained elevated.
" Total PCE price inflation was 5.0  percent over the 12 months ending in December, 1.1 percent age points lower than the October figure."
" Core PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in consumer energy prices and many consumer food prices, was 4.4  percent  over the 12 months ending in December, down 0.7  percent age point from its October reading."
" The trimmed mean measure of 12 -month PCE price inflation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas was 4.4  percent  in December, 0.3  percentage point lower than in October."
" The latest surveybased readings on longer -term inflation expectations from the Univ ersity of Michigan Surveys of Consumers and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Survey of Consumer Expectations remained within the range of their values reported in recent months, while near -term measures of inflation expectations from these surveys moved down along with actual inflation."
" Real GDP growth was bolstered especially by a large gain in inventory investment and a notable contribution from net exports, as imports fell more than exports ."
" Foreign economic growth slowed in the fourth quarter, weighed down by the COVID19-related slowdown in China and repercussions of Russia’s war against Ukraine."
" Weaker global demand and a rebalancing from goods to services also resulted in a pronounced slowdown in manufacturing, which weighed on activity in emerging Asia."
" In Europe, the slowdown in economic growth was tempered by mild winter weather, which also prompted further declines in energy _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of January 31–February 1, 2023Page 5prices."
 A decline in retail energy as well as food prices contributed to an easing in headline consumer price inflation in many foreign economies.
" With core inflation remaining elevated amid tight labor markets, however, many central banks continued to tighten monetary policy."
" Nominal Treasury yields were little changed, while swaps -based inflation compensation measures fell notably."
" On net, nominal Treasury yields were roughly unchanged , and swaps -marketimplied inflation compensation measures fell notably."
 Bank interest rates for commercial and industrial (C&I) loans continued to trend upward in the fourth quarter.
" Interest rates on existing credit cards continued to increase in recent months, and interest rates on new auto loans also rose through mid -January."
" New launches of leveraged loans were notably subdued in December and Janua ry, likely reflecting soft investor demand and higher reference rates on floating -rate loans."
" Although C&I loans at banks continued to expand through December, they decelerated relative to earlier in the year, in line with tighter lending standards and weaker demand for C&I loans over the fourth quarter."
  CRE loan growth on domestic banks’ balance sheets remained robust in the fourth quarter.
" Meanwhile, issuance of commercial mortgagebacked securities  remained slow in November and December, amid high base interest rates and spreads."
"The staff assessed that vulnerabilities associated with household and business leverage remained moderate, noting that althou gh measures of business leverage were at or near a historically high level, the ability of firms to service their debt has kept pace with rising debt loads and interest rates."
" Staff Economic Outlook  The forecast for the U.S. economy prepared by the staff for this FOMC meeting had a somewhat higher path for the level of real GDP and a modestly lower path for the unemployment rate than in the December projection, reflecting both the recent data and a small additional boost to output from a lower projected path for the dollar."
" Although recent data indicated that real GDP growth in the fourth quarter of 2022 was stronger than expected, real PDFP growth  was weaker than previously forecast, and the large, unexpected boost to GDP growth from inventory investment was not projected to persist."
" In part reflecting the lagged effects of previous monetary policy tightening, the staff still projected real GDP growth to slow markedly this year and the labor market to soften."
" The staff forecast continued to include a pickup in real GDP growth starting next year, although  projected  output growth in 2024 and 2025 remains below the staff’s estimate of potential output growth."
" Likewise, the unemployment rate was projected to gradually move up to the staff’s estimate of its natural rate at the end of 2025."
" On a four -quarter change basis, total PCE price inflation was forecast to be 2.8  percent  in 2023, and core inflation was expected to be 3.2  percent, both lower than in the December projection."
" With the effects of supply– demand imbalances in goods markets expected to further unwind and labor and product markets projected to become less tight, the staff continued to forecast that inflation would decline further over 2024 and 2025."
" On a fourquarter change basis, core goods inflation was projected to move down further this year and then remain subdued, housing services inflation was expected to peak later this year and then move down, and  core nonhousing services inflation was forecast to slow as nominal wage growth eased."
" With steep declines in consumer energy prices and a substantial moderation in food price inflation expected for this year, total inflation was projected t o step down markedly this year and then to track core inflation over the following two years."
" In 2025, both total and core PCE price inflation were expected to be near 2  percent ."
"The sluggish growth in real private domestic spending expected this year and  the persistently tight financial conditions were seen as tilting the risks to the downside around the baseline projection for real economic activity, and the staff still viewed the possibility of a recession sometime this year as a plausible alternative to the baseline."
" Moreover, with core PCE price inflation having slowed in recent months, along with the cumulative upward revisions to the core inflation projection over the past year and the expected softening in economic growth, the staff now viewed the risks around the baseline forecast for inflation this year as balanced."
" For beyond this year, the staff continued to view the risks around the inflation projection as skewed to the upside, reflecting concerns about the potential persistence of inflation."
" Participants ’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook  In their discussion of current economic conditions, participants noted that recent indicators pointed to modest growth in spending and production."
" Nonetheless, job gains had been robust in recent months, and the unemployment rate remained low."
 Inflation had eased somewhat but remained elevated.
" Against this background, participants continued to be highly attentive to inflation risks."
" Participants agreed that cumulative policy firming to date had reduced demand in the most interestrate-sensitive sectors of the economy, particularly housing."
 Participants observed that growth in economic activity in 2022 had been below its long errun trend and expected that real GDP growth would slow further in 2023.
" While real GDP growth had rebounded in the second half of 2022, several participants noted that growth in PDFP  had nearly stalled in the fourth quarter."
" With inflation remaining unacceptably high, participants expected that a period of below -trend growth in real GDP would be needed to bring aggregate demand  into better balance with aggregate supply and thereby reduce inflationary pressures."
" Some participants judged that recent economic data signaled a somewhat higher chance of continued subdued economic growth, with inflation fall ing over time to the Committee’s longer -run go al of 2  percent, although  some participants noted that the probability of the economy entering a recession in 2023 remained elevated."
" Participants noted that excess savings accumulated during the pandemic had continued to support consumption, although several participants remarked that the importance of this factor would likely wane over time as excess savings continued to be drawn down or eroded by inflation."
" A few participants noted the effects of higher interest costs in restraining consumption or inhibiting the ability of some households to repay their loans, while a couple of participants noted that inflation was eroding households’ purchasing power ."
"Regarding the business sector, participants observed that growth in business fixed investment spending had been subdued in the fourth quarter  and was being restrained by past interest rate increases."
 Several participants remarked that the recent strong growth in inventory investment will likely slow; a couple of those participants noted  that businesses appeared more confident that significant supply bottlenecks would not reemerge and might therefore choose to hold smaller inventories.
 Some participants commented that the easing of COVID -related lockdown restrictions in China or stronger -thanexpected growth in economic activity in the e uro area could  provide support to final demand  in the U nited States.
Participants agreed that the labor market remained very tight and assessed that labor demand substantially exceeded the supply of available workers.
" Participants noted that the unemployment rate had returned to a historically low level in December, job va cancies remained high, and wage growth remained elevated."
 Several participants noted  that recent reductions in the workforces of some large technology businesses followed much larger increases  over the previous few years  and judged that these reductions d id not appear to reflect widespread weakness in the demand for labor.
 A few participants remarked that some business contacts  appeared keen to retain workers even in the face of slowing demand for output because of their recent experiences of labor shortages and hiring challenges.
" Nevertheless, participants noted tentative signs that imbalances between demand and supply in the labor market were improving, with job vacancies and payroll gains declining somewhat from high levels, the average number of hours worked falling, and growth in wages and employment costs slowing."
" Some participants commented on the recent reduction in temporary employment, which previously had often preceded more widespread reductions in labor demand."
" Under appropriate monetary policy, participants expected labor market demand  and supply to come into better balance over time, easing upward pressure on nominal wages and prices."
" A number of participants commented on the importance of recognizing  that, to the extent national unemployment increases , historical evidence indicates that even larger increases in the unemployment rate for some demographic groups —particularly African Americans and Hi spanics—would be likely  to occur ."
"With inflation still well above the Committee’s longer -run goal of 2  percent , participants agreed that inflation was unacceptably high."
 A number of participants commented that the costs of elevated inflation are particularly high for lower -income households.
 Participants noted that inflation data received over the past three months showed a welcome reduction in the monthly pace of price increases but stressed that substantially more evidence of progress across a broader range of prices would be required to be confident that inflation was on a sustained downward path.
" Participants judged that housing services inflation would likely begin to fall later this year, reflecting continued smaller i ncreases , or potentially declines , in rents on new leases."
" Participants  judged that as long as the labor market remained very _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of January 31–February 1, 2023Page 9tight, wage growth in excess of 2 percent inflation and trend productivity growth  would likely continue to put upward pressure on some prices in this component."
" A couple of participants observed  that changes in wages tend to lag changes in prices, which can complicate the assessment of inflation pressures."
" A couple of participants remarked that the poor performance of labor productivity growth last year was  restraining aggregate supply, which was contributing to imbalances between aggregate demand  and aggregate supply and therefore to upward pressure on inflation."
" Several participants noted the possibility  that as consumers become more price sensitive , businesses might  accept lower profit margins  in an effort to maintain market share, which could reduce inflation temporarily."
 Participants observed that indicators of shortterm inflation expectations from surveys of households and businesses as well as from financial markets had come down and that long erterm inflation expectations remained well anchored.
" A number of participants noted the importance of longer -term inflation expectations remaining anchored and remarked that the longer inflation remained elevated, the greater the risk of inflation expectations becoming unanchored."
" In that adverse scenario, it would be more costly to bring inflation down to achieve the Committee’s statutory objectives of maximum emplo yment and price stability."
 A few participants noted that increased confidence among  market participants that inflation would fall quickly appeared to contribute to declines in market expectations of the federal funds rate path beyond the near term.
 Participants noted  that it was important that overall financial conditions be consistent with the degree of policy restraint that the Committee is putting into place in order to bring inflation back to the 2  percent  goal.
"  Participants observed  that the uncertainty associated with their outlooks for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation was high."
" Regarding upside risks to inflation, participants cited a variety of factors, including the possibility that price pressures could prove to be more persistent than anticipated due to, for example, the labor market staying tight for longer than anticipated."
" Participants also saw a number of upside risks surrounding the outlook for inflation stemming from factors abroad, such as China’s relaxation of its zero -COVID policies and Russia ’s continuing war against Ukraine."
" However, a few participants remarked that the risks to their inflation outlook had become more balanced."
 Participants agreed that the risks to the outlook for economic activity were weighted to the downside.
" Participants noted that sources of such risks included the prospect of unexpected negative shocks tipping the economy into a recession in an environment of subdued growth, the effects of synchronous policy firming by major central banks, and disruptions in the financial system and broader economy associated with concerns that the statutory debt limit might not be raised in a timely manner."
"  In their discussion of issues related to financial stability, several participants discussed vulnerabilities in the financial system associated with higher  interest rates, including the elevated valuations for some categories of assets , particularly in the CRE secto r; the susceptibility of some nonbank financial institutions to runs ; and the effect of large, unrealized losses on some banks’ securities portfolios."
" In their consideration of appropriate monetary policy actions at this meeting, participants concurred that the Committee had made significant progress over the past year in moving toward a sufficiently restrictive stance of monetary policy."
" Even so, participants agreed that , Page 10Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________while there were recen t signs that the cumulative effect of the Committee’s tightening of the stance of monetary policy had begun to moderate inflationary pressures, inflation remained well above the Committee’s longer -run goal of 2  percent and the labor market remained very tight, contributing to continuing upward pressures on wages and prices."
" Against this backdrop, and in consideration of the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation,  almost all participants  agreed that it was appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate 25 basis points at this meeting ."
 Many of t hese participants observed that a further slowing in the pace of rate increases would better allow them to assess the economy’ s progress toward the Committee’s goals of maximum employment and price stability as the y determine the extent of future policy tightening that will be required to attain a stance that is sufficiently restrictive to achieve these goals.
" In discussing the policy outlook, with inflation still well above the Committee’s 2 percent  goal and the labor market remaining very tight, all participants continued to anticipate that ongoing increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would be appropriate to achieve the Committee’s objectives."
 Participants affirmed their strong commitment to returning inflation to the Committee’s 2 percent  objective.
" In determining the extent of future increases in the target range, participants judged that it would be appropriate to take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments."
" Participants observed that a restrictive policy stance would need to be maintained until the incoming data provided confidence that inflation was on a sustained downward path to 2  percent , which was likely to take some time."
 Participants discussed the heightened uncertainty regarding the economic outlook and a number of factors that could affect inflation and real economic activity.
 Participants generally noted that the Committee’s future decisions regarding policy would continue to be informed by the incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation.
" A number of participants observed that financial conditions had eased in recent months, which some noted could necessitate a tighter stance of monetary policy."
   Participants also discussed a number of riskmanage-ment considerations related to the conduct of monetary policy.
" With inflation still well above the Committee’s longer -run goal, p articipants generally noted  that upside risks to the inflation outlook remained a key factor shaping the policy  outlook , and that maintaining a restrictive policy stance until inflation is clearly on a path toward 2  percent  is appropriate from a risk -management perspective."
" A number of particip ants observed that a policy stance that proved to be insufficiently restrictive could halt recent progress in moderating inflationary pressures, leading inflation to remain above the Committee’s 2 percent  objective for a longer period, and pose a risk of inflation expectations  becoming unanchored ."
" Committee Policy Actions  In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that recent indicators pointed to modest growth in spending and production."
" Members also concurred that job gains had been robust in recent months, and the unemployment rate had remai ned low."
 Members agreed that inflation had eased somewhat but remained elevated.

" _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of January 31–February 1, 2023Page 11Members agreed that the Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2  percent over the longer run."
 Members anticipated that ongoing increases in the target range would be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2  percent over time.
" Members concurred that , in determining the extent of future increases in the target range, they would take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments."
