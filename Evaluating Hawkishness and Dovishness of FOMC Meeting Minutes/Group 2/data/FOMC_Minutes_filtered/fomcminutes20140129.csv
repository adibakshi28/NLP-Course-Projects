" Any such adjustment as described in clause (i) shall be made in the context of the Committee’s discussion and decision at its most recent meeting and the Committee’s longrun objectives to foster maximum employment and price stability, and shall be based on economic, financial, and monetary developments during the intermeeting period."
"For this purpose, the overall open position in all foreign currencies is defined as the sum (disregarding signs) of net positions in individual currencies, excluding Page 4Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________changes in dollar value due to foreign exchange rate movements and interest accruals."
" For the purpose of providing an investment return on System holdings of foreign currencies or for the purpose of adjusting interest rates paid or received in connection with swap drawings, transactions with foreign central banks may be undertaken at nonmarket exchange rates."
"System operations in foreign currencies shall generally be directed at countering disorderly market conditions, provided that market exchange rates for the U.S. dollar reflect actions and behavior consistent with IMF Article IV, Section 1."
" In its annual reconsideration of the Statement on LongerRun Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, participants generally agreed that only minor updates were required at this meeting."
" For example, some participants advocated an explicit indication that inflation persistently below the Committee’s 2 percent longerrun objective and inflation persistently above that objective would be equally undesirable."
  Some others suggested that the statement could more clearly describe how the mandated goals of maximum employment and price stability are linked with the objective of financial stability.
" Following the discussion, the Committee voted to approve minor wording changes to the statement and to update the statement’s reference to participants’ estimates of the longerrun normal unemployment rate."
"      Minutes of the Meeting of January 28–29, 2014Page 7_____________________________________________________________________________________________STATEMENT ON LONGERRUN GOALS AND MONETARY POLICY STRATEGY (As amended effective January 28, 2014)  “The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is firmly committed to fulfilling its statutory mandate from the Congress of promoting maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate longterm interest rates."
 The Committee seeks to explain its monetary policy decisions to the public as clearly as possible.
" Such clarity facilitates wellinformed decisionmaking by households and businesses, reduces economic and financial uncertainty, increase s the effectiveness of monetary policy, and enhances transparency and accountability, which are essential in a democratic society."
" Inflation, employment, and longterm interest rates fluctuate over time in response to economic and financial disturbances."
" Moreover, monetary policy actions tend to influence economic activity and prices with a lag."
" The inflation rate over the longer run is primarily determined by monetary policy, and hence the Committee has the ability to specify a longerrun goal for inflation."
" The Committee reaffirms its judgment that inflation at the rate of 2 percent, as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, is most consistent over the longer run with the Federal Reserve’s statutory mandate."
" Communicating this inflation goal clearly to the public helps keep longer-term inflation expectations firmly anchored, thereby fostering price stability and moderate longterm interest rates and enhancing the Commi ttee’s ability to promote maximum employment in the face of significant economic disturbances."
 The maximum level of employment is largely determined by nonmonetary factors that affect the structure and dynamics of the labor market.
" Consequently, it would not be appropriate to specify a fixed goal for employment; rather, the Committee’s policy decisions must be in formed by assessments of the maximum level of employment, recognizing that such assessments are necessa rily uncertain and subject to revision."
 Information about Committee participants’ estimates of the longerrun normal rates of output growth and unemployment is published four times per year in the FOMC’s Summary of Economic Projections.
" For example, in the most recent projections, FOMC participants’ estimates of the longerrun normal rate of unemployment had a central tendency of 5.2 percent to 5.8 percent."
" In setting monetary policy, the Committee seeks to mitigate deviations of inflation from its longerrun goal and deviations of employment from the Committee’s assessments of its maximum level."
" However, under circumstances in which the Committee judges that the objectives are not complementary, it follows a balanced approach in promoting them, taking into account the magnitude of the deviations and the potentially different time horizons over which employment and inflation are projected to return to levels judged consistent with its mandate."
" Under the terms of the proposal, the interest rate on ON RRPs would remain between 0 and 5 basis points."
 The proposed changes were intended to allow the Committee to obtain additional information about the potential usefulness of ON RRP operations for affecting market interest rates when that step becomes appropriate.
 It was remarked that the additional insights obtained from the exercise could be useful in the context of the Committee’s future discussions about monetary policy implementation over the medium and longer term.
Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information reviewed for the January 28–29 meeting indicated that the rate of economic growth picked up in the second half of 2013.
" Total payroll employment increased in December, but at a slower pace than in previous months, and the unemployment rate declined but was still elevated."
" Consumer price inflation continued to run below the Committee’s longerrun objective, while measures of longerterm inflation expectations remained stable."
" Total nonfarm payroll employment expanded by less in December than in the previous two months, perhaps partly be cause of unusually bad weather."
 The unemployment rate declined to 6.7 percent in December.
" The labor force participation rate also decreased, and the employmentto-population ratio was little changed."
" The rate of longduration unemployment declined, but the share of workers employed part time for economic reasons was little changed, and both measures remained elevated."
" Initial claims for unemployment insurance moved down, on balance, over the intermeeting period, and household expectations of the labor market situation improved, on net, in December and early January."
" Households’ real disposable income was little changed in October and November, and the expiration of the emergency unemployment compensation program at the end of 2013 was expected to reduce aggregate income growth early this year."
"    The U.S. international trade deficit narrowed substantially in November, as ex ports increased and imports fell."
"Total U.S. consumer price inflation, as measured by the PCE price index, was a little under 1 percent over the 12 months ending in Nove mber, well below the Committee’s 2 percent longerterm objective."
" In December, the consumer price index (CPI) rose somewhat faster than in recent months, primarily reflecting an upturn in consumer energy prices; core CPI inflation remained low."
" Both nearterm and longerterm inflation expectations from the Michigan survey were little changed, on net, in December and early January."
" Over the 12 months ending in December, nominal average hourly earnings for all employees incr eased slightly faster than consumer price inflation."
"Foreign economic activity continued to improve, with economic growth in the th ird quarter of 2013 higher than in the first half of the year and more recent indicators suggesting further gain s."
" The pickup was widespread, as the euro area registered a second consecutive Page 10Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________quarter of positive economic growth, the Mexican economy bounced back from a secondquarter contraction, and stronger external demand boosted growth in emerging market economies more generally."
" At the same time, inflation continued to run below central bank targets in several advanced economies, and monetary policy remained expansionary in these economies."
" Inflation in emerging market economies remained moderate on average, although Brazil, India, and Turkey again tightened monetary policy during the intermeeting period in response to concerns about inflation and currency depreciation."
" On net, financial conditions in the United States remained supportive of growth in economic activity and employment:  Equity prices increased a bit, longerterm interest rates declined, and the dollar appreciated against most other currencies."
" However, those effects were reversed late in the period when investors appeared to pull back from riskier assets in reaction to rising concern about developments in some emerging market economies and their possible implications for global economic growth."
" The December policy action and subsequent muted market reacti on led to decreased uncertainty about future longerterm interest rates, perhaps contributing to the decline in longerterm rates."
" The measure of 5year inflation compensation based on Treasury inflationprotected securities increased a little, while inflation compensation 5 to 10 years ahead decreased somewhat."
"Reflecting the improved outlook for economic activity and despite mixed fo urthquarter earnings results, the stock prices of bank holding companies rose notably and spreads on credit default swaps for the largest bank holding companies narrowed somewhat."
" According to the January Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices, domestic banks continued to ease their lending standard s and some loan terms on balance; they also experien ced an increase in demand, on net, in most major loan categories in the fourth quarter."
" In the market for commercial mortgagebacked securities, investor demand remained strong and spreads continued to be tight despite high issuance near yearend."
  Financial market conditions in the advanced foreign economies over the intermeeting period generally became more supportive of growth.
" Localcurrency yields rose in some emerging market economies, such as Brazil, South Africa, and Turkey, and shortterm interbank rates in China were volatile and trended higher over the period."
" Staff Economic Outlook  In the economic projection prepared by the staff for the January FOMC meeting, growth of real gross domestic product (GDP) in the second half of 2013 was estimated to have been stronger than the staff had expected, though some of the strength in inventory investment and net exports wa s possibly transitory."
" The staff’s mediumterm forecast for real GDP growth was little revised, on balance, as the momentum implied by faster GDP growth in the second half of 2013 was largely offset by a higher projected path for the foreign exchange value of the dollar."
" This acceleration in economic activity was expected to be supported by stillaccommodative monetary policy and an easing in the effects of fiscal policy restraint on economic growth, as well as by increases in consumer and business confidence, further improvements in credit availability and financial conditio ns, and continued gains in foreign economic growth."
" The expansion in economic activity was anticipated to lead to a slow reduction in resource slack over the projection period, and the unemployment rate was expect ed to decline gradually, reaching the staff’s estimate of its longerrun natural rate in 2016."
"  The staff’s forecast for inflation was little changed from the projection prepared for the previous FOMC meeting, although the nearterm forecast was revised down a little to reflect recent declines in energy prices."
 The staff continued to forecast that inflation would run well below the Committee’s 2 percent objective early this year but above the low level observed over much of 2013.
" Over the medium term, with longerrun inflation expectations assumed to re main stable, changes in commodity and import prices  expected to be muted, and slack in labor and product markets receding gradually, inflation was projected to move back slowly toward the Committee’s objective."
" The downside risks to the forecast for real GDP growth were thought to have diminished, but the risks were still seen as tilted a little to the downside because, with the target federal funds rate at its effective lower bound, the economy was not well positioned to withstand future adverse shocks."
" At the same time, the staff viewed the risks around its outlook for the unemployment rate and for inflation as roughly balanced."
"Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook  In their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, participants gene rally noted that economic activity had strengthened more in the second half of 2013 than they had expected at the time of the December meeting."
" Although the government shutdown likely damped economic growth somewhat, the extent of restraint on growth from fiscal policy diminished late in the year."
" As a result, participants generally did not expect the recent pace of economic growth to be sustained, bu t they nonetheless anticipated that the economy would expand at a moderate pace in coming quarters."
" That expansion was expected to be supported by highly accommodative monetary policy, a further easing of fiscal restraint, and a modest additional pickup in global economic growth, as well as continued improvement in credit conditions and the ongoing strengthening in household balance sheets."
 A number of participants noted that recent economic news had reinforced their confidence in their projection of moderate economic growth over the medium run.
"Consumer spending had advanc ed strongly in late 2013, contributing importantly to the pickup in growth of economic activity."
" Moreover, various factors were seen as likely to support stronger growth in the sector going forward, including favorable housing affordability, which was in turn partly due to stilllow mortgage rates, and demographic trends."
" A number of factors were cited as likely to support such an increase, including the high level of profits, the low level of interest rates, a re duction in policy uncertainty, the easing of lending standards, and large holdings of liquid assets by corporations."
" However, one participant expressed concern that longerterm interest rates could rise sharply if market participants’ expectations of future monetary policy came to deviate from those of policymakers, as appeared to have happened last summer, while a couple of others argued that the current highly accommodative stance of monetary policy could lead in vestors to take on excessive risk and so undermine longerterm financial stability."
"In their discussion of recent labor market developments, many participants commented on the relatively small increase in payrolls in December and the further decline in the unemployment rate."
" Participants continued to debate the reliability of the unemployment rate as an indicator of overall labor market conditions, taking into account the further decline in  labor force participation in recent quarters, stillelevated levels of underemployment and longterm unemployment, and the apparent absence of wage pressures."
" In addition, several others pointed out that broader concepts of the unemployment rate, such as those that include nonparticipants who report that they want a job and those working part time who want fulltime work, remained well above the official unemployment rate, suggesting that considerable labor market slack remained despite the reduction in the unemployment rate."
  Inflation remained below the Committee’s longerrun objective over the intermeeting period.
" Participants still anticipated that, with l ongerrun inflation expectations stable, transitory factors that had been damping inflation likely to recede, and economic activity picking up, inflation would move back toward the Committee’s 2 percent objective over the medium run."
" However, several factors that cast doubt on this outcome were also mentioned, including slow growth in labor costs, the lack of pricing power reported by business contacts in various parts of the country, the low level of inflation in other advanced economies, and the danger that inflation expectations at short and medium horizons might not be as well anchored as longerrun inflation expectations."
 Participants noted that inflation persistently below the Committee’s objective would pose risks to economic performance and that inflation developments would need to be monitored carefully.
"In their discussion of the path for monetary policy, most participants judged that the incoming information about the economy was broadly in line with their expectations and that a further modest step down in the pace of purchases was appropriate."
" A couple of participants observed that continued low readings on inflation and considerable slack in the labor market raised questions about the desirability of reducing the pace of purchases; these participants judged, however, that a pause in the reduction of purchases was not justified at this stage, especially in lig ht of the strength of the economy in the second half  of 2013."
"  Participants agreed that, with the unemployment rate approaching 6½ percent, it would soon be appropriate for the Committee to change its forward guidance in order to provide informatio n about its decisions regarding the federal funds rate after that threshold was crossed."
" Several participants suggested that risks to financial stability should appear more explicitly in the list of factors that would guide decisions about the federal funds rate once the unemployment rate threshold is crossed, and several participants argued that the forward guidance should give greater emphasis to the Committee’s willingness to keep rates low if inflation we re to remain persistently below the Committee’s 2 percent longerrun objective."
" One participant cited evidence that the equilibrium real interest rate had mo ved higher, and a couple of them noted that some standard policy rules tended to suggest that the federal funds rate should be raised above its effective lower bound before the middle of this year."
Committee Policy Action Committee members saw the information received over the intermeeting period as indicating that growth in economic activity had picked up in recent quarters.
 The unemployment rate had declined but remained elevated when judged against members’ estimates of the longerrun normal rate of unemployment.
" Fiscal policy was restraining economic growth, although the extent of the restraint had diminished."
" The Committee expected that, with appropriate policy accommodation, the economy would expand at a moderate pace and the unemployment rate would gradually decline toward levels consistent with the dual mandate."
" Inflation was running below the Committee’s longerrun objective, and this was seen as posing possible risks to economic performance, but members anticipated that stable inflation expectations and strengthening economic activity would, over time, return inflation to the Committee’s 2 percent objective."
" However, in light of their concerns about the persistence of low inflation, many members saw a need for the Committee to monitor inflation developments carefully for evidence that inflation was moving back toward its longerrun objective."
"In their discussion of monetary policy in the period ahead, all members agreed that the cumulative improvement in labor market conditions and the likelihood of continuing improvement indicated that it would be appropriate to make a further measured reduction in the pace of its asset purchases at this meeting."
 Members also underscored that the pace of asset purchases was not on a preset course and would remain contingent on the Committee’s outlook for the labor market and inflation as well as its assessment of  the efficacy and costs of purchases.
" While making a further measured reduction in its pace of purchases, the Committee emphasized that its holdings of longerterm securities were sizable and would still be increasing, which would promote a stronger economic recovery by maintaining downward pressure on longer -term interest rates, supporting mortgage markets, and helping to make broader financial conditions more accommodative."
" In addition, the Committee decided to repeat the qualitative guidance, introduced in December, clarifying that a range of labor market indicators would be used when assessing the appropriate stance of policy once the unemployment rate threshold had been crossed."
" Members also agreed to reiterate language indicating the Committee’s anticipation, based on its current assessment of additional measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments, that it would be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate well past the time that the unemployment rate declines below 6½ percent, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee’s longerrun objective."
"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct  the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: “Consistent with its st atutory mandate, the Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster maximum employment and price stability."
 The System Open Market Account Manager and the Secretary will keep the Co mmittee informed of ongoing developments regarding the System’s balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the Committee’s objectives of maximum employment and price stability.” The vote encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p.m.: “Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in December indicates that growth in economic activity picked up in recent quarters.
 The unemployment rate declined but remains elevated.
" Fiscal policy is restraining economic growth, although the extent of restraint is diminishing."
" Inflation has been running below the Committee’s longerrun objective, but longerterm inflation expectations have remained stable."
"Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
" The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and the unemployment rate will gradually decline toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate."
" The Committee recognizes that inflation persistently below its 2 percent objective could pose risks to economic performance, and it is monitoring inflation developments carefully for evidence that inflation will move back toward its objective over the medium term."
"Taking into account the extent of federal fiscal retrenchment since the inception of its current asset purchase program, the Committee continues to see the improvement in economic activity and labor market conditions over that period as consistent with growing underlying strength in the broader economy."
" In light of the cumulative progress toward maximum employment and the improvement in the outlook for labor market conditions, the Committee decided to make a further measured reduction in the pace of its asset purchases."
" The Committee’s sizable and stillincreasing holdings of longerterm securities should maintain downward pressure on longerterm interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative, which in turn should promote a stronger economic recovery and help to ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with the Committee’s dual mandate."
" If incoming information broadly supports the Committee’s expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back toward its longerrun objective, the Committee will likely reduce the pace of asset purchases in further measured steps at future meetings."
" However, asset purchases are not on a preset course, and the Committee’s decisions about their pace will remain contingent on the Committee’s outlook for the labor market and inflation as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases."
"To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee today reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropr iate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens."
" The Committee also reaffirmed its expectation that the current exceptionally low target range for the federal funds r ate of 0 to        ¼ percent will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above  6½ percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee’s 2 percent longerrun goal, and longerterm inflation expectations continue to be well anchored."
" In determining how long to maintain a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy, the Committee will also consider other information, including additional measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings  on financial developments."
" The Committee continues to anticipate, based on its assessment of these factors, that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate well past the time that the unemployment rate declines below 6½ percent, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee’s 2 percent longerrun goal."
" When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced appr oach consistent with its longerrun goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent.” Voting for this action:   Ben Bernanke, William C."
