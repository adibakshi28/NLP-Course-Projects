 M arket participants pointed to incoming economic data released in early February —particularly  data on average hourly earnings —as raising concerns about the prospects for higher inflation and higher interest rates.
 Interest rates rose modestly over the period.
 Rates on overnight federal funds and Eurodollar transactions edged higher relative to the interest rate on excess reserves.
" Consumer price inflation, as measured by the 12 -month percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), remained below 2  percent in January."
  Survey -based measures of longer -run inflation expectations were little changed on balance.
 Gains in total nonfarm payroll employment were strong over the two months ending in February.
 The national unemployment rate remained at 4.1  percent.
" Similarly, the unemployment rates for African Americans, Asians,  and Hispanics were roughly flat, on balance, in recent months."
" The rates of private -sector job openings and quits increased slightly, o n net, over the two months ending in January, and the four -week moving average of initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits continued to be low in early March."
" More broadly, recent readings on key factors that influence consumer spending —including gains in employment and real disposable personal income, along with households’ elevated net worth —continued to be supportive of solid real PCE growth in the near term."
 Growth in real private expenditures for business  equipment and intellectual property appeared to be moderating in the first quarter after increasing at a solid pace in the preceding quarter.
" The change in net exports was a significant drag on real GDP growth in the fourth quarter of 2017, as imports grew rapidly."
" The nominal U.S. international trade deficit widened in January; exports declined, led by lower exports of capital goods and industrial supplies, while imports were about flat."
 The slowing of real import growth following the rapid increase in the fourth quarter suggested that the drag on real GDP growth from net exports would lessen in the first quarter.
" Core PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in consumer food and energy prices, was 1½ percent over that same period."
" The consumer price index (CPI) rose 2¼ percent over the 12 months ending in February, while core CPI inflation was 1¾  percent."
" Recent readings on survey -based measures of longer -run Minutes of the Meeting of March 20–21, 2018Page 3_____________________________________________________________________________________________    inflation expectations —including those from the Michigan survey, the Survey of Professional Forecasters, and the Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants —were little changed on balance."
 Foreign economic activity expanded at a moderate pace in the fourth quarter.
 Real GDP growth picked up in Mexico but slowed a bit in some advanced foreign economies (AFEs) and in emerging Asia.
 Recent indicators pointed to solid economic growth abroad in the first quarter of this year.
 Inflation abroad continued to be boosted by the pass -through to consumer prices  of past increases in oil prices.
" However, excluding food and energy prices, inflation remained subdued in many foreign  economies, including the euro area and Japan."
  Market participants pointed to a larger -thanexpected increase in average hourly earnings in  the January employment report as a factor triggering increased investor concerns about inflation and the associated pace of interest rate increases.
"Monetary policy communications over the intermeeting period —including the January FOMC statement, the minutes  of the January FOMC meeting, and the Chairman’s semiannual testimony to the Congress —were generally viewed by market part icipants as signaling a somewhat stronger economic outlook and thus reinforced expectations for further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate."
" Monetary policy c ommunications, higher -thanexpected domestic price data, and expectations for increases in the supply of Treasury securities following the federal budget agreement in early February contributed to the increase in Treasury yields."
 Measures of inflation com pensation derived from Treasury  Inflation -Protected Securities  were little changed on net.
 The upward pressure on money market rates also showed up in slight increase s in the effective federal funds rate  and the overnight bank funding rate relative to the interest rate on excess reserves.
"  Despite the recent volatility in some financial markets, financing conditions for nonfinancial corporations and house holds remained accommodative over the intermeeting period and continued to support further expansion of economic activity."
" The provision of bank -intermediated credit to businesses slowed further, likely reflecting weak loan demand rather than tight supply."
 Small business owners continued to report accommodative credit supply conditions but also weak demand for credit.
" In commercial real estate markets, loan growth at banks slowed further in January and February."
" In contrast, the Japanese yen appreciated against the dollar, in part supported by safe -haven demand."
" Staff Economic Outlook  The staff projection  for U.S. economic activity  prepared for the March FOMC meeting was somewhat stronger, on balance, than the forecast at the time of the January meeting."
" The near -term forecast for real GDP growth was revised down a little; the incoming spending data were a bit softer than the staff  had expected, and the staff judged that the softness was not associated with residual seasonality in the data."
" However, the slowing in the pace of spending in the first quarter was expected to be transitory , and the mediumterm projection for GDP growth was revised up modestly, largely reflecting the expected boost to GDP from the federal budget agreement enacted in February."
 The unemployment rate was projected to de cline further over the next few years and to continue to run below the staff’s estimate of its longer -run natural rate over this period.
" The projection for inflation over the medium term was revised up a bit, reflecting the slightly tighter resource utilization in the new forecast."
 The rates of both total and core PCE price inflation were projected to be faster in 2018 than in 2017.
 The staff projected that inflation would reach the Committee’s 2 percent objective in 2019.
" The staff viewed the uncertaint y around its projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as similar to the average of the past 20  years."
 The staff saw the risks to the forecasts for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate as balanced.
" On the upside, recent fiscal policy changes could lead to a greater expansion in economic activity over the next few years than the staff projected."
 Risks to the inflation projection also were seen as balanced.
 An upside risk was that inflation could increase more than expected in an economy that was projected to move further above its potential.
 Downside risks included the possibilities that longer -term inflation expectations may have edged lower or that the run of low core inflation readings last year could prove to be more persistent than the staff expected.
"  Minutes of the Meeting of March 20–21, 2018Page 5_____________________________________________________________________________________________    Participants ’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook  In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, members of the Board of Governors and Federal Reserve Bank presidents submitted their projections of the mo st likely outcomes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2018 through 2020 and over the longer run, based on their individual assessments of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate."
" The longer -run projections  represented each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy."
" Job gains had  been strong in recent months , and the unemployment rate had stayed low."
" On a 12 -month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy continued to run below 2 percent."
"  Market -based measures of inflation compensation had increased in recent months but remained low; survey -based measures of longer -term inflation expectations were little changed, on balance."
 Participants noted incoming data suggesting some slowing in the rate of growth of household spending and business fixed investment after strong fourth -quarter readings.
 Participants generally saw the news on spending and the labor market over the past few quarters as being consistent with continued above -trend growth and a further strengthening in labor markets.
" Participants expected that, with further gradual increases in the federal funds rate, economic activity would expand at a solid rate during the remainder of this year and a moderate pace in the medium term , and that labor market conditions would remain strong ."
 Inflation on a 12month basis was expected to move up in coming months and to stabilize around the Committee’s 2 percent objective over the medium term.
 Several participants noted that th e 12month PCE price  inflation rate would likely shift upward  when the March data are released because  the effects of the outsized decline in the prices of cell phone service plans  in March of  last year will drop out of that  calculation.
" Near -term risks to the economic outlook appeared to be roughly balanced, but participants agreed that it would be important to continue to monitor inflation developments closely."
" A number of  participants also suggested that  uncertain ty about whether  all elements of  the tax cuts would be made permanent , or about the implications of higher budget  deficits for fiscal sustainability and  real interest rates, represented  source s of downside risk to the economic outlook."
"Most participants described labor market conditions as  strong , noting that payroll gains had remained  well above the  pace regarded as consistent with absorbing new labor force entrants  over time, the  unemployment rate had stayed low, job openings  had been high, or that  initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits  had been low ."
" Many participants observed that t he labor force participation rate  had been higher recently than they had expected, helping to keep the unemployment rate flat over the past few months despite strong payroll gains ."
" A few participants warned against inferring too much from comparisons of the current low level of the unemployment rate  with historical benchmarks, a rguing that the much higher levels of education of today’s workforce —and the lower average unemployment rate  of more highly educated workers than  less educated workers —suggested that the U.S. economy might be able to sustain lower unemployment rates than was the case  in the 1950s or 1960s ."
"  Regarding  wage growth a t the national level, several participants noted a modest increase , but most still described the pace of wage gains as moderate; a few participants cited this fact  as suggesting that there was  room for the labor market to strengthen somewhat further."
"  A few participants argued that either an absence of pricing power among at least some firms —perhaps stemming from globalization and technological innovation s, including ones  that facilitate  price comparisons —or the ability of firms to find ways to cut costs of production  has been damping inflationary pressures."
 Many participants stated that recent readings from indicators  on inflation and inflation expectations increased their confidence that inflation would ris e to the Committee’s 2 percent objective in coming months and then stabilize around that level; others suggested that downside risks to inflation were subsiding.
" In contrast, a few participants cautioned that, despite increases in market -based measures of  inflation compensation in recent months and the stabilization of some survey measures of inflation expectations, the levels of these indicators remained too low to be consistent with the Committee’s 2 percent inflation objective ."
" In their consideration of monetary policy, participants discussed the implications of recent economic and financial developments f or the appropriate path of the federal funds rate."
" In addition, a ll participants expected inflation on a 12 -month basis to move up in coming months."
" T his expectation partly reflected the arithmetic effect of the  soft readings on inflation in early 2017 dropping out of the calculation; it was  noted that the increase in the inflation rate arising from this source  was widely expected  and, by itself , would not justify a change in the projected path for the federal funds rate."
 Most participants commented that the stronger economic outlook and the somewhat higher inflation readings in recent months had increased the likelihood of progress toward the Committee’s 2 percent inflation objective.
" A few participants suggested that a modest inMinutes of the Meeting of March 20–21, 2018Page 7_____________________________________________________________________________________________    flation overshoot might help  push up longer -term inflation expectations and anchor  them  at a level consistent with the Committee’s  2 percent inflation objective ."
 A number of participants offered their views on the potential benefits and costs associated with an economy operating well above potential for a prolonged period while inflation remained low.
" On the one hand, the associated tightness in the labor market might help speed the return of inflation to the C ommittee’s 2 percent goal  and induce a further increase in labor force participation; on the other hand, an overheated economy could result in significant inflation pressures or lead to financial instability."
" These participants agreed that, even after such an increase in the target range, the stance of monetary policy would remain accommodative, supporting strong labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent i nflation."
 A couple of participants pointed to possible benefits of postponing an increase in the target range for  the federal funds rate until a subsequent meeting; these participants suggested that waiting for additional data to provide more evidence of  a sustained return of the 12 -month inflation rate to 2 percent might more clearly demonstrate the data dependence of the Committee’s decisions and its resolve to achieve the pricestability component of its dual mandate.
" With regard to the mediumterm outlook for monetary policy, all participants saw some further firming of the stance of monetary policy  as likely to b e warranted."
 Several participants commented that this gradual approach was most likely to be conducive to maintaining strong labor market conditions and returning inflation to 2 percent on a sustained basis without resulting in conditions that would eventually require an abrupt policy tightening.
"  A number of  participants indicated that the stronger  outlook fo r economic activity, along with their increased confidence that inflation would return to 2 percent over the medium term, implied that the appropriate path for the federal funds rate over the next few years would likely be slightly steeper than they had pr eviously expected ."
" Participants agreed that the longer -run normal federal funds rate was likely lower than in the past, in part because of secular forces that had put downward pressure on real interest rates."
" Some participants suggested that , at some point, it might be come necessary  to revise statement language to acknowledge that , in pursuit of the Committee’s statutory mandate  and consistent with the median of participants’ policy rate projections in the SEP , monetary policy eventually would likely gradually move from an accommodative stance to being a neutral or restraining factor for economic activity."
"Committee Policy Action  In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that information received since the Committee met in January indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising at a moderate rate."
" Job gains had been strong in recent months, and the unemployment rate had stayed low."
 Recent data suggested that growth rates of household spending and business fixed investment had moderated from their strong fourthquarter readings.
" On a 12 -month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy had continued to run below 2 percent."
" Market -based measures  of inflation compensation had increased in recent months but remained low; survey -based measures of longer -term inflation expectations were little changed, on balance."
 All members viewed the recent data and other developments  bearing on real economic activity as suggesting that the outlook for the economy beyond the current quarter had strengthened in recent months.
" Consequently, m embers expected that, with further gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity would expand at a moderate pace in the medium term, and labor market conditions would remain strong."
" Most members noted that recent readings on inflation, along with the strengthening  of the economic outlook , Page 8Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________    provided support for the view that inflation on a  12month basis would likely move up in coming months and stabilize around the Committee’s 2 percent objective over the medium term."
 Members agreed to continue to monitor inflation developments closely.
" After assessing current conditions and the outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, members voted  to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to  1½ to 1¾ percent."
" They indicated that the stance of monetary policy remained accommodative, thereby supporting strong labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation."
 Members agreed that the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate would depend on their assessments of realized and expected economic conditions relative to the Committee’s objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.
" They reiterated that this assessment would take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
 Members also agreed that they would carefully monitor actual and expected developments in inflati on in relation to the Committee’ s symmetric inflation goal .
 They judged that raising the target range gradually would balance the risks to the outlook for inflation and unemployment and was most likely to support continued economic expansion.
” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00  p.m.: “Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in January indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising at a moderate rate.
" Job gains have been strong in recent months, and the unemployment rate has stayed low ."
 Recent data suggest that growth rates of household spending and business fixed investment have moderated from their strong fourth -quarter readings .
" On a 12 -month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy have continued to Minutes of the Meeting of March 20–21, 2018Page 9_____________________________________________________________________________________________    run below 2  percent."
" Market -based measures of inflation compensation have increased in recent months but remain low; survey -based measures of longer -term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance."
" Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
" The Committee expects that, with further gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace in the medium term and labor market conditions will remain strong ."
 Inflation on a 12 -month basis is expected to move up in coming months and to stabilize around the Committee ’s 2 percent  objective over the medium term .
" Near -term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced, but the Committee is monitoring inflation developments close ly."
"In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 1½  to 1¾ percent."
" The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting strong labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent  inflation."
"In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2  percent inflation ."
" This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on fina ncial and international developments ."
 The Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to its symmetric inflation goal.
" To support the Committee ’s decision to raise the target range for the federal funds rate, the Board of Governors voted unanimously to raise the interest rates on required and excess reserve balances ¼  percent age point, to 1¾ percent , effective March  22, 2018 ."
" (Secretary’s note:  Subsequently, the Federal Reserve Banks of Chicago and Minneapolis were informed by the Secretary of the Board of the Board’s approval of their establishment of a primary credit rate of 2¼  percent, effective March 22, 2018.)  The second vote of the Board also encompassed approval of the establishment of the interest rates for secondary and seasonal credit under the existing formulas for computing such rates."
" Page 10Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________    Summary of Economic Projections In conjunction with the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting held on March 20 –21, 2018, meeting participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real gross domestic product (GDP) growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2018 to 2020 and over the longer run.1  Each participant’s projections were based on information available at the time of the meeting, together with his or her assessment of appr opriate monetary policy —including a path for the federal funds rate and its longer -run value —and assumptions about other factors likely to affect economic outcomes."
" The longer -run projections represent each participant’s assessment of the value to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy.2  “Appropriate monetary policy” is defined as the future path of policy that each participant deems most likely to foster outcomes for economic activity and inflation that best satisfy his or her individual interpretation of the statutory mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability."
 All participants who submitted longer -run projections expected that real GDP in 2018 would expand at a pace exceeding their individual estimates of the longer -run growth rate of real GDP.
" Participants generally saw real GDP growth moderating somewhat in each of the following two years, with almost all participants who submitted longer -run projections anticipating that real GDP growth in 2020 would be at or within a few tenths of a percentage point of their longer -run estimates."
" All participants who submitted longer -run projections expected that, throughout the projection period, the unemployment rate would run below their estimates of its longer -run level."
" All participants projected that inflation, as measured by the four -quarter percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), would rise to or toward the Committee’s 2  percent objective this year and would be at or a little above that objective by 2020."
" Compared with the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) from December, a substantial majority of participants marked up their projections for real GDP growth and lowered their projections for the unemployment rate; participants indicated that these revisions reflected a number of factors, such as                                                  1 Three members of the Board of Governors were in office at the time of the March 2018 meeting, one member fewer than in December 2017."
" changes in fiscal policy, a stronger outlook for economic growth abroad, or recent strong job ga ins."
" For inflation, a majority of participants made slight upward revisions to their projections; these revisions were attributed to recent price data and the effects of a stronger economic outlook than in the December SEP."
" As shown in figure 2, participants generally continued to expect that the evolution of the economy relative to their objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation would likely warrant further gradual increases in the federal funds rate."
" As in December, most participants judged the risks around their projections for real GDP growth, the unemployme nt rate, and inflation to be broadly balanced."
" The Outlook for Economic Activity  The median of participants’ projections for the growth rate of real GDP, conditional  on their individual assessments  of appropriate monetary policy, was 2.7  percent for this year and 2.4  percent for next year."
" The median projection for real GDP growth in 2020 was 2.0 percent, a touch above the 1.8  percent median of participants’ longer -run estimates."
" Most participants cited federal fiscal policy developments —specifically,  the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 —as boosting their projections for economic activity over the next couple of years."
" Several participants mentioned other factors that influenced their economic 2 One participant did not submit longer -run projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, or the federal funds rate."

" Compared with the December SEP, the medians of participants’ projections for real GDP growth this year and next year  were up a few tenths of a percentage point ."
"Consistent with their projections for economic activity, almost all participants expected labor market conditions to strengthen further over the projection period."
" The medians of projections for the unemployment rate showed that rate stepping down from 4.1  percent in the final quarter of 2017 to 3.8 percent in the final quarter of this year, and then to 3.6  percent in the final quarters of 2019 and 2020."
 The median of participants’ estimates of the longer -run unemployment rate was 4.5  percent.
" Compared with the December SEP, almost all participants marked down their unemployment rate projections."
" Some participants also lowered their estimates of the longer -run level of the unemployment rate, lea ding to a small decline in the corresponding median projection."
Figures 3.A and 3.B show the distributions of participants’ projections for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate from 2018 to 2020 and in the longer run.
 The distributions of individual projections for real GDP growth this year and next year shifted up noticeably from those in the December SEP; participants’ projections ranged from 2.5 to 3.0  percent in 2018 and from 2.0 to 2.8 percent in 2019.
" By contrast, the distributions of proje cted real GDP growth in 2020 and in the longer run shifted up modestly since December."
" Consistent with participants’ generally more upbeat outlook for real GDP growth, the distributions of individual projections for the unemployment rate were lower than the corresponding distributions in December for each year of the projection period."
 The Outlook for Inflation  The medians of participants’ projections for both total and core PCE price inflation were 1.9  percent in 2018 —with all participants anticipating that each measure would rise from its 2017 rate —and 2.1  percent by 2020.
 Figures 3.C and 3.D pro vide information on the distributions of participants’ views about the outlook for inflation.
" Participants generally made minor upward adjustments to their inflation projections, resulting in slight shifts of the distributions to the right relative to the  distributions in December."
 Appropriate Monetary Policy Figure 3.E provides the distribution of pa rticipants’ judgments regarding the appropriate target —or midpoint of the target range —for the federal funds rate at the end of each year from 2018 to 2020 and in the longer run.
" The distributions of projected policy rates through 2020 shifted modestly higher, consistent with the revisions to participants’ projections of real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation."
" This view was predicated  on several factors, including a judgment that a gradual path likely would appropriately balance the risks associated with, among other considerations, the possibility that inflation pressures and financial imbalances could build if economic activity were to run well above its long -run sustainable level and the possibility that the forces depressing inflation could prove to be more persistent than currently anticipated."
 Another factor mentioned was the view that the neutral real interest rate was historica lly low and would likely move up only slowly.

" As a reference, table 2 provides measures of forecast uncertainty, based on the forecast errors of various private and government forecasts over the past 20 years, for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and total PCE inflation."
" Participants’ assessments of the level of uncert ainty surrounding their individual economic projections are shown in the bottomleft panels of figures 4.A, 4.B, and 4.C.  Nearly all participants viewed the degree of uncertainty attached to their economic projections about real GDP growth, the unemployme nt rate, and inflation as broadly similar to the average of the past 20  years, a view that was essentially unchanged from December.3 Because the fan charts are constructed to be symmetric around the median projections, they do not reflect any asymmetr ies in the balance of risks that participants may see in their economic projections."
" Participants’ assessments of the balance of risks to their economic projections are shown in the bottom -right panels  of figures 4.A, 4.B, and 4.C.  As in December, most participants judged the risks to their projections of real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, total inflation, and core inflation as broadly balanced —in other words, as broadly consistent with a symmetric  fan chart."
" Participants who saw the risks as skewed typically judged that the balance of risks was tilted toward stronger GDP growth, lower unemployment rates, and higher inflation."
 ±1.5 ±2.0 ±2.0 Unemployment rate1 .
 ±0.9 ±1.0 ±1.1 Short -term interest rates3 .
" As described in the box “Forecast Uncertainty,” under cert ain assumptions, there is about a 70 percent probability that actual outcomes for real GDP, unemployment, consumer prices, and the federal funds rate will be in ranges implied by the average size of projection errors made in the past."
"  were little changed overall, with one more participant reporting that the risks to the unemployment rate were weighted to the downside and two fewer participants reporting that the risks to either total or core PCE inflation were weighted to the downside."
" In discussing the uncertainty and  risks surrounding their projections, most participants noted that the magnitude and timing of the economic effects of recent changes in fiscal policy were uncertain or that fiscal policy developments posed upside risks to real economic activity."
" A few participants noted that a prolonged period of tight labor markets posed risks of higher inflation, could fuel financial imbalances, and might contribute to heighte ned recession risks."
" Because the Committee adjusts the federal funds rate in response to actual and prospective developme nts over time in real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation, uncertainty surrounding the used to assess the uncertainty and risks attending the participants’ projections."

"The conﬁdence interval is not strictly consistent with theprojections for the federal funds rate, primarily because these projections are not forecasts of the likeliest outcomes forthe federal funds rate, but rather projections of participants’ individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy.Still, historical forecast errors provide a broad sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rategenerated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policythat may be appropriate to oﬀset the eﬀects of shocks to the economy.The conﬁdence interval is assumed to be symmetric except when it is truncated at zero—the bottom of the lowesttarget range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted in the past by the Committee."
This truncation wouldnot be intended to indicate the likelihood of the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary policyaccommodation if doing so was judged appropriate.
"Because currentconditions may diﬀer from those that prevailed, on average, over the previous 20 years, the width and shape of theconﬁdence interval estimated on the basis of the historical forecast errors may not reﬂect FOMC participants’ currentassessments of the uncertainty and risks around their projections.* The conﬁdence interval is derived from forecasts of the average level of shortterm interest rates in the fourthquarter of the year indicated; more information about these data is available in table 2."
The shaded area encompassesless than a 70 percent conﬁdence interval if the conﬁdence interval has been truncated at zero.Page 16Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________          Forecast Uncertainty The economic projections provided by the members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks inform discussions of monetary policy among policymakers and can aid public understanding of the basis for policy actions.
" Thus, in setting the stance of monetary policy, participants consider not only what appears to be the most likely economic outcome as embodied in their projections, but also the range of alternative possibilities, the likelihood of their occurring, and the potential costs to the economy should they occur."
" Table 2 summarizes the average historical accuracy of a range of forecasts, including those reported in past Monetary Policy Report s and those prepared by the Federal Reserve Board’s staff in advance of meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)."
" The corresponding 70  percent confidence intervals for overall inflation would be 1.1 to 2.9  percent in the curr ent year, 1.0 to 3.0 percent in the second year, and 0.9 to 3.1  percent in the third year ."
" Figures 4.A through 4.C illustrate these confidence bounds in “fan charts” that are symmetric and centered on the medians of FOMC participants’ projections for GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation."
" In particular, the unemployment rate cannot be negative; furthermore, the risks around a particular projection might be tilte d to either the upside or the downside, in which case the corresponding fan chart would be asymmetrically positioned around the median projection."
" These judgments are summarized in the lower -right panels of figures 4.A through 4.C.  As with real activity and inflation, the outlook for the future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable uncertainty ."
 This uncertainty arises primarily because each participant ’s assessment of the appropriate stance of monetary policy depends importantly on the evolution of real activity and inflation over time.
 The final line in table  2 shows the error ranges for forecasts of short -term interest rates.
" It should be noted, however, that these confidence intervals are not strictly consistent with the projections for the federal funds rate, as these projections are not forecasts of the m ost likely quarterly outcomes but rather are projections of participants’ individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy and are on an end -ofyear basis."
" However, the forecast errors should provide a sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy that would be appropriate to offset the effects of shocks to the economy."
 This approach to the construction of the federal funds rate fan chart would be merely a convention; it would not have any implications for possible future policy decisions regarding the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so were appropriate.
