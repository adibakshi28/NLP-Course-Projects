 2 Attended the discussions of the long -run monetary policy implementation framework and financial developments.
"Kiley, Senior Adviser, Division of Research and Statistics, and Sen ior Associate Director, Division of Financial Stability, Board of Governors  3 Attended the discussion of the longrun monetary policy implementation framework."
"Leonard,3 Antoine Martin,3 Ed Nosal,3 Anna Paulson,3 Joe Peek, and Patricia Zobel,3 Vice Presidents, Federal Reserve Banks of Dallas, Chicago, New York, New York, Chicago, Chicago, Boston, and New York, respectively   John Fernald, Senior Research Advisor, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisc o  Long -Run Monetary Policy Implementation Fram ework The staff provided several briefings that reviewed progress on a long -term effort begun in July 2015 to evaluate potential long -run frameworks for monetary policy implementation."
" The staff described the recent experience of several central banks of advanced foreign economies  (AFEs)  in implementing monetary policy, noting that they use a wide variety of frameworks to control short -term interest rates and that their approaches have evolved over time."
" For example, foreign central banks vary in their choice of the interest rate used to communicate monetary policy; in their approach to the provision of reserve balances; and in their use of policies , such as largescale asset purchases, various funding programs, and negative interest rates,  to supplement more traditional means of policy implementation."
 The staff also described the Federal Reserve’s experience in implementing monetary policy during the rece nt financial crisis.
" Before the financial crisis, traditional implementation tools —relatively smallsized open market operations and discount window lending —were adequate for interest rate control even during periods of stress."
" Finally, the staff noted that various aspects of  U.S. money markets, which determine shortterm interest rates and are important for transmitting monetary policy, have changed since the financial crisis."
" Taken together , these factors may, for example,  raise the long -run demand for safe assets, including reserve balances, and they should help make U."
" One key consideration discussed by policymakers was the appropriate amount of flexibility that an implementation framework might have —for example, the extent to which a framework could readily enable interest rate control under a wide range of economic and financial circumstances."
" With neutral interest rates potentially remaining quite low, policymakers also observed that , in order to promote the Federal Reserve’s policy objectives,  the framework should have the capacity to supplement conventional policy accommodation with other measures when short -term nominal interest rates are near zer o."
 Policymakers emphasized that the relationship between the monetary policy implementation framework and financial stability considerations would require careful attention.
" However, the factors affecting market rates, as well as  the relationships between the policy interest rate and other short -term interest rates, would need to be well understood  in deciding on a particular policy rate ."
Staff Review of the Economic Situation  The information reviewed for the July 26 –27 meeting indicated that labor market conditions generally improved in June and that growth in real gross domestic product (GDP) was moderate in the second quarter.
" Consumer price inflation continued to run below the Committee’s longer -run objective of 2 percent, restrained in part by earlier decreases in energy prices and in prices of non -energy imports."
" Most survey -based measures of longer -run inflation expectations were little changed, on balance, while market -based measures of inflation compensation remained low."
" Total nonfarm payroll employment increased briskly in June, but the increase for the second quarter as a whole was noticeably slower than in the first quarter."
" The unemployment rate rose to 4.9  percent in June, partly reversing its decline in the previous m onth."
" The labor force participation rate edged up in June, while the  employmentto-population ratio edged down."
 The four -week moving average of initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits remained low through mid -July.
"The unemployment rates for African Americans and for Hispanics stayed above the rate for whites, al though  the differentials in jobless rates across the different groups were similar to those before the most recent recession."
 Growth in real personal consumption expenditures (PCE) appeared to have picked up in the second quarter.
" The apparent pickup in real PCE growth was consistent with recent readings on key factors that influence consumer spending, including continued gains in real disposable personal income and in households’ net worth."
" The U.S. international trade deficit widened in May, as imports rose and exports declined slightly."
" These recent indicators , combined with data from earlier in the year, suggested that net exports made a near -neutral contribution to the growth of real GDP in the first half of 2016."
" Core PCE price inflation, which exc ludes changes in food and energy prices, was a little above 1½ percent over the same 12 -month period, held down in part by decreases in the prices of nonenergy imports over much of this period and the passthrough of the declines in energy prices to the prices of other goods and services."
" Over the 12 months ending in June, total consumer prices as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) rose 1 percent, while core CPI inflation was about 2¼ percent."
 The Michigan survey measure of longer -run inflation e xpectations edged up in June and was unchanged in early July.
" Other measures of longer -run inflation expectations —including those from the Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants —were generally little changed, on balance, in recent months."
" The pace of foreign real GDP growth appeared to slow in the second quarter, driven in large part by temporary factors such as wildfires in Canada and, to a lesser extent, by a deceleration of activity in the euro area."
" In the emerging market e conomies (EMEs), a pickup in growth in China in the second quarter, supported by policy stimulus, appeared to be more than offset by slower growth in Latin America."
" In the United Kingdom, early indicators following the June 23 referendum on exit from the EU (“Brexit”) pointed to a slowdown in economic growth."
" Inflation in the AFEs picked up in the second quarter, largely reflecting some increase in energy prices, but generally remained low."
 Inflation also remained subdued in the EMEs.  Staff Review of th e Financial Situation  Domestic financial conditions remained accommodative over the intermeeting period.
" The expected policy path implied by market quotes fell further in the aftermath of the Brexit vote, but it later retraced most of the earlier declines, supported by better -thanexpected domestic data releases —particularly the employment and retail sales reports for June —as well as improved sentiment regarding the possible near -term im plications of Brexit ."
" Market participants attributed the decline in Treasury yields to a variety of factors, including expectations for a more accommodative stance of monetary policy by major central banks; an intensification of demand for safehaven assets immediately following the Minutes of the Meeting of July 26–27, 2016Page 5_____________________________________________________________________________________________     Brexit vote; and strong demand by  global institutional investors for higher -yielding U.S. fixed -income assets following decreases in sovereign yields in Europe and Japan, in some cases further into negative territory."
" The small net decline in  longer -term nominal Treasury yields over the period was attributable to a comparable drop in real yields, as longer -term inflation compensation measures based on Treasury I nflation -Protected Securities and inflation swaps were little changed on net."
" The growth of commercial and industrial (C&I) lending on banks’ books slowed in June , but expansion of such loans continued through early July."
" This pattern was consistent with the responses to the July 2016 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lendi ng Practices (SLOOS), in which modest net fractions of respondents indicated that they had tightened their C&I lending standards and experienced weaker demand for such loans during the second quarter."
" Interest rates on 30 -year fixed -rate mortgages decreased  further, partly reflecting the declines in yields on Treasury securities."
 Banks also reported a broad -based pickup in demand across most major categories of home -purchas e loans.
 Growth of auto loans remained robust Page 6Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________     even though a modest net fraction of respondents to the July SLOOS indicated that they had tightened their standards for such loans.
 Prices of risky assets and advanced -economy bond yields also fell in response to the heightened uncertainty and expectations of slower economic growth.
" Later in the period, however, investors’ concerns eased  substantially on the resolution of some of the near -term political uncertainty in the United Kingdom, increased expectations for additional policy stimulus in Europe and Japan , and U.S. data on employment and retail sales in June that exceeded market expectations."
" Some AFE sovereign yields recovered partially from their postBrexit lows , but U.K. longterm yields remained low on expectations of slower growth there and further monetary policy accommodation."
" However, European bank equities, especially those of Italian banks, underperformed, reflecting investor fears that lower interest rates will continue to weigh on profitability."
" Staff Economic Outlook  In the U.S. economic projection prepared by the staff for the July FOMC meeting, real GDP growth was estimated to have picked up in the second quarter, consistent with the forecast in June."
" However, the projected stepup in real GDP growth over the second half of this year was marked down a little, partly reflecting softer news on construction."
" The forecast for real GDP growth in 2017 and 2018 was little revised, as the positive effects of a slightly lower assumed path for i nterest rates and a stronger trajectory for household wealth were mostly offset by the restraint from a weaker outlook for foreign GDP growth and a slightly stronger path for the foreign exchange value of the dollar."
 The unemployment rate w as expected to remain flat over the second half of this year and then to gradually decline through the end of 2018 .
" Over this period, the unemployment rate was projected to run somewhat below the staff’s estimate of its longer -run natural rate."
" The staff’ s forecast for consumer price inflation over the second half of 2016 was a little lower than in the previous projection, as recent declines in crude oil prices were expected to hold down consumer energy prices."
" Thereafter, the forecast for inflation was essentially unrevised."
" The staff continued to project that inflation would increase over the next several years, as energy prices and the prices of nonenergy imports were expected to begin steadily rising this year and as resource utilization was expected  to tighten further."
" However, inflation was still projected to be slightly below the Committee’s longer -run objective of 2 percent in 2018."
"Minutes of the Meeting of July 26–27, 2016Page 7_____________________________________________________________________________________________     The staff viewed the uncertainty around its July projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflat ion as similar to the average of the past 20 years."
" Consistent with the downside risks to aggregate demand, the staff viewed the risks to its outlook for the un employment rate as tilted to the upside."
" The risks to the projection for inflation were still judged as weighted to the downside, reflecting the possibility that longer -term inflation expectations may have edged lower ."
"Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook  In their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants agreed that the information received over the intermeeting period indicated that the labor market had strengthened and that economic activity had been expanding at a moderate rate."
 Job gains were strong in June following weak growth in May.
" Inflation had continued to run below the Committee’s 2 percent longer -run objective, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and in prices of non -energy imports ."
" Market -based me asures of i nflation compensation remained low; most survey -based measures of longer -run inflation expectations were little changed, on balance, in recent months."
" They continued to anticipate that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity would expand at a moderate pace and labor market indicators would strengthen."
" Inflation was expected to remain low in the near term, in part because of earlier declines in energy prices, but to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of past declines in energy and import prices dissipated and the labor market strengthened  further."
 Participants generally agreed that the Committee should continue to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments.
" Growth in consumer spending was estimated to have rebounded in the second quarter from the slow pace in the first quarter , as monthly gains in retail sales were strong through June ."
" Participants cited a number of factors that had likely been supporting household spending, including solid real income growth, gains in house and equity values, low gas oline  prices, and favorable levels of c onsumer confidence."
" However, p articipants commented on a number of factors suggesting that the housing sector was likely to continue to improve, albeit gradually:  Rising sales of existing hom es, responses to the July SLOOS  pointing to stronger demand for residential mortgage loans , and  the steady increase  in house prices were seen as evidence of rising demand."
" Moreover, several participants noted positive reports on residential con struction activity from business contacts in their Districts, with  a few suggesting that shortages of lots and skilled labor , rather than low demand,  might be  contributing to the recent slowing."
" Based on conversations with their contacts, participants discuss ed a number of factors that may have been contributing to businesses’ cautious approach to investment spending , including conc ern about the likelihood of an extended period of slow  economic growth, both in the United States and abroad ; narrowing profit margins ; and uncertainty about prospects for government policies."
The labor market report for June appeared to confirm participants’ earlier assessments that the small gain in payroll employment in May likely had substantially understated its underlying pace.
" The sharp rebound  in payroll employment gains  put the average monthly increase in jobs over the three months ending in June at about 150,000."
" Al though this pace was noticeably slower than the average rate during  2015 and the first quarter of 2016, many participants viewed it as consistent with continued strengthening in labor market conditions and  with a further gradual decline in the unemployment rate."
" The unemployment rate rose in June after having declined in May, but the labor force participation rate ticked up, the rate of involuntary parttime employment more than reversed its increase in May, and the broader U6 measure of labor underutilization continued to move down."
" Al -though most participants judged that labor market conditions were at or approaching those consistent with maximum employment, their views on the implications for progress on the Committee’s  policy  objectives varied."
" Some of them believed that a convergence to a more moderate, sustainable pace of job gains would soon be necessary to prevent an unwanted increase in inflationary pressures."
 O ther participants continued to judge that labor utilization remained below that consistent with the Committee’s maximumemployment objective .
" These participants  noted  that progress in reducing slack in the labor market had slowed, citing relatively little chan ge, on net, since the beginning of the year in the unemployment rate, the n umber of persons working part time for economic reasons , the employment -topopulation ratio, labor force participation, or rates of job openings and quits."
 Available information on inflation suggested that the change in headline PCE prices for the 12 months ending in June continued to run well below the Committee’s longer -run objective and that the 12month change in core PCE prices likely remained near its May level of 1.6 percent .
" On a 12month -change basis,  core PCE inflation had risen  from 1.3 percent a year earlier, but it continued to be held down by the passthrough  of earlier declines in energy prices and by  soft prices of imports."
" Core PCE inflation over the first half of 2016 was expected to have been close to an annual rate of 2 percent , but it was noted  that some of the increase likely reflected transitory effects that would be in part reversed during the second half of the year."
" L onger -run inflation expectations , as reported in t he Michigan survey , were little changed in June  and early July."
" The reading from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York ’s Survey of Consumer Expectations for inflation three years ahead moved up further in  June, returning  to near its level of a year earlier."
" But those price moves were subsequently reversed , likely  in Minutes of the Meeting of July 26–27, 2016Page 9_____________________________________________________________________________________________     response to expectations for policy actions by some major central banks, the resolution of some of the political uncertainty in the United Kingdom, and better -thanexpected data on U.S. economic activity."
" Overall, U.S. financial conditions eased during the intermeeting period:  Major equity indexes rose, longer -term interest rates fell, credit sprea ds narrowed, and the broad index of the foreign exc hange value of the dollar was little changed ."
" However, during the discussion, several participants  commented on a few  developments , including potential overvaluation in the market for  CRE , the elevated level of equity values relative to expected earnings, and the  incentives for investors to reach for yield in an environment of continued low interest rates."
" It was also pointed out that  investors potentially were becoming more comfortable locking in current yields in an environment in which low interest rates were expected to pers ist, rather than engaging in  the type of speculative behavior that could pose financial stability concerns ."
" They indicated that their forecasts for economic growth, the labor market, and inflation had changed little  over the intermeeting period."
" Moreover, the employment report for  June, along with other recent information that suggested that real GDP rose at a moderate rate in the second quarter, provided some reassurance that a sharp slowdown in employment and economic activity was not under way."
 Most participants anticipated that economic growth would move up to a rate somewhat above its longer -run trend during the second half of 2016 and that the labor market would strengthen further .
" As a consequence of Brexit,  economic growth in the United Kingdom and , to a lesser extent , in the euro area would likely  be slower than previously anticipated ."
 Some participants noted that the weak capital positions and high levels of nonperforming loans at some  European banks could also weigh on economic growth in the region.
 A few others noted uncertainty about the strength of domestic economic activity  going forward .
" Page 10Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________     In discussing the outlook for the labor market, most participants viewed  some  further strengthening  in labor market indicators  as consistent with achieving the Committee’s maximumemployment objective ."
" With inflation still below the Committee’s longer -run objective and likely to continue  to respond only slowly to somewhat tighter labor markets, most also saw relatively low  risk that a further  gradual  strengthening of the labor market would generate an unwanted  increase in inflationary pressures."
" Nevertheless , a few participants continued to caution about the risks to the inflation outlook from  overshooting the natural rate  of unemployment."
 Some indic ated that a step -down  in monthly job gains seemed appropriate as labor market conditions approached those consistent with the Committee’s  maximum -employment objective  and that a more moderate pace of hiring could still be consistent with further increases  in labor utilization.
" However, several others  were concerned that if labor market slack diminish ed more slowly than they had previously anticipated , progress on the Committee’s maximum -employment and inflation objectives  could be delayed ."
"Regarding the outlook for inflation, incoming information appeared to be broadly in line with most participants’ earlier expectations  that inflation would gradually rise to 2 percent over the medium term ."
" Most noted that the firming in various indicators of core inflation over the past year , together with signs  that the direct and indirect effects of earlier declines in energy prices and prices of nonoil imports had begun to fade , provide d support for their forecasts."
" However, other participants expressed greater uncertainty about the trajectory of inflation."
" They  saw little evidence that inflation was responding much to higher lev els of resource utilization  and suggested  that the natural rate of unemployment, and the responsiveness of inflation to labor market conditions, may be  lower than most current estimate s."
" Several viewed the risks to their inflation forecasts as weighted to the downside, particularly in light of the still -low level of measures of longer -run inflation expectations and inflation compensation and the likelihood that disinflationary pressures from abroad would persist."
" Against the backdrop of  their views  of the economic outlook, participants discussed  the conditions that c ould warrant taking another step in removing monetary policy accommodation."
" W ith inflation continuing to run below the Committee’s 2 percent objective , many judged that it was appropriate to wait for addition al information that would allow them to evaluate the underlyi ng momentum in economic activity and  the labor market and whether  inflation wa s continuing to rise gradually to 2  percent as expected."
" Several suggested that the Committee would  likely have ample time to react if inflation rose  more quickly than they currently anticipate d, and they preferred to defer another increase in the federal funds rate  until they were more confident that inflation was moving closer to 2 percent on a sustained basis ."
" In addition, al -though nearterm downside risks  to the outlook  had diminished over the intermeeting period, some participants stressed that the Committee needed to consider the constraints  on the conduct of monetary policy  associated with  proximity to the effective lower bound on shortterm interest rates ."
 These participants concluded that the Committee should wait to take another step in remov ing accommodation until the data on economic activity provide d a greater level of confidence that economic growth was strong enough to withstand a possible downward shock to demand.
" However, some other participants viewed recent economic developments as indicating that labor market conditions were at or close to those consistent with maximum employment and expected that the recent progress in reaching the Committee’s inflation objective would continue , even with further steps to gradually remove monetary policy accommodation."
A few participants  pointed out that various benchmarks for assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy  supported taking another step in removing policy accommodation.
 A few also empha sized the risk to the economic expansion  that would be  associated with allowing labor market conditions to tighten to an extent that could lead to an unwanted  buildup of inflation pressures and thus eventually require a rapid increase in the federal funds rate.
" In addition, several expressed concern that  an extended period of low interest rates risked intensifying incentives for investors to reach for yield and could lead to the misallocation of capi tal and mispricing of risk, with possible adverse consequences for financial stability ."
"Committee Policy Action  In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that the information received since the Committee met in June indicated that the labor market had strengthened and that economic activity had been expanding at a moderate rate."
" They noted that the most recent employment report showed that job gains Minutes of the Meeting of July 26–27, 2016Page 11_____________________________________________________________________________________________     had been strong  in June following weak growth in May, and, on balance, payrolls and other labor market indicators pointed to some increase in labor utilization in recent months."
" Inflation continued to run below the Committee’s 2 percent longer -run objective, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and in prices of nonenergy imports."
" Market -based measures of inflation compensation remained low over the intermeeting period, and most survey -based measures of longer -term inflation expectations were , on balance,  little changed."
" With respect to the economic outlook and its implications for monetary policy, members continued to expect that, with gradual ad justments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity would expand at a moderate pace and labor market indicators would strengthen."
" They agreed that the strong rebound in job gains in June —together with a rise in the labor force participation rate and a decline in the number of individuals who were working part time for economic reasons —suggested that, despite the very soft employment report for May, labor market conditions remained solid and slack had continued to diminish."
" A couple of members indicated  that, in light of their judgment that labor market conditions were at or close to the Committee’s objectives, some moderation in employment gains was to be expected ."
" Members continued to expect inflation to remain low in the near term, in part because of earlier declines in energy prices, but most anticipated that inflation would rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of past declines in energy and import prices dissipated and the labor market strengthened further."
" Nonetheless, in light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, members agreed that they would continue to carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward the Committee’s inflation goal."
"After assessing the outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, as well as the risks  around that outlook, members decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at ¼ to ½ percent at this meeting."
" Members generally agreed that, before taking  another step in removing monetary accommodation, it was prudent to accumulate  more data in order to gauge the underlying momentum in the labor market and economic activity."
 A couple of members preferred also to wait for more evidence that inflation would rise to 2 percent on a sustained basis.
" One member preferred to raise the target range for the federal funds rate at th e current  meeting, citing  the easing of financial conditions since the U.K. referendum, the return to trend economic growth, solid job growth, and inflation moving toward 2 percent."
"Members again agreed that, in determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee would assess rea lized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation."
" They noted that this assessment would take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators  of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
" In that regard, members judged it appropriate to continue to leave their policy options open and maintain the flexibility to adjust the stance of policy based on  incoming information and it s implications for the Committee’s assessment of the  outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation , as well as the risks to the outlook."
 Most  members noted that effective  communications  from the Committee would help the public understand how monetary policy  might respond to incoming data and developments.
 The Committee also directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve’s agency mortgage -backed securities transactions.” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00  p.m.: “Informatio n received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in June indicates that the labor market strengthened and that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate rate.
 Job gains were strong in June following weak growth in May.
" Inflation has continued to run below the Committee’s 2  percent long errun objective, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and in prices of nonenergy imports."
" Market -based measures of inflation compensation remain low; most survey -based measures of longer -term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance, in recent months."
"  Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
" The Committee currently expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market indicators will strengthen."
" Inflation is expected to remain low in the near term, in part because of earlier declines in energy prices, but to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of past declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further."
 The Committee continues to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial dev elopments.
" The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, Minutes of the Meeting of July 26–27, 2016Page 13_____________________________________________________________________________________________     thereby supporting further improvement in labor market conditions and a  return to 2  percent inflation."
" In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2  percent inflation."
" This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
" In light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2  percent, the Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal."
" Information available since the June FOMC meeting showed solid employment growth, economic growth near  its trend, and inflation outcomes aligning with the Committee’s objective."
" She believed that monetary policy should respond to these developments by gradually removing accommodation, consistent with the prescriptions of several frameworks for assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy."
" Consistent with the Committee’s decision to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the Board of Governors took no action to change the interest rates on reserves or discount r ates."
"Secretary’s note: The following statement regarding the June 14–15, 2016, FOMC meeting was inadvertently omitted from minutes of that meeting:   “Consistent with the Committee’s decision to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the Board of Governors took no action to change the interest rates on reserves or discount rates."
