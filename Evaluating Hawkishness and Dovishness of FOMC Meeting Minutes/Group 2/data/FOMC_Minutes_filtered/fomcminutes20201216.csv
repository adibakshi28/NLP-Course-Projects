" Longer -term Treasury yields rose modestly, driven by increases in inflation compensation."
 Survey responses continued to indicate median expectations of headline personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation above 2 percent and an unemployment rate of around 4 percent at Page 2Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________   the time of the first increase in the target range for the federal funds rate .
" A majority of Desk survey respondents indicated that they expected the Committee to revise its guidance on asset purchases at the current meeting, with many noting that they anticipated the announcement of some form of qualitative, outcome -based guidance tied to inflation,  the unemployment rate, or both."
" The size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet increased to around $7.3 trillion over the intermeeting period, driven by growth in securities holdings."

" Labor market conditions improved further over Octo ber and November, although employment continued to be well below its level at the beginning of the year."
 Consumer price inflation through October —as measured by the 12 -month percentage change in the PCE price index —remained notably below the rates seen in early 2020.
" Total nonfarm payroll employment continued to increase solidly over October and November, though the rate of monthly job gains was more moderate than the substantial third -quarter pace."

 The unemployment rate moved down further and stood at 6.7 percent in November.
 The unemployment rates for African Americans and Hispanics each declined but remained well above the national average.
 Both the labor force participation rate and the employmentto- population ratio in November were above their levels of two months earlier.
 The four -week moving average of initial claims for unemployment insurance was only slightly lower in early December than it had been in late October.
 Weekly estimates of privatesector payrolls constructed by Federal Reserve Board staff using data provided by the payroll processor ADP suggested that the four -week average of private employment gains in early December was lower than it was in mid -November.
 The substantial employment losses over the past year were most significant among lower -wage workers—a situation that had led to outsized increases in these average measures of earnings and compensation that were not indicative of tight labor market conditions.
" Total PCE price inflation was 1.2 percent over the 12 months ending in October, and it continued to be held down by relatively weak aggregate demand and the declines in consumer energy prices seen earlier in 2020."
" Core PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in consumer energy prices and many consumer food prices, was 1.4 percent over the same period, whil e the trimmed mean measure of 12 -month PCE price inflation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas was 1.7  percent in October."
" In November, the  12month change in the con sumer price index (CPI) was 1.2 percent, while core CPI inflation was 1.6 percent over the same period."
" The latest readings on surveybased measures of longer -run inflation expectations edged up, though each remained within the range in which it has fluctuated in recent years; in November and early December, the University of Mi chigan Surveys of Consumers measure for the next 5  to 10 years was slightly above its level in October, while the 3year-ahead measure produced by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York rose a bit in November."
" Housing -sector activity advanced further, on balance, in October, supported in part by low interest rates."
" Federal defense spending continued to rise in October and November, although federal employment declined with the layoff of temporary census workers."
 Page 4Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________   The nominal U.S. international trade deficit widened in October.
 Goods imports in October rose above their January level after several months of strong growth.
" Goods exports, however, had only r ecovered three -fourths  of their decline since January despite brisk growth in agricultural exports."
" After a strong rebound in the third quarter, foreign economic growth appeared to slow sharply in recent months."
" Even so, with restrictions less severe and more targeted than in the spring, the hit to economic activity looked to be more limited."
 Economic growth appeared to hold up better in several emerging Asian economies .
" In these economies, effective virus control was supporting domestic demand, while strong external demand boosted exports."
 Inflationary pressures remained subdued in most foreign economies amid substantial economic slack.
 The rise in longer -term Treasury yields was concentrated in inflation compensation.
 The 5 -year and 5 -to10-year measures of inflation compensation based on Treasury Inflation Protected Securities rose above their pre -pandemic levels.
" Financing conditions in capital markets continued to be broadly accommodative, supported by low interest rates and high equity valuations."
" CRE bank loan growth in October and November rema ined weak, consistent with tig htened bank lending standards."
" Staff Economic Outlook  In the U.S. economic projection prepared by the staff for the December FOMC meeting, real GDP growth was revised up and the unemployment rate revised down  for the fourth quarter  relative to the November meeting forecast."
" These revisions reflected incoming data that were, on balance, better than expected, although the recent resurgence of the pandemic and increased social -distancing restrictions in many states and localities were expected to weigh on economic activity in the coming months."
" As a result, the staff expected that real GDP growth would temporarily weaken in the first quarter of 2021, and the slowing seen in some of the most recent Page 6Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________   highfrequency indicators of spending and employment appeared consistent with that forecast."
" The inflation forecast for the rest of 2020 was revised down slightly in response to incoming data, and inflation was proj ected to finish the year at a relatively subdued level, reflecting substantial margins of labor - and productmarket slack in the economy and the large declines in consumer energy prices seen earlier in 2020."
" Primarily in response to the recent favorable news on the development of COVID19 vaccine s, the staff revised up its projection of real GDP growth for 2021 as a whole, as social -distancing measures were expected to ease more quickly than previously assumed."
" With monetary policy assumed to remain highly accommodative, the staff continued to project that real GDP growth over the medium term would be well above the rate of potential output growth, leading to a considerable further decline in the unemployment rate."
" The resulting takeup of labor - and product -market slack was expected to lead to gradually increasing inflation, and, for some time in the years beyond 2023, inflation was projected to overshoot 2  percent by a moderate amount, as monetary policy remained accommodative."
" Participants ’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook  In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2020 through 2023 and over the longer run, based on their individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy, including the path of the federal funds rate."
" The longer -run projections represented each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy."
 Economic activity and employment had continued to recover but remained well below their levels at the beginning of the year.
 Weaker demand and earlier declines in oil prices had been holding down consumer price inflation.
" Participants agreed that the path of the economy would depend on the course of the virus and that the ongoing public health crisis would continue to weigh on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term and posed considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term."
 They noted t hat the economic  recovery thus far had been stronger than anticipated —suggesting greater momentum in economic activity than had been previously thought— but viewed the more recent indicators as signal ing that the pace of recovery had slowed .
" Participants commented that the rebound in consumer spending  was due, in part, to fiscal programs such as federal stimulus payments and expanded unemployment benefits."
" A ccommodative monetary policy was viewed as having provided support to interest rate sensitive expenditure categories, including residential investment and consumer durables spending."
"  Various participants noted that low -income households were particul arly hard hit by the effects of the resurgent virus, and that—with the looming expiration of the expanded unemployment benefits, eviction moratoria, and loan forbearance programs —their situations could deteriorate significantly if additional relief and sup port did not materialize."
 A couple of participants  remarked that the very low levels of inventories  would likely be a factor supporting increases in production as demand continued to recover.
"Participants remarked that labor market conditions generally had continued to improve, but they were still a long way from those consistent with the Committee’s maximum employment goal ."
" Although the pace of employment gains had moderated in recent months , the overall recovery in employment thus far had been faster than anticipated, with a little more than half of the 22 million jobs lost over March and April having been regained ."
" The unemployment rate had declined further, although several participants  underlined the fact that the labor force participation rate remained below its pre -pandemic level —likely reflecting, in part, health concerns and additional childcare responsibilities associated with online schooling."
" Participants assessed that the ongoing surge in COVID -19 infections would be particularly challen ging for the labor market in coming months, but they indicated that they expected employment to continue to recover over the medium term."
" In light of these considerations, several participants  assessed that improvements in the labor market were lagging that of economic activity, and they indicated that they had not revised their projections of labor market variables to the same extent as their revision of the outlook for economic activity."
" In their comments about inflation, participants noted that increases in consumer prices had been soft of late, as prices of products in those categories most affected by social distancing —such as hotel accommodations and air travel —continued to be depressed and increases in rents remained low."
" However, participants generally saw these downward pressures on inflation starting to abate next year, with widespread distribution of vaccines reducing social -distancing concerns and spurring economic activity."
" A couple of participants  suggested that, as a result of  ongoing technologyenabled disr uption to business models and practices or lasting pandemic - induced restraint on firms’ pricing power , downward pressure on inflation could persist ."
 Several participants  noted a pickup in marketbased measures of inflation compensation.
" Participants expected that, with continued monetary policy support, inflation would rise over time."
" In their SEP submissions, seven participants —five more than in the September SEP —expected overall inflation to be  above the Committee’s 2 percent longer -run objective in 2023."
" The positive vaccine news was seen as reducing downside r isks over the medium term, and a number of  participants  saw risks to economic activity as more balanced than earlier."
" As upside risks, participants mentioned the prospect that the release of pentup demand , spurred by  wider -scale vaccinations and easing  of social distancing , could boost spending and bring individuals back to the labor force more quickly than currently expected as well as the possibility that fiscal policy developments could see measures that were larger than expected in amount or economic impact."
" Regarding inflation, participants generally viewed the ri sks as having become more balanced than they were earlier in the year, though most still viewed the risks as  being  weighted to the downside."
" As an upside risk to inflation, a few participants  noted the potential for a stronger -thanexpected recovery, coupled with the possible emergence of pandemic -related supply constraints , to boost inflation."
" In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, participants reaffirmed the Federal Reserve’s commitment to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy during this challenging time, thereby promoting the Committee’s statutory goals of maximum employment and  price stability."
" Participants agreed that the path of the economy would depend significantly on the course of the virus and that the ongoing public health crisis would continue to weigh on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term."
" In light of this assessment, all participants judged that maintaining an accommodative stance of monetary policy was essential to foster economic recovery and to achieve an average inflation rate of  2 percent over time."
"All participants supported enhancing the Committee’s guidance on asset purchases at this meeting and, in particular, adopting qualitative, outcome -based guidance indicating that increases in asset holdings would continue, with purchases of  Treasury securities of at least $80 billion per  month and of agency MBS of at least $40 billion per month, until substantial further progress has been made toward reaching the Committee’s maximum employment and price stability goals."
" For example, if progress toward the Committee’s goals proved slower than anticipated, the new guidance relayed  the Committee’s intention to respond by increasing  monetary policy accommodation through  maintaining the current level of the target range of the federal funds rate for longer and raising the expected path of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet."
A number of participants discussed considerations related to determining the eventual attainment of “substantial further progress” toward  reaching the Committee’s maximum employment and price stability goals.
Participants shared their views on the appropriate evolution of asset purchases once substantial further progress had been made toward the Committee’s maximum employment and price stability goals.

 Members expected to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until those outcomes were achieved.
" All members agreed to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent, and they expected that it would be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions had reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessments of maximum employment and inflation had risen to 2  percent and was on track to moderately exceed 2  percent for some time."
" In addition, members agreed that it would be appropriate for the Federal Reserve to continue to increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and agency MBS by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress had been made toward the Committee’ s maximum employment and price stability goals."
" Members agreed that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and that they would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate in the event that risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals."

 The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2  percent over the longer run.
" With inflation running persistently below this longer -run goal, the Committee will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2  percent for some time so that inflation the Committee unanimously approved a corrected version of the statement for release at 2:00  p.m. Minutes of the Meeting of December 15–16, 2020Page 11_____________________________________________________________________________________________   averages 2  percent over time and longer -term inflation expectations remain well anchored  at 2 percent."
 The Committee expects to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomes are achieved.
 The Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼  percent and expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2  percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2  percent for some time.
