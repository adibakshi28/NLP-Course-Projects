" The market -implied path of the policy rate rose, with the median federal funds rate values  in the September Summary of Economic Projections  and other Federal Reserve communications  being  viewed  by market participants  as indicating a commitment to sustaining a restrictive monetary policy  stance."
" With data received over the period also indicating higher -thanexpected core inflation, market participants plac ed high odds on a 75  basis point increase  in the target range at the current meeting."
" Investment -grade bond yields and mortgage interest rates moved up as well, to the hig hest levels in many years."
" In the case of advanced economies, whose monetary policy tightening was well under  way, market participants focused on communications perceived as signaling a potentially slower pace of policy rate increases in the period ahead."
" Labor market conditions remained quite tight, and consumer price inflation— as measured by the 12month percent age change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) —remained elevated."
" In September, total nonfarm payroll employment posted a solid gain that was somewhat slower than the pace seen in recent months , and the unemployment rate declined 0.2 percent age point to 3.5  percent ."

" The labor force participation rate edged down in September , and the employmentto-population ratio was unchanged."
" Nominal wage growth continued to be rapid:  Average hourly earnings rose 5.0  percent  over the 12  months ending in September, while the employment cost index (ECI) of hourly compensation in the private sector, which also includes benefit costs, rose 5.2 percent  over this period."
 Consumer price inflation remained elevated.
" Total PCE price inflation was 6.2  percent over the 12  months ending in September, and core PCE inflation, which excludes changes in consumer energy prices and many consumer  food prices, was 5.1 percent  over the same period."
 The trimmed mean measure of 12 -month PCE price inflation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas was 4.7 percent  in September.
" The staff’s common inflation expectations index, which combines information from many indicators of inflation expectations and inflation compensation, was little changed in the third quarter but remained above prepandemic levels."
" Residential investment dropped further, however, and business fixed investment growth was held back by a decline in nonresidential structures investment."
 The nominal U.S. international  trade deficit narrowed in the third quarter.
" Net exports contributed positively to real GDP growth, as real exports stepped up while real imports declined."
" Data pointed to weakening foreign economic activity in recent months, weighed down by the economic  fallout of Russia’s war against Ukraine, headwinds in China, and tighter financial conditions."
" In many advanced foreign economies, high inflation and disruptions to energy supply contributed to a decline in real disposable incomes and depressed consumer and business confidence."
" In response, fiscal authorities in Europe and Japan announced packages intended to ease the burden of high inflation on consumers and businesses."
" In China, data indicated weaker momentum in economic activity and a further  deterio ration in the property market."
" Weaker global demand has also resulted in a pronounced slowdown in manufacturing, which weighed on activity in export- oriented emerging market economies in Asia."
" Consumer price inflation rose further in October in many foreign economies, reflecting past increases in energy and food prices, but also a continued broadening of inflationary pressure within core prices."
" In response to high inflation, many central banks further tightened monetary policy, albeit at a slower pace i n some cases."
" The expected path of the federal funds rate implied by a straight read of financial market quotes  rose notably over the intermeeting period, largely reflecting more -restrictive -thanexpected monetary policy communications and data releas es that pointed to inflation moving down more slowly than previously expected."
" The increases in nominal yields at medium - and longer -term horizons were primarily accounted for by hig her real yields, though inflation compensation measures rose as well."
" Broad equity  price indexes  fell significantly early in the intermeeting period, with inflation news and monetary policy expectations likely being the main drivers of stock price movements."
" In secured markets, money market rates remained soft relative to the ON RRP offering rate, attributed to subdued Treasury bill supply, elevated demand for Treasury collateral, and investor demand for very short -term assets amid uncertainty over the pace of policy rate increases."
 Foreign asset prices were volatile over the intermeeting period as investors grappled with the combination of a deteriorating global growth outlook and synchronous policy tightening undertaken by major central banks in response to high inflation.
" The U.S. dollar appreciated against most major currencies, driven by widening yield differentials between the United States and the rest of the world and further deterioration of the foreign growth outlook."
 The Chinese renminbi depreciated significantly against the dollar as continuation of the zeroCOVID policy and increased investor concerns about longer -term growth prospects weighed on the currency.
 Investors continued to withdraw from dedicated emerging market economy and European funds amid further increases in U.S.  Treasury yields and concerns over foreign economic growth.
" Bank interest rates for commercial and industrial (C&I ) loans continued the upward trend observed since the first quarter of 2022, while a rising proportion of small businesses reported facing increased borrowing costs in September."
" Interest rates on existing credit card accounts continued to trend upward, reflecting increases in the federal funds rate that were quickly passed through to prime rates."
" Credit continued to be generally available to businesses and households despite some signs of tightening lending standards in certain segments, but high borrowing costs reduced the demand for credit in many markets."
 Credit remained available in the residential mortgage market for borrowers who are able to pay high interest rates.
"  Amid this weaker outlook and higher interest rates, prices of risky assets generally fell, though real estate valuations remained elevated."
 Staff Economic Outlook  The projection for U.S. economic activity prepared by the staff for the November FOMC meeting was weaker than the September forecast.
" Broad financial conditions were ex pected to be considerably more restrictive over the projection period than in September, reflecting both recent market moves and upward revisions to the staff’s assumptions regarding the future course of monetary policy based on recent Federal Reserve communications."
" Likewise, the unemployment rate was expected to be above the staff’s estimate of its natural rate in 2024 and 2025."
" On a 12 -month change basis, total PCE price inflation was expected to be 5.3  percent in 2022 and core inflation was expected to be 4.6  percent."
" The staff raised their projection for core PCE price inflation in coming quarters, reflecting their assessment that the factors that had boosted inflation since the middle of last year —most notably, strong wage growth and the effect of supply constraints on prices —would persist for longer than previously thought."
" With the effects of supply– demand imbalances in goods markets expected to unwind and labor and product markets expected to become less tight, the staff continued to project that inflation would decline markedly over the next two years; in 2025, both total and core PCE price inflation were expected to be 2 percent ."
"With inflation remaining stubbornly high, the staff continued to view the risks to the inflation projection as skewed to the upside."
" For real activity, sluggish growth in real private domestic spending, a deteriorating global outlook, and  tightening financial conditions were all seen as salient downside risks to the projection for real activity; in addition, the possibility that a persistent reduction in inflation could require a greater -thanassumed amount of tightening in financial conditions was seen as another downside risk."
" Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook  In their discussion of current economic conditions, participants noted that recent indicators pointed to modest growth of spending and production."
" Nonetheless, job gains had been robust in recent months,  and the unemployment rate had remained low."
" Inflation remained elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher food and energy prices, and broader price pressures."
 The war and related events were creating additional upward pressure on inflation and were weighing on global economic activity.
" Against this background, participants continued to be highly attentive to inflation risks."
"With regard to current economic activity and the near -term outlook, participants observed that although real GDP rebounded in the third quarter, recent data suggested that economic activity in the near  term appeared  likely to expand at  a pace below its trend  growth rate ."
" Participants noted a softening in consumer and business spending growth , and some participants remarked that Page 6Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ there had been a notable slowing in interest ratesensi-tive sectors, particularly housing, in response to the tightening of financial conditions associated with the Committee’s policy actions."
" With inflation remaining far too high and showing few signs of moderating, participants  observed that a period of below -trend real GDP growth would be helpful  in bringing  aggregate supply and aggregate demand into better balance, reduc ing inflationary pressures , and setting  the stage for the sustained achievement of the Committee’s objectives of maximum employment and price stability."
" In their discussion of the household sector, participants noted that growth in consumer spending had softened  recently."
 Participants commented  that higher mortgage interest rates had notably restrained housing activity.
"With regard to the business sector, participants noted that growth in investment spending was modest."
"Participants observed that, with inflation elevated globally, many central banks were tightening monetary policy simultaneously, contributing to an overall tightening of global financial conditions ."
" Participants further noted that the overall tightening of global financial conditions, along with energy prices and other headwinds, was contributing to a slowdown in the growth rate of global real GDP."
"Participants observed that the labor market had remained very tight, with the unemployment rate near  a historically low level, the number of job vacancies very high, a low pace of layoffs, robust employment gains, and elevated nominal wage growth."
" Participants commented on the labor market having remained strong to date, even alongside the slowing in economic activity."
 T hese participants noted that t his consideration had limited layoffs even as the broader economy had softened or that this behavior could limit layoffs if aggregate economic activity  were to soften further .
" Nevertheles s, many participants noted tentative signs that the labor market might be moving slowly  toward a better balance of supply and demand ; these signs included a lower rate of job turnover and a moderation in nominal wage growth."
" Participants anticipated that imbalances in the labor market would gradually diminish and that the unemployment rate would likely rise somewhat from its current very low level , while  vacancies would likely fall."
Participants agreed that inflation was unacceptably high and was well above the Committee’s longer -run goal of 2 percent .
" Some participants noted that the burden of high inflation was falling disproportionally on low -income households, for whom necessities like food, energy, and shelter make up a larger share of expenditures ."
" Some participants noted that the recent high pace of nominal wage growth, taken together  with the recent  low pace of productivity growth , would, if sustained,  be inconsistent with achievement of the 2  percent  inflation  objective."
" Several participants , however,  commented on signs of a moderation in nom_____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of November 1–2, 2022Page 7 inal wage growth."
" Participants agreed that near -term inflation pressures were high, but some noted that lower commodity prices or the expected reduced  pressure on goods prices  due to an easing of  supply constraint s should  contribute to lower  inflation in the medium term."
" Several participants remarked that rent increases on  new leases  had been slowing in recent months, but participants also noted that it would take some time for this development to show up in  PCE inflation."
" Participants remarked that,  overall, measures of medium - and longer -term inflation expectations obtained from surveys of households and businesses as well as from financial markets quotes appear ed to have remained well anchored."
 A couple of participants observed that longer -term inflation expectations were stable even as measures of near -term inflation expectations responded to realized inflation in line with hist orical patterns .
 Participants noted that longer -term inflation expectations were an important influence on inflation ’s behavior and stressed that the Committee’s ongoing monetary policy tightening would be essential for ensuring that these expectations remained well anchored.
" Several participants expressed the concern that the longer inflation remained well above the 2  percent goal, the greater the risk that longer -term inflation expectations could become unanchored."
" Such a development , if it materialized, would make it much more costly to bring inflation down and to achieve the Committee’s statutory objectives of maximum employment and price stability."
 A couple of participants discussed the high dispersion of longer -term inflation expectations across respondents in various surveys:  These participants  noted that the higher dispersion may signal increased  uncertainty about the inflation outlook and w as a reason not to be complacent about longer -term inflation expectations remaining well anchored.
" Participants discussed the length of the lags  in the response of the economy to monetary policy actions , taking into account historical experience  and the various estimates of timing relationships  provided in economic research, as well as the high degree of uncertainty involved in applying the evidence on lags to the current situation."
" They noted  that monetary policy tightening typically produced  rapid  effects on financial conditions but that  the full effects of changes in financial conditions on aggregate spending and the labor market, and then on inflation, likely took longer to materialize."
" With regard to  current circumstances, many participants remarked that, even though  the tightening of monetary policy had clearly influenced financial conditions and had had notable effects in some interest rate -sensitive sectors,  the timing of the  effect s on overall economic activity, the labor market, and inflation was still quite uncertain, with the full extent of the effects yet to be realized ."
" Several participants observed that , because of the difficulties in isolating the effects of monetary policy, changes in economic structure, or increasing transparency over time regarding  monetary policy decisions, the historical record did not provide definitive evidence on  the length of these lags ."
Participants  generally noted  that the uncertainty associated with their economic outlooks was high and that the risks to the inflation outlook remained tilted to the upside.
 Participants observed that recent inflation had been higher and more persistent than anticipated.
"A number of participants judged that the risks regarding the outlook for economic activity were weighted to the downside, with various global headwinds being prominently cited."
 These global headwinds included a slowdown in economic activity occurring in China and the ongoing international economic implications of Russia’ s war against Ukraine.
" Participants observed that, because of high inflation pressures prevailing globally, monetary policy tightening was under  way in many other economies—a development likely to affect foreign economic activity and carrying the potential for spillovers to the U.S. economy."
" In their discussion of issues related to financial stability, participants noted the importance of orderly functioning of the market for U.S. Treasury securities for the transmission of monetary policy,  for meeting the financing needs of the federal government, and for the operation of the global financial system."
" Participants observed  that, despite elevated interest rate volatility and indications of strained liquidity conditions , the functioning of  the Tre asury securities market had been orderly."
" A few participants noted the importance of being prepared to address disruptions in U.S. core market functioning in ways that would not affect the stance of monetary policy, especially during episodes  of monetary policy tightening ."
 Several participants noted the risks posed by nonbank financial institutions amid the rapid global tightening of monetary policy and the potential for hidden leverage in these institutions to amplify shocks .
"In their consideration of appropriate monetary policy actions at this meeting, participants concurred that inflation remained well above the Committee’s longer -run goal of 2  percent and the recent data on inflation provided very few signs that inflation pressures were abating."
" The economic expansion had slowed significantly from last year’s rapid pace, and recent indicators pointed to modest growth in spending and production in the current quarter."
" Despite the slowdown in growth, the labor market remained extremely tight, and nominal  wage growth remained elevated."
 P articipants  observed that the policy rate hike at this meeting was another step toward making the Committee’s monetary policy stance sufficiently restrictive to help ease supply and demand imbalances and to return inflation to 2 percent over time.
"In their discussion of the effects of monetary policy actions and communications to date, participants concurred that the Committee had taken forceful steps to moderate aggregate demand in order to bring it  into better alignment with aggregate supply."
 Several participants commented that monetary policy actions and communications had helped keep longer -term inflation expectations well anchored —a situation that would help facilitate the return of inflation to the Committee’s longer -run goal of 2  percent .
" Nevertheless, with realized inflation well above that goal and  the labor market still very tight, participants agreed that ongoing increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would be appropriate and would help keep longer -term inflation expectations well anchored."
" Participants noted that, with regard to both real economic activity and inflation,  it would take time for the full effects of monetary restraint to be realized  and that these lags complicated an assessment of the effects of monetary policy."
" In discussing potential policy actions at upcoming meetings, participants reaffirmed their strong commitment to returning inflation to the Committee’s 2 percent  objective, and they  continued to anticipate that ongoing increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would be appropriate in order to attain a sufficiently restrictive stance of policy to bring inflation down over time."
" Even so , various  participants noted that, with inflation showing little sign thus far of abating, and with supply and demand imbalances in the economy persisting, their assessment of the ultimate level of the federal funds rate that would be necessary to achieve the Committee’s goals was somewhat higher than the y had previously expected ."
" These considerations included the cumulative tightening of monetary policy to date, the lags between monetary policy actions and the behavior of economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments."
"  A number of participants observed  that, as monetary policy approached  a stance that was sufficiently restrictive to achieve the Committee’s goals , it would become appropriate to slow the pace of increase in the target range for the federal funds rate."
 A slower  pace in these circumstances  would better allow the Committee to assess progress toward its goals of maximum employment and price stability.
  The uncertain lags and magnitudes associated with the effe cts of monetary policy actions on economic activity and inflation were among the reasons cited regarding why such an assessment  was important.
" A few other participants noted that, before slowing the pace of policy rate increases, it could be advantageous to wait until the stance of policy was more clearly in restrictive territory and there were more concrete signs that inflation pressures were receding  significantly ."
"With monetary policy approaching a sufficiently restrictive stance, participants emphasized that the level to which the Committee ultimately raised the target range for the federal funds rate, and the evolution of the policy stance thereafter , had become more important considerations for achieving the Committee’s goals than the pace of further increase s in the target range."
 Participants agreed that communicating this distinction to the public was important in order to reinforce the Committee’s strong commit ment to returning inflation to the 2 percent objective.
 Participants  discussed a number of riskmanagement considerations related to the conduct of monetary policy.
" In light of the continuing  broad -based and unacceptably high level of inflation and upside risks to the inflation outlook, participants remarked that purposefully moving to a more restrictive policy stance was consistent with risk -management considerations."
 Some participants observed that there had been  an increase in the risk that the cumulative policy restraint  would exceed what was required to bring inflation back to 2  percent .
" There was wide agreement that heightened uncertainty regarding the outlooks for both inflation and real activity underscored the importance of taking into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags  with which monetary policy affected economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments ."
