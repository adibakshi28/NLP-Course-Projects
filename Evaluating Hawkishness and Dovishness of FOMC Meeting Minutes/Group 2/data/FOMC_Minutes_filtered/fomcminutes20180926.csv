" Under the baseline path for interest rates, the Federal Reserve’s reinvestments of principal payments  on agency mortgage -backed securities would likely fall to zero beginning in October; however, prepayments could rise somewhat above the redemption cap in some  months in the future given the uncertainties surrounding prepayment projections ."
" The flooding and damage from Hurricane Florence, w hich ma de landfall on September 14, seemed likely to have a modest, transitory effect on national economic growth in the second half of the year."
" Consumer price inflation, as measured by the 12month percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), remained near2 percent in July."
" Survey -based measures of longer -runinflation expectations were little changed on balance.Total nonfarm payroll employment increased at a strong pace, on average, in July and August."
" The national unemployment rate decreased to 3.9  percent in July and remained at that level in August, while the labor force participation rate and the employmentto-population ratio moved down somewhat, on balance, over those two months."
" The unemployment rates for Afr ican Americans, Asians, and Hispanics in August were below their levels at the end of the previous expansion."
" The rate of private -sector job openings continued to be elevated in June and July, while the rate of quits moved higher on balance; initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits were at a historically low level in mid -September."
 The staff’s preliminary assessment was that the consequences of Hurricane Florence would have a slight negative effect on aggregate real PCE growth in the third quarter but that spending would bounce back in the fourth quarter.
" More broadly, recent readings on key factors that influence consumer spending—including gains in employment, real disposable personal income, and households’ net worth—con tinued to be supportive of solid real PCE growth in the near term."
 Growth in real private expenditures for business equipment and intellectual property appeared to be moderating a little in the third quarter following strong gains in expenditures in the first half of the year.
" The nominal U.S. international trade deficit widened in June and July, with declining exports and rising imports."
 The available data suggested that the change in net exports would be a notable drag on real GDP growth in the third quarter.
" Core PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in consumer food and energy prices, was 2.0 percent over that same period."
" The consumer price index (CPI) rose 2.7 percent over the 12 months ending in August, while core CPI inflation was 2.2  percent."
" Recent readings on survey -based measures of longer -run inflation expectations —including those from the Michigan survey, the Survey of Professional Forecasters, and the Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers and Sur vey of Market Participants —were little changed on balance."
" Foreign economic growth slowed in the second quarter , as a pickup in growth for the advanced foreign economies (AFEs) was more than offset by slower growth in the EMEs.  Incoming indicators for the AFEs pointed to some moderation in the pace of growth in the third quarter, especially for Canada and Japan, wh ile indicators for the EMEs suggested a pickup in many countries from the unusually slow pace of the second quarter."
" Foreign inflation had risen a bit recently, boosted by higher oil prices and, in the EMEs, higher food prices and recent currency deprecia tion."
 Financing conditions for nonfinancial businesses and households remained supportive of economic activity on balance.
" FOMC communications elicit ed limited price reactions in financial markets over the intermeeting period, and market -implied measures of monetary policy expectations were little changed."
" However, domestic economic data releases came in a bit above market expectations, on net, with the stronger -thanexpected average hourly earnings in the August employment report notably boosting Treasury yields."
 Measures of inflation compensation derived from Treasury InflationProtected Securities over the Page 4Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________     next 5 years ticked up and were little changed 5 to 10 years ahead.
" Demand for corporate borrowing appeared to have declined, in part because of strong earnings, rising interest rates, and seasonal factors."
" In July and August, gross issuance of corporate bonds was relatively weak, while commercial and industrial loan growth moderated."
" Financing conditions for small businesses remained favorable, and survey -based measures of credit demand among small business owners showed signs of strengthening, althoug h demand was still weak relative to pre -crisis levels."
" Al though  CRE loan growth at banks moderated in July and August, issuance of commercial mortgage -backed securities (CMBS) was robust."
" Refinancing activity continued to be muted in recent months, and the growth in purchase mortgage originations slowed a bit relative to year -earlier levels, in part reflecting the notable increase in mortgage rates earlier this year."
" On net, financing conditions in consumer credit markets were little changed in recent months and remained largely supportive of growth in household spending."
" More broadly, al -though interest rates for credit cards and auto loans continued to rise, consumer credit expanded at a solid pace."
 The staff’s preliminary assessment was that the effects of Hurricane Florence would lead to a slight reduction in  real GDP growth in the third quarter and a small addition to growth in the fourth quarter as economic activity returned to more normal levels and some disrupted activity was made up.
" Over the 2018 –20 period, output was projected to rise at a rate above o r at the staff’s estimate of potential growth and then slow to a pace below it in 2021."
 The unemployment rate was projected to decline further below the staff’s estimate of its longer -run natural rate but to bottom out in 2020 and begin to edge up in 2021.
" Relative to the forecast prepared for the previous meeting, the projection for real GDP growth this year was revised up a little, primarily in response to stronger -thanexpected incoming data on household spending and business investment."
" The projection for the medium term was not materially changed, in part because the recently enacted tariffs on Chinese goods and the retaliatory actions of China were judged to have only a small net effect on U.S. real GDP growth over the next few years."
" In addition, the staff continued to anticipate that supply constraints might restrain output growth somewhat in the medium term."
" The unemployment rate was projected to be a little lower over the medium term than in the previous forecast, partly in response to the staff’s assessment that the natural rate of unemployment was a bit lower than previously assumed."
" With labor market conditions already tight, t he staff continued to Minutes of the Meeting of September 25–26, 2018Page 5_____________________________________________________________________________________________     assume that projected employment gains  would manifest in smaller -thanusual downward pressure on the  unemployment rate and in larger -thanusual upward pressure  on the  labor force participation rate."
" The staff forecast for total PCE price inflation in 2018 was revised up slightly, mainly because of a faster -thanexpected increase in consumer energy prices in the second half."
 The staff continued to project that total PCE inflation would remain near the Committee’s 2 percent objective over the medium term and that core PCE price inflation would run slightly higher than total inflation over that period because of a projected decline in consumer energy prices in 2019 through 2021.
" The staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as similar to the average of the past 20 years."
 The  staff also saw the risks to the forecasts for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate as balanced.
" On the downside, trade policies and foreign economic developments could move in directions that have significant negative effects on U.S. economic growth."
 Risks to the inflation projection also were seen as balanced.
 The upside risk that inflation c ould increase more than expected in an economy that was projected to move further above its potential was counterbalanced by the downside risk that longer -term inflation expectations may be lower than was assumed in the staff forecast.
" Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook  In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, members of the Board of Governors and Federal Reserve Bank presidents submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2018 through 2 021 and over the longer run, based on their individual assessments of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate."
" The longer -run projections represented each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, o ver time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy."
" In their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants agreed that information received since the FOMC met in August indicated that the labor market continued to strengthen and that economic activity rose at a strong rate."
" Job gains were strong, on average, in r ecent months, and the unemployment rate stayed low."
" On a 12 -month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy remained near 2 percent."
 Indicators of longer -term inflation expectations were little changed on balance.
" Despite the magnitude of the storm - related destruction, participants expected the imprint on the level of overall economic activity at the national level to be relatively modest, consistent with the experience following several previous major storms ."
"Based on recent readings on spending, employment, and inflation, almost all participants saw little change in their assessment of the economic outlook, although  a few of them judged that recent data pointed to a pace of economic activity that was stronger than they had expected earlier this yea r."
" Participants noted a number of favorable economic factors that were supporting above -trend GDP growth; these included strong labor market conditions, stimulative federal tax and spending policies, accommodative financial conditions, solid household balance sheets, and continued high levels of household and business confidence."
 A couple of participants commented that recent strong growth in GDP may also be due in part to increases in the growth rate of the economy’s productive capacity.
" In their discussion of the household sector, participants generally characterized consumption growth as strong, and they judged that robust increases in disposable income, high levels of consumer confidence, and solid household balance sheets had contributed to the strength in spending."
 Several participants noted that the household saving rate had been revised up signific antly in the most recent estimates published by the Bureau of Economic Activity.
" However, a couple of participants noted that the higher saving rate may not be a precursor to higher future consumption growth."
" For example, the higher saving rate  may indicate some greater caution on the part of consumers , greater inequality of income and Page 6Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________     wealth —which would imply a lower aggregate propensity to spend —or changing consumer behavior in a low interest rate environment ."
" With regard to residential investment, a few participants noted weak residential construction activity at the national or District level, which was attributed in part to higher interest rates or supply constraints."
" For the economy overall, participants generally agreed that, on  balance, recent data suggested some acceleration in labor costs, but that wage growth remained moderate by historical standards, which was due in part to tepid productivity growth."
" Regarding inflation, participants noted that on a  12month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy remained near 2 percent."
 Indicators of longer -term inflation expectations were little changed on balance.
" In general, participants viewed recent consumer price developments as consistent with their expectation that inflation was on a trajectory to achieve the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective on a sustained basis."
 Several participants commented that inflation may modestly exceed 2 percent for a period of time.
 Reports from business contacts and surveys in a number of Districts also indicated some firming in inflationary pressures.
" In particular,  some contacts indicated that input prices had been bolstered by strong demand or import tariffs."
"  A couple of participants emphasized that because inflation had run below the C ommittee’s 2 percent objective for the past several years, some measures of trend inflation or longer -term inflation expectations were below levels consistent with the 2 percent objective; these participants judged that a modest increase in inflation expectations would be important for achieving the inflation objective on a sustained basis."
" Some participants commented about the continued growth in levera ged loans, the loosening of terms and standards on these loans, or the growth of this activity in the nonbank sector as reasons to remain mindful of vulnerabilities and possible risks to financial stability."
" Participants commented on a number of risks  and uncertainties associated with their  outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation over the medium term."
 Some participants commented that trade policy developments remained a source of uncert ainty for the outlook for domestic growth and inflation.
 The divergence between domestic and foreign economic growth prospects and monetary policies was cited as presenting a downside risk because of the potential for further strengthening of the U.S. dollar; some participants noted that financial stresses in a few EMEs could pose additional risks if they were to spread  more broadly through the global economy and financial markets.
" Tightening resource utilization and an increasing ability of firms to raise output prices were c ited as factors that could lead to higher -thanexpected inflation, while lower -thanexpected growth, a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, or Minutes of the Meeting of September 25–26, 2018Page 7_____________________________________________________________________________________________     inflation expectations persistently running below  2 percent were mentioned as risks that could lead to lower inflation."
A few participants offered perspectives on the term structure of interest rates and what a potential inversion of the yield curve might signal about economic prospects in light of the historical regularity that an inverted yield curve has often preceded the onset of recessions in the United States.
" On the one hand, an inverted yield curve could indicate  an increased risk of recession; on the other hand, the low level of term premiums in recent years —reflecting, in part, central bank asset purchases —could t emper the reliability of the slope of the yield curve as an indicator of future economic activity."
" In addition, the recent rise and possible further increases in longer -term interest rates might diminish the likelihood that the yield curve would invert in  the near term."
" In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, participants generally judged that the economy was evolving about as anticipated, with real economic activity rising at a strong rate, labor market conditions continuing to str engthen, and inflation near the Committee’s objective."
 Almost all considered that it was also appropriate to revise the Committee’s postmeeting statement in order to remove the language stating that “the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative.
" With regard to the outlook for monetary policy  beyond this meeting , particip ants generally anticipated that further gradual increas es in the target range for the federal funds rate would most likely be consistent with a sustained economic expansion, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near 2 percent over the medium term."
" This gradual approach would balance the risk of tightening monetary policy too quickly, which could lead to an abrupt slowing in the economy and inflation moving below the Committee’s objective, against the risk of moving too slowly, which could engender  inflation persistently above the objective and possibly contribute to a buildup of financial imbalances."
 Participants offered their views about how much additional policy firming would likely be required for the Committee to sustainably achieve its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.
 A few participants expected that policy would need to become modestly restrictive for a time and a  number judged that it would be necessary to temporarily raise the federal funds rat e above their assessments of its longer -run level  in order to reduc e the risk of a sustained overshooting of the Committee’s 2 percent inflation objective  or the risk posed by significant financial imbalances.
 A couple of participants indicated that they would not favor adopting a restrictive  policy stance in the absence of clear signs of an overheating economy and rising inflation.
" Building on comments expressed at previous meetings, a couple of participants indicated that it would be desirable to assess the Committee’s strategic approach to the conduct of policy and to hold a periodic and systematic review of the strengths and weaknesses of the Committee’s monetary policy framework."
" Committee Policy Action  In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that information received since the Committee met in August indicated t hat the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising at a strong rate."
" Job gains had been strong, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate had stayed low."
" On a 12month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy remained near 2 percent."
 Indicators of longer -term inflation expectations were little changed on balance.
" Consequently, members expected that further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would be consistent with sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective over the medium term."
" After assessing current conditions  and the outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, members voted to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 2 to 2¼ percent."
 Members agreed that the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the feder al funds rate would depend on their assessment of realized and expected economic conditions relative to the Committee’s maximum -employment objective and symmetric 2 percent inflation objective.
" They reiterated that this assessment would take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
" With regard to the postmeeting statement, members agreed to remove the sentence indicating that “the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative.”  Members made various  points regarding the removal of the sentence from the statement."
 The Committee also directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve’s agency mortgage -backed securities transactions.”  The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00  p.m.: “Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in August indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising at a strong rate.
" Job gains have been strong, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has st ayed low."
" On a 12 -month basis, both overall inflation and Minutes of the Meeting of September 25–26, 2018Page 9_____________________________________________________________________________________________     inflation for items other than food and energy remain near 2  percent."
" Indicators of longer -term inflation expectations are li ttle changed, on balance."
" Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
" The Committee expects that further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be consistent w ith sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee’s symmetric 2  percent objective over the medium term."
" In view of realized and expected la bor market conditions and inflation, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 2  to 2¼ percent."
" In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2  percent inflation objective."
" This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.”  Voting for this action:  Jerome H."
" To support the Committee’s decision to raise the target range for the federal funds rate, the Board of Governors voted unanimously to raise the interest rates on required and excess reserve balances to 2.20  percent, effective September  27, 2018."
" (Secretar y’s note:  Subsequently, the Federal Reserve Bank s of New York and Minneapolis were  informed by the Secretary of the Board of the Board’s approval of their establishment of a primary credit rate of 2.75  percent, effective September  27, 2018.)  The second vote of the Board also encompassed approval of the establishment of the interest rates for secondary and seasonal credit under the existing formulas for computing such rates."
"   Page 10Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________    Summary of Economic Projections   In conjunction with the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting held on September 25– 26, 2018, meeting participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real gross domestic product (GDP) growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2018 to 2021 and over the longer run.1  Each participant’s projections were based on information available at the time of the meeting, together with his or her assessment of appropriate monetar y policy —including a path for the federal funds rate and its longer -run value —and assumptions about other factors likely to affect economic outcomes."
" The longer -run projections represent each participant’s assessment of the value to which each variable wo uld be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy.2  “Appropriate monetary policy” is defined as the future path of policy that each participant deems most likely to foster outcomes for economic activity and inflation that best satisfy his or her individual interpretation of the statutory mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability."
" All participants who submitted longer -run projections expected that, in 2018, real GDP would expand at a pace exceeding their individual estimates of the longer -run growth rate of real GDP."
" All participants anticipated that real GDP growth would moderate in the coming years, and a majority of participants projected growth in 2021 to be below their estimates of the longer -run rate."
 All participants who submitted longer -run projections expected that the unemployment rate would run below their estimates of its longer -run level throughout the projection period.
" Participants generally proje cted that inflation, as measured by the four -quarter percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), would be at or near the Committee’s 2 percent objective at the end of 2018 and would continue at close to that rate throu gh 2021."
" Compared with the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) from June, a solid majority of participants marked up their projections of real GDP growth and most increased their forecast of the unemployment rate in 2018, with                                                  1 Four members of the Board of Governors, one more than in June 2018, were in office at the time of the September 2018 meeting and submitted economic projections ."
 Participants’ projections of inflation were largely unchanged from June.
" As shown in figure 2, almost all participants continued to expect that the evolution of the economy, relative to their objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation, would likely warrant further gradual increases in the federal funds rate."
" Risks to their outlooks were viewed as balanced, although a couple more participants than in June saw risk s to their inflation projections as weighted to the upside."
"  The Outlook for Economic Activity  The medians of participants’ projections for the growth rate of real GDP, conditional on their individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy, were 3 .1 percent for 2018, 2.5 percent for 2019, and 2.0 percent for 2020."
" Participants’ projections for real GDP growth in 2021 were almost all below participants’ projections of growth in 2020 and, for a majority of participants, below their longer -run projections of real GDP growth."
" Some participants cited the waning of fiscal stimulus, less accommodative monetary policy, or anticipated appreciation of the dollar as factors contributing to their forecasts for a moderation of real GDP growth over the course of the projection period."
"2 One participant did not submit longer -run projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, or the federal funds rate."

Projections for the unemployment rate are for the average civilian unemployment rate in the fourthquarter of the year indicated.
Each participant’s projections are based on his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy.
Longerrun projections represent each participant’sassessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy.
"One participant did not submit longerrun projections for the change in real GDP, the unemployment rate, or the federal funds rate in conjunction with the June12–13, 2018, meeting, and one participant did not submit such projections in conjunction with the September 25–26, 2018, meeting.1.

"One participant did notsubmit longerrun projections for the federal funds rate.Page 4Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________    While most participants made slight upward revisions to their unemployment rate projections for this year, their projec tions in subsequent years and in the longer run were largely unchanged."
" A substantial majority of participants expected the unemployment rate to bottom out in 2019 or 2020 at levels below their estimates of the unemployment rate in the longer run, and the n to rise a little in 2021."
   Figures 3.A and 3.B show the distributions of participants’ projections for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate from 2018 to 2021 and over the longer run.
" The distribution of individual projections for real GDP growth for this year shifted noticeably to the right relative to that in the June SEP; the distribution for projected real GDP growth for 2019 also shifted to the right, albeit only a little."
" The distributions of individual projections for the unemployment r ate in 2018 and 2019 shifted up a little relative to the distributions in June, while the distributions of the projections for the unemployment rate in the longer run were largely unchanged."
"  The Outlook for Inflation  The medians of projections for to tal PCE price inflation were 2.1  percent in 2 018, 2 .0 percent in 2019, and 2.1 percent in 2020 and 2021."
" The medians of projections for co re PCE price inflation were 2.0  percent in 2018 and 2.1 percent in 2019, 2020, and 2021."
 Figures 3.C and 3.D provide information on the distributions of participants’ views about the outlook for inflation.
" Relative to the June SEP, a number of participants revised slightly down their projections for total PCE inflation this year and next."
 Most participants projected total PCE price inflation in the range of 1.9 to 2.0  percent for 2018 and 2019 and 2.1 to 2.2 percent in 2020 and 2021.
" Most participants projected that core PCE inflation would run at 1.9 to 2.0  percent in 2018 and at 2.1 to 2.2  percent in 2019, 2020, and 2021."
" Relative to the June SEP, a larger number of participants projected that core PCE inflation in 2019 and 2020 would fall in the 2.1 to 2.2  percent range."

" As described in the box “Forecast Uncertainty,” under certain assumptions, there is about a 70 percent probability that actual outcomes for real GDP, unemployment, consumer prices, and the federal funds rate will be in ranges implied by the average size of projection errors made in the past."
" This view was predicated on several factors, including a judgment that a gradual path of policy firming would appropriately balance the risk of a buildup of inflationary pressures or other imbalances associated with high levels of resource utilization, against the risk that factors such as diminishing fiscal stimulus and adverse developments in foreign economies could become a significant drag on real GDP growth."

" Participants’ assessments of the level of uncertainty surrounding their individual economic projections are shown in the bottom -left panels of figures  4.A, 4.B,  and 4.C.  Nearly all participants viewed the degree of uncertainty attached  to their economic projections  for real  GDP growth and inflation as broadly similar to the average of the past 20 years.3  A couple more participants than in June viewed the uncert ainty around the unemployment rate as higher than average."
" Participants’ assessments of the balance of risks to their economic projections are shown in the bottom -right panels of figures 4.A, 4.B, and 4.C.

"                                                  3 At the end of this summary, the box “Forecast Uncertainty” discusses the sources and interpretation of uncertainty surrounding the economic forecasts and explains the approach Those participants who did not judge the risks to their real GDP growth and unemployment rate projections as  balanced were roughly evenly split between those who viewed the risks as bei ng weighted to the upside and those who viewed the risks as being weighted to the downside ."
" Risks around both total and core inflation projections were judged to be broadly balanced by a solid majority of participants; however, thos e participants who saw the risks as uneven saw them as weighted to the upside."
"  In discussing the uncertainty and risks surrounding their economic projections, many participants pointed to upside risks to real GDP growth from fiscal stimulus or stronger -thanexpected effects of business optimism."
" Many participants also pointed to downside risks for the economy and inflation stemming from factors such as  trade policy, stresses  in emerging market economies , or stronger -thananticipated appreciation of the dollar."
" Because the Committee adjusts the federal funds rate in response to actual and prospective developments over time in real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation, uncertainty surrounding the projected path for the federal funds rate importantly reflects the uncertainties about  the paths for those key economic variables along with other factors."

"The conﬁdence interval is not strictly consistent with theprojections for the federal funds rate, primarily because these projections are not forecasts of the likeliest outcomes forthe federal funds rate, but rather projections of participants’ individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy.Still, historical forecast errors provide a broad sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rategenerated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policythat may be appropriate to oﬀset the eﬀects of shocks to the economy.The conﬁdence interval is assumed to be symmetric except when it is truncated at zero—the bottom of the lowesttarget range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted in the past by the Committee."
This truncation wouldnot be intended to indicate the likelihood of the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary policyaccommodation if doing so was judged appropriate.
"Because currentconditions may diﬀer from those that prevailed, on average, over the previous 20 years, the width and shape of theconﬁdence interval estimated on the basis of the historical forecast errors may not reﬂect FOMC participants’ currentassessments of the uncertainty and risks around their projections.* The conﬁdence interval is derived from forecasts of the average level of shortterm interest rates in the fourthquarter of the year indicated; more information about these data is available in table 2."
"The shaded area encompassesless than a 70 percent conﬁdence interval if the conﬁdence interval has been truncated at zero.Summary of Economic Projections of the Meeting of September 25–26, 2018Page 15_____________________________________________________________________________________________      Forecast Uncertainty The economic projections provided  by the members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks inform discussions of monetary policy among policymakers and can aid public understanding of the basis for policy actions."
" Thus, in setting the stance of monetary policy, participants consider not only what appears to be the most likely economic outcome as embodied in their projections, but also the range of alternative possibilities, the likelihood of their occu rring, and the potential costs to the economy should they occur."
" Table 2 summarizes the average historical accuracy of a range of forecasts, including those reported in past Monetary Policy Report s and those prepared by the Federal Reserve Board’s staff in  advance of meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)."
" The corresponding 70  percent confidence intervals for overall inflation would be 1.2 to 2.8  percent in the current year, 1.0 to 3.0 percent in the second year, and 0.9 to 3.1  percent in the third and fourth yea rs."
" Figures 4.A through 4.C illustrate these confidence bounds in “fan charts” that are symmetric and centered on the medians of FOMC participants’ projections for GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation."
" In particular, the unemployment rate cannot be negative; furthermore, the risks around a particular projection might be tilted to either the upside or the downside, in which case the corresponding fan chart would  be asymmetrically positioned around the median projection."
" These judgments are summarized in the lower -right panels of figures 4.A through 4.C.  As with real activity and inflation, the outlook for the future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable uncertainty."
 This uncertainty arises primarily because each participant ’s assessment of the appropriate stance of monetary policy depends importantly on the evolution of real activity and inflation over ti me.
 The final line in table  2 shows the error ranges for forecasts of short -term interest rates.
" It should be noted, however, that these confidence intervals are not strictly consistent with the projections for the federa l funds rate, as these projections are not forecasts of the most likely quarterly outcomes but rather are projections of participants’ individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy and are on an end -ofyear basis."
" However, the forecast errors shou ld provide a sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy that would be appropriate to offset the effects of shocks to the economy."
 This approach to the construction of the federal funds rate fan chart would be merely a convention; it would not have any implications for possible future policy decisions re garding the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so were appropriate.
