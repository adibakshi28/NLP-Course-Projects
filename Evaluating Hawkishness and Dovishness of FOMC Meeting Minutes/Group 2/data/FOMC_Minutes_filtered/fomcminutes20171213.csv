" Market participants cited a range of factors as contributing to this narrowing, including the gradual firming in the stance of monetary policy as well as an increa sing expectation among inves3 Attended Tuesday session only."
" The deputy manager also provided an update on plans for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, in conjunction with the Treasury’s Office of Financial Research, to begin publishing reference interest rates for repurchase agreements involving Treasury securities by the middle of next year."
" Total consumer price inflation, as measured by the 12month percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), remained below 2 percent in October and was lower than early in the year."
 Surveybased measures of longerrun inflation expectations were little changed on balance.
"Total nonfarm payroll employment increased strongly in October and November, likely reflecting in part a rebound from the negative effects of the hurricanes in September."
 The national unemployment rate declined to 4.1 percent in October and remained at that level in November.
" The unemployment rates for Hispanics, for Asians, and for whites were  lower in November than two months earlier, while the rate for African Americans was a little higher; the unemployment rates for each of these groups were close to the levels seen just before the most recent recession."
" The rates of privatesector job openings and quits were little changed at relatively high levels in Se ptember and October, and the fourweek moving average of initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits continued to be at a low level in early December."
" Recent readings on key factors that influence consumer spending—including gains in employment, real disposable personal income, and households’ net worth—continued to be supportive of moderate real PCE growth in the fourth quarter."
The nominal U.S. international trade deficit widened slightly in September and sharply in October.
 The available trade data suggested that the change in real net exports would make a neutral contribution to real U.S. GDP growth in the fourth quarter.
" Core PCE price inflation, which excludes ch anges in consumer food and energy prices, was nearly 1½ percent over that same period."
" The consumer price index (CPI) rose 2¼ percent over the 12 months ending in November, while core CPI inflation was 1¾ percent."
" Recent readings on surveybased measures of longerrun inflation expectations—including those from the Michigan survey, the Survey of Professional Forecasters, and the Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants—were little changed on balance."
Economic activity expanded at a solid pace in most foreign economies in the third qua rter.
" In several advanced foreign economies (AFEs), economic growth slowed but remained firm."
" Economic activity in the emerging market economies (EMEs) cont inued to grow briskly for the most part, especially in Asia."
" However, the Mexican economy contracted in the third quarter, as hurricanes and earthquakes disrupted economic activity."
" Despite a boost from recent increases in oil prices, inflation remained relatively subdued in  most AFEs and moderate in EMEs. Minutes of the Meeting of December 12–13, 2017Page 3_____________________________________________________________________________________________    Staff Review of the Financial Situation  Movements in domestic financial asset prices over the intermeeting period reflected slightly strongerthan- expected economic data releases, announcements related to Treasury debt issuance, and an increase in the perceived probability that th e Congress would enact tax legislation."
 Financing conditions for businesses and hous eholds remained broadly supportive of continued growth in household spending and business investment.
" Measures of inflation compensation based on Treasury InflationProtected Securities were little changed, on net, over the intermeeting period."
" Growth of bankintermediated credit to nonfinancial firms, however, was tepid."
" The growth of CRE loans held by the largest banks continued to slow, while CRE loan growth at smaller banks remained strong overall and even picked up a bit in October."
" Beyond 2017, the forecast for real GDP growth was revised up modest ly, reflecting the staff’s updated assumption that the reduction in federal income taxes expected to begin next year would be larger than assumed in the previous proj ection."
 The unemployment rate was projected to decline further over the next few years and to continue runnin g below the staff’s slightly downwardrevised estimate of the longerrun natural rate over this period.
"The staff’s forecast for total PCE price inflation was revised up a little for 2017, as somewhat higher forecasts for core PCE prices and for consumer energy prices were offset only partially by a lower forecast for consumer food prices."
" Total PCE price inflation in 2018 was projected to be about the same as in 2017, despite projected declines in consumer energy prices; core PCE prices were forecast to rise faster in 2018, reflecting the expected waning of transitory factors that held down those prices in 2017."
" Beyond  2018, the inflation forecast was little changed from the previous projection."
 The staff projected that inflation would be very close to the Committee’s 2 percent obje ctive in 2019 and at that objective in 2020.
"The staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as similar to the average of the past 20 years."
 The staff saw the risks to the forecasts for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate as balanced.
 The risks to the projection for inflation also were seen as balanced.
 Do wnside risks to inflation included the possibility that lo ngerterm inflation expectations may move lower or that the run of soft core inflation readings this year could prove to be more persistent than the staff expected.
 These downside risks were seen as essentially counte rbalanced by the upside risk that inflation could increase more than expected in an economy that was projected to move further above its potential.
"Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, members of the Board of Governors and Federal Reserve Bank presidents submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year  from 2017 through 2020 and over the longer run, based on their individual assessments of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate.4  The longerrun projections represented each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in  the absence of further shocks to the economy."
"In their discussion of economic conditions and the outlook, meeting participants agreed that information received since the FOMC met in  November indicated that economic activity had been rising at a solid rate and that the labor market had continued to strengthen."
" Averaging through fluctuations associated with the recent hurricanes, job gains had been solid and the unemployment rate had declined further."
" Household spending had been expanding at a moderate rate, and growth in business fixed investment had picked up in recent quarters."
" On a 12month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy had declined this year and were running below 2 percent."
" Marketbased measures of inflation compensation remained low;  surveybased measures of longerterm inflation expectations were little changed, on balance."
" One participant did not submit longerrun projections for real output growth, the unemployment rate, or the federal funds rate."
"Minutes of the Meeting of December 12–13, 2017Page 5_____________________________________________________________________________________________    Real economic activity appeared to be growing at a solid pace, buttressed by gains in consumer and business spending, supportive financial conditions, and an improving global economy."
" Participants judged that  hurricanerelated disruptions and rebuilding had affected economic activity, employment, and inflation in recent months but had not materially altered the outlook for the national economy."
 Th ey saw the incoming information on spending and the labor market as consistent with continued abovetrend growth and a further strengthening in labor market conditions.
" Consequently, participants continued to expect that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity would expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions would remain strong."
 Inflation on a 12month basis was expected to remain somewhat below 2 percent in the near term but to stabilize around the Committee’s 2 percent objective over the medium term.
" Nearterm risks to the economic outlook appeared to be roughly balanced, but participants agreed that it would be important to continue to monitor inflation developments closely."
"Participants expected moderate growth in consumer spending in the near term, underpinned by ongoing strength in the labor market, further improvements in households’ net worth, and buoyant consumer sentiment."
"District contacts were optimis tic, and their reports were generally consistent with co ntinued steady growth in business spending."
"Labor market conditions continued to strengthen in recent months, with the unemployment rate declining further and payroll gains well above a pace consistent with maintaining a stable unemployment rate over time."
" In several Districts, reports from business contacts or evidence from surveys pointed to some difficulty in finding qualified workers; in some cases, labor shortages were making it hard to fill customer demand or expand business."
" Overall, the pace of wage increases had generally been modest an d in line with inflation and productivity growth."
"PCE price inflation over the 12 months ending in October, at 1.6 percent, continued to run below the Committee’s longerrun objective of 2 percent; core PCE price inflation for items other than consumer food and energy prices was only 1.4 percent over the same period."
" It was noted that recent readings on monthly inflation had Page 6Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________    edged up, and a couple of participants observed that core inflation on a yearover-year basis appeared to be stabilizing."
 Many indicated that they expected cyclical pressures associated with a tightening labor market to show through to higher inflation over the medium term.
 These participants generally judged that much of the softness in core inflation this year reflected transitory factors and that inflation would begin to rise as the influence of these factors waned.
" However, one of them noted that secular trends, such as technological innovation or globalization, could be affecting competition and business pricing, and muting inflationary pressures."
" With core inflation readings having moved down this year and remaining well below 2 percent, some participants observed that there was a possibility that inflation might stay below the objective for longer than they currently expected."
" Several of them expressed concern that persistently weak inflation may have led to a decline in longerterm inflation expectations; they pointed to low marketbased measures of inflation compensation, declines in some survey measures of inflation expectations, or evidence from statistical models suggesting that the underlying trend in inflation had fallen in recent years."
" A few participants, however, noted that measures of inflation expectations had remained broadly stable this year despite the low readings on inflation and judged that this stability should support the return of inflation to the Committee’s 2 percent objective."
"With regard to financial markets, some participants observed that financial conditions remained accommodative, citing a range of indicators including low interest rates, narrow credit spreads, high equity values, a lower dollar, and some evidence of easier terms for lending to risky borrowers."
" A number of factors were seen as possibly contributing to the low levels of term premiums, including large holdings of longerterm assets by major central banks, persiste ntly low global inflation, and substantial global demand for assets with long durations."
"Meeting participants also di scussed the recent narrowing of the gap between the yields on longand shortmaturity nominal Treasury securities, which had resulted in a flatter profile of the term structure of interest rates."
" Among the factors contributing to the flattening, participants pointed to recent increa ses in the target range for the federal funds rate, reductio ns in investors’ estimates of the longerrun neutral real interest rate, lower longerterm inflation expectations, and lower term premiums."
"In their discussion of monetary policy, participants saw the outlook for economic activity and the labor market as having remained strong or having strengthened since their previous meeting, in part reflecting a modest boost from the expected passage of the tax legislation under consideration."
" Regarding inflation, participants generally viewed the mediumterm outlook as little changed, and a majority commented that they continued to expect inflation to gradually return  to the Committee’s 2 percent longerrun objective."
 A few participants again noted that transitory factors had likely held down inflation earlier this year.
" Howe ver, several participants observed that surveybased measures of inflation expectations or marketbased measures of inflation compensation remained low, or that other persistent factors may be holding down inflation, which would present challenges for the Committee in promoting a return of inflation to 2 percent over the medium term."
" These participants agreed that, even after an increase in the target range at this meeting, the stance of monetary policy would remain accommodative, supporting strong labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation."
" A couple of participants did not believe it was appropriate to raise the target  range for the federal funds rate at this meeting; these participants suggested that the Committee should maintain the target range at 1 to Minutes of the Meeting of December 12–13, 2017Page 7_____________________________________________________________________________________________    1¼ percent until the actual rate of inflation had moved  further toward the Committee’s 2 percent longerrun objective or inflation expectations had increased."
 They judged that leaving the target range at its current level would better support an increase in inflation expectations and thereby increase the likelihood that inflation will rise to 2 percent.
" Most participants reiterated their support for continuing a gradual approach to raising the target range, noting that this approach helped to balance risks to the outlook for economic activity and inflation."
" Participants discussed several risks that, if  realized, could necessitate a steeper path of increases in the target range; these risks included the possibility that inflation pressures could build unduly if output expanded well beyond its maximum sustainable level, perhaps owing to fiscal stimulus or accommodative financial market conditions."
" Participants also discussed risks that could lead to a flatter trajectory for the federal funds rate in the medium term, including a failure of actual or expected inflation to move up to the Committee’s 2 percent objective."
" While participants generally saw the risks to the economic outlook as roughly balanced, they agreed that inflation developments should be monitored closely."
" They expressed concern that such a path of increases in the policy rate, while gradual, might prove inconsistent with a sustained return of inflation to 2 percent, or that the level of the federal funds rate might already be near its current neutral value."
" They noted that financial conditions had not materially tightened since the removal of monetary policy accommodation began, that continued low interest rates risked financial instability in the futu re, or that the labor market was increasingly tight."
 A couple of participants noted the need to continue to monitor and evaluate the effects of balance sheet normalization on longterm interest rates and economic performance.
"Due to the persistent shortfall of inflation from the Committee’s 2 percent objective, or the risk that monetary policy could again become constrained by the zero lower bound, a few participants suggested that further study of potential alternative frameworks for the conduct of monetary policy such as pricelevel targeting or nominal GDP targeting could be useful."
"Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that information received since the Committee met in November indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising at a solid rate."
" Averaging through hurricanerelated fluctuations, job gains had been solid, and the unemployment rate had declined further."
" Household spending had been expanding at a moderate rate, and growth in business fixed investment had picked up in recent quarters."
" On a 12month basis, both overall inflation and in flation for items other than food and energy had declined for the year to date and were running below 2 percent."
" Marketbased measures of inflation compensation had remained low; surveybased measures of longerterm inflation expectations had changed little, on balance."
"Members acknowledged that hurricanerelated disruptions and rebuilding had affected economic activity, employment, and inflation in recent months but had not materially altered the outlook for the national economy."
" They continued to expect that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity would expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions would remain strong."
 Members expected inflation on a 12month basis to remain somewhat below 2 percent in the near term.
" They also expected inflation to stabilize around the Committee’s 2 percent objective over the medium term, but a couple of members expressed concern about whether inflation would return to 2 percent on a sustained basis in the medium term if the Committee increased the target range for the federal funds rate at the pace that is implied by the medians of the projections from the December SEP."
" Members saw the nearterm risks to the economic outlook as roughly balanced, but they agreed to monitor inflation developments closely."
"After assessing current conditions and the outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, nearly all members agreed to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 1¼ to 1½ percent."
" These members noted that the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting strong labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation."
" Two members preferred to leave the target range at 1 to 1¼ percent, suggesting that the Committee should wait to raise the target range until inflation moves up closer Page 8Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________    to 2 percent on a sustained basis or inflation expectations increase."
Members agreed that the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate would depend on their assessments of realized and expected economic conditions relative to the Committee’s objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.
" They noted that their assessments would take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and internationa l developments."
 Members agreed that their assessments would also take into account actual and expected in flation developments relative to the Committee’s symmetric inflation goal.
The Committee also directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve’s agency mortgagebacked securities transactions.” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p.m.: “Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in November indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising at a solid rate.
" Averaging through  hurricanerelated fluctuations, job gains have been solid, and the unemployment rate declined further."
" Household spending has been expanding at a moderate rate, and growth in business fixed investment has pi cked up in recent quarters."
" On a 12month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy have declined this year and are running below 2 percent."
" Marketbased measures of inflation compensation remain low; surveybased measures of longerterm inflation expectations are little changed, on balance."
"Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
" Hurricanerelated disruptions and rebuilding have affected economic activity, employment, and inflation in recent months but have not materially altered the outlook for the national economy."
" Consequently, the Committee continues to expect that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity  will expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions will remain strong."
" Inflation on a 12 ‐month basis is Minutes of the Meeting of December 12–13, 2017Page 9_____________________________________________________________________________________________    expected to remain somewhat below 2 percent in the near term but to stabilize around the Committee’s 2 percent objective over the medium term."
" Nearterm risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced, but the Committee is monitoring inflation developments closely."
"In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 1¼ to 1½ percent."
" The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting strong labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation."
"In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation."
" This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
 The Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to its symmetric inflation goal.
"  In Mr. Evans’s view, with inflation continuing to run substantially below 2 percent and measures of inflation expectations lower than he believed to be consistent with a symmetric 2 percent infl ation objective, it was important to pause in the process of policy normalization."
" Leaving the target range at 1 to 1¼ percent for a time would better support an increase in inflation expectations, increase the likelihood that inflation will rise to 2 percent and perhaps modestly beyond, and thus provide more support for the symmetry of the Committee’s inflation objective."
 Such a pause also would better allow the Committee time to assess the degree to which earlier soft readings on inflation were transitory or more persistent.
"In Mr. Kashkari’s view, while employment growth remained strong, wage growth had not picked up and inflation remained notably below the Committee’s 2 percent target."
 He was concerned that the flattening yield curve was partly due to falling longerterm inflation expectations or a lower neutral real rate of interest.
 He preferred to wait for inflation to move closer to 2 percent on a sustained basis or for inflation expectations to move up before further raising the target range for the federal funds rate.
"To support the Committee’s decision to raise the target range for the federal funds rate, the Board of Governors voted unanimously to raise the interest rates on required and excess reserve balances ¼ percentage point, to 1½ percent, effective December 14, 2017."
" (Secretary’s note: Subsequently, the Federal Reserve Bank s of Chicago, St. Louis, and Minneapolis were informed by the Secretary of the Board of the Board’s approval of their establishment of a primary credit rate of 2 percent, effective December 14, 2017.)  The second vote of the Board also encompassed approval of the establishment of the interest rates for secondary and seasonal credit under the existing formulas for computing such rates."
"Clouse Secretary Minutes of the Meeting of December 12–13, 2017Page 11_____________________________________________________________________________________________    Summary of Economic ProjectionsIn conjunction with the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting held on December 12–13, 2017, meeting participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real gross domestic product (GDP) growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2017 to 2020 and over the longer run.1  Each participant’s projection was based on information available at the time of the meeting, together with his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy—including a path for the federal funds rate and its longerrun value—and assumptions about other factors likely to affect economic outcomes."
" The longerrun projections represent each participant’s assessment of the value to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy.2  “Appropriate monetary policy” is defined as the future path of policy that each participant deems most likely to foster outcomes for economic activity and inflation that best satisfy his or her individual interpretation of the statutory mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability."
"All participants who submitted longerrun projections expected that, under appropriate monetary policy, growth in real GDP in 2018 would be somewhat stronger than their individual estimates of its longerrun rate."
" All participants projected that real GDP growth would moderate in 2019, and nearly all predicted that it would ease further in 2020; a solid majority of participants thought that growth in real GDP would be at or close to their individual estimates of the economy’s longerrun growth rate by 2020."
 All participants who submitted longerrun projections expected that the unemployment rate would run below their estimates of its longerrun normal level thro ugh 2020.
" Participants generally projected that inflation, as measured by the fourquarter percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), would step up toward the Committee’s 2 percent objective in 2018 and be at or                                                  1 Four members of the Board of Governors were in office at the time of the December 2017 me eting, the same number as in September 2017."
"  Most participants indicated that prospective changes in federal tax policy were a factor that led them to boost their projections of real GDP growth over the next couple of years; some participants, however, noted that they had already incorporated at least some effects of future tax cuts in their September projections."
"As shown in figure 2, part icipants generally expected that the evolution of the economy relative to their objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation would likely warrant further gradual increases in the federal funds rate."
" Participan ts generally noted several sources of uncertainty about the future course of the federal funds rate, including the details of potential changes in tax policy, how those changes would affect the economy, and the range of factors influencing inflation over the medium term."
"In general, participants viewed the uncertainty attached to their economic projections as broadly similar to the average of the past 20 years, and all participants saw the uncertainty associated with their projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as essentially unchanged from September."
"2 One participant did not submit longerrun projections for real output growth, the unemployment rate, or the federal funds rate."

Projections for the unemployment rate are for the average civilian unemployment rate in the fourthquarter of the year indicated.
Each participant’s projections are based on his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy.
Longerrun projections represent each participant’sassessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy.
"One participant did not submit longerrun projections for the change in real GDP, the unemployment rate, or the federal funds rate in conjunction withthe September 19–20, 2017, meeting, and one participant did not submit such projections in conjunction with the December 12–13, 2017, meeting.1.

"One participant did notsubmit longerrun projections for the federal funds rate.Page 4Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________    ber, most participants judged the risks around their projections for economic growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as broadly balanced."
"The Outlook for Economic Activity The median of participants’ projections for the growth rate of real GDP for 2018, conditional on their individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy, was 2.5 percent, the same as for 2017."
" The median projections for GDP growth in 2019 and 2020 were slightly lower, at 2.1 and 2.0 percent, respectively ."
" Compared with the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) from September, the median of the projections for real GDP growth for 2018 was notably higher, while the medians for real GDP growth for 2019 and 2020 were modestly higher."
 The median of projections for the longerrun normal rate of real GDP growth remained at 1.8 percent.
" Most participants pointed to changes in tax policy as likely to provide some boost to real GDP growth over the forecast period; in Septem ber, fewer than half of the participants incorporated prospective tax policy changes in their projections."
"  The medians of projections for the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of both 2018 and 2019 were 3.9 percent, 0.2 percentage point below the medians from September and about ¾ percentage point below the median assessment of its longerrun normal level."
 The median projection for the unemployment rate ticked up slightly to  4.0 percent in 2020.
Figures 3.A and 3.B show the distributions of participants’ projections for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate from 2017 to 2020 and in the longer run.
" The distribution of individual projections for real GDP growth for 2018 shifted up, with more than half of the participants now expecting real GDP growth of 2.5 percent or more and none seeing it below 2.2 percent."
" The distribution of projected real GDP growth in 2019 and 2020 also shifted up, albeit only slightly."
 The distribution for the longerrun normal rate of GDP growth was little changed from September.
" The distributions of individual projections for th e unemployment rate in 2018 and 2019 shifted down relative  to those in September, broadly consistent with the changes in the distributions for real GDP growth."
"The Outlook for Inflation The median of projections for headline PCE price inflation was 1.9 percent in 2018 and 2 percent in 2019 and 2020, the same as in the Sept ember SEP."
" Most participants anticipated that inflation would continue to run a bit below 2 percent in 2018, and only one participant expected inflation above 2 percent that year."
 A majority of participants projected that inflation would be equal to the Committee’s objective in 2019 and 2020.
 The medians of projections for core PCE price inflation over the 2018–20 period were the same as th ose for headline inflation.
Figures 3.C and 3.D provide information on the distributions of participants’ views about the outlook for inflation.
" On the whole, the distributions of projections for headline PCE price inflation and core PCE price inflation beyond 2017 were little changed from September."
Appropriate Monetary Policy Figure 3.E provides the distribution of participants’ judgments regarding the appropriate target—or midpoint of the target range—for the federal funds rate at the end of each year from 2017 to 2020 and in the longer run.
" This view was predicated on several factors, incl uding a judgment that the neutral real interest rate was currently low and would move up only slowly, as well as the balancing of risks associated with, among other things, the possibility that inflation pressures could bu ild if the economy expands well beyond its longrun sustainable level, and the possibility that the forces depressing inflation could prove to be more persistent than currently anticipated."

" As a reference, table 2 provides a measure of forecast uncertainty, based on the forecast errors of various private and government forecasts over the past 20 years, for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and total consumer price inflation."
"Participants’ assessments of the level of uncertainty surrounding their economic projections are shown in the bottomleft panels of figures 4.A, 4.B, and 4.C.  Nearly all participants viewed the de gree of uncertainty attached to their economic projections about GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as broadly similar to the average of the past 20 years, a view that was essentially unchanged from September.4  About half of the participants who commented on this topic suggested that uncertainties about the details of the pending tax legislation had raised their assessment of uncertainty for GDP growth, albeit not by enough to tip their assessments into the higherthan-average category."
" Accordingly, participants’ assessments of the balance of risks to their economic projections are shown in the bottomright panels of figures 4.A, 4.B, and 4.C.  As in September, most participants judged the risks to their projections of real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, headline inflation and core inflation as broadly balanced—in other words, 4 At the end of this summary, the box “Forecast Uncertainty” discusses the sources and interpretation of uncertainty in the economic forecasts and explains the approach used to assess Table 2."

 ±0.2 ±1.0 ±1.1 ±1.0 Shortterm interest rates3 .
" As described in the box “Forecast Uncertainty,” under certain assumptions, there is about a 70 pe rcent probability that actual outcomes for real GDP, unemployment, consumer prices, and the federal funds rate will be in ranges implied by the average size of projection errors made in the past."
" The balance of risks to the economic outlook shifted slightly in the direction of strength, with two more participants seeing upside risks to growth in real GDP than in September and one more seeing risks to the unemployment rate as weighted to the downside."
" In addition, one more participant than before saw risks to inflation as weighted to the upside."
" Because the Committee adjusts the federal funds rate in response to actual and prospective developments over time in real GDP growth, unemployment, and inflation, uncertainty surrounding the projected path for the funds rate importantly reflects the uncertainties about the path for those key economic variables."

"The conﬁdence interval is not strictly consistent with theprojections for the federal funds rate, primarily because these projections are not forecasts of the likeliest outcomes forthe federal funds rate, but rather projections of participants’ individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy.Still, historical forecast errors provide a broad sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rategenerated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policythat may be appropriate to oﬀset the eﬀects of shocks to the economy.The conﬁdence interval is assumed to be symmetric except when it is truncated at zero—the bottom of the lowesttarget range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted in the past by the Committee."
This truncation wouldnot be intended to indicate the likelihood of the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary policyaccommodation if doing so was judged appropriate.
"Because currentconditions may diﬀer from those that prevailed, on average, over the previous 20 years, the width and shape of theconﬁdence interval estimated on the basis of the historical forecast errors may not reﬂect FOMC participants’ currentassessments of the uncertainty and risks around their projections.* The conﬁdence interval is derived from forecasts of the average level of shortterm interest rates in the fourthquarter of the year indicated; more information about these data is available in table 2."
"The shaded area encompassesless than a 70 percent conﬁdence interval if the conﬁdence interval has been truncated at zero.Summary of Economic Projections of the Meeting of December 12–13, 2017Page 15_____________________________________________________________________________________________       Forecast Uncertainty The economic projections provided by the members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks inform discussions of monetary policy among policymakers and can aid public understanding of the basis for policy actions."
" Thus, in setting the stance of monetary policy, participants consider not only what appears to be the most likely economic outcome as embodied in their projections, but also the range of alternative possibilities, the likelihood of their occurring, and the potential costs to the economy should they occur."
"Table 2 summarizes the average historical accuracy of a range of forecasts, includ ing those reported in past Monetary Policy Report s and those prepared by the Federal Reserve Board’s staff in advance of meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)."
" The corresponding 70 percent confidence intervals for overall inflation would be 1.8 to 2.2 percent in the current year, 1.0 to 3.0 percent in the second year, 0.9 to 3.1 percent in the third year, and 1.0 to 3.0 percent in the fourth year."
" Figures 4.A through 4.C illustrate these confidence bounds in “fan charts” that are symmetric and centered on the medians of FOMC participants’ projections for GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation."
" In particular, the unemployment rate cannot be negative; furthermore, the risks around a particular projection might be tilted to either the upside or the downside, in which case the corresponding fan chart would be asymmetrically positioned around the median projection."
" These judgments are summarized in the lowerright panels of figures 4.A through 4.C. As with real activity and inflation, the outlook for the future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable uncertainty."
 This uncertainty arises primarily because each participant’s assessment of th e appropriate stance of monetary policy depends importantly on the evolution of real activity and inflation over time.
 The final line in  table 2 shows the error ranges for forecasts of shortterm interest rates.
" However, the forecast errors should provide a sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as addi tional adjustments to monetary policy that would be appropriat e to offset the effects of shocks to the economy."
 This approach to the construction of the federal funds rate fan chart would be merely a convention; it would not have any implications for possible future policy decisions regarding the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary polic y accommodation if doing so were appropriate.
