"Clark, Terry Fitzgerald, and Òscar Jordà, Vice President s, Federal Reserve Bank s of Cleveland, Minneapolis , and San Francisco, respectively                                                    4 Attended the discussions on monetary policy and System Open Market Account reinvestment policy."
" These changes reportedly reflected revisions to investors’ expectations for fiscal and other economic polic ies; some increase in geopolitical tensions ; economic and inflation indicators that, on balance , were weaker than anticipated ; and monetary policy communications."
 The manager also briefed the Committee on developments regarding certain reference interest rates.
 The manager also noted that aspects of plans to publish reference interest rates for market repurchase agreements (repos) were being modified to incorpora te a newly available source of data on cleared bilateral repo transactions; the modifications were expected to extend the time frame for publication of the new rates by several months.
"Staff Review of the Economic Situation  The information reviewed for the May 2 –3 meeting indicated that the labor market strengthened further in March but that growth of real gross domestic product (GDP) slowed in the first quarter, with the slowing likely reflecting transitory factors."
 Surveybased measures of inflation expectations were little changed on balance.
" Total nonfarm payroll employment rose in March, but the gain was smaller than in recent months, likely reflecting both warmer -thanusual temperatures in February that probably caused some hiring to be moved forward and a major winter storm in the Northeast in March that probably held down hiring somewhat; nevertheless, the increase in employment for the first quarter as a whole was solid."
" The unemployment rate decreased to 4.5  percent in March, and the labor force participation rate was unchanged."
 The four -week moving average of initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits remained at a very low level through mid -April.
" The employment cost index for private workers increased 2¼  percent over the 12 months ending in March, and average hourly earnings for all employees increased 2¾  percent over the same period; both increases were somewhat larger than those over the 12 months ending in March 2016."
" The average unemployment rate for whites in the first quarter of this year was ½  percentage point lower than its annual average for 2015, while the unemployment rates for Hispanics and for African Americans were about 1 percentage point and 1¾ percentage points lower, respectively."
" As of the first quarter, the unemployment rates for African Americans and for Hispanics remained above the rate for whites both overall and for people with similar educational backgrounds."
 Unemployment rates for Asians remained below those for whites.
" Recent readings on key factors that influence consumer spending pointed to solid growth in real PCE in coming quarters, including further gains in employment, real disposable personal income, and households’ net worth."
 Business inventory investment slowed sharply last quarter and held down real GDP growth significantly.
The U.S. international trade deficit narrowed in February.
 Preliminary data on trade in goods suggested that the trade deficit was about unchanged in March.
 The Bureau of Economic Analysis estimated that real net exports added slightly to growth of real GDP in the first quarter.
" Core PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in food and energy prices, was about 1½ percent over those same 12 months."
" Over the 12 months ending in March, total consumer prices as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) rose 2½ percent, while core CPI inflation was 2  percent."
" The median of longer -run inflation expectations from the Michigan survey edged down a bit, on balance, in recent months, while the medians from the Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants were little changed."
 Foreign real GDP growth appeared to have strengthened in the first quarter after slowing somewhat in the fourth quarter.
" In the advanced foreign economies (AFEs), indicators for the first quarter pointed to faster economic growth in Canada and solid growth in the euro area and J apan."
" By contrast, real GDP growth in the United Kingdom slowed significantly."
" More recent indicators were consistent with moderate economic growth in most AFEs.  In the emerging market economies (EMEs), growth picked up in China and some Asian economies  in the first quarter but slowed moderately in Mexico."
" Recent data also suggested that economic activity improved in parts of South America, most notably in Brazil where positive growth likely resumed in the first quarter."
" Inflation in the AFEs continued to rise, largely because of the pass -through of earlier increases in crude oil prices into retail energy prices."
" In the EMEs, inflation fell in China in the first quarter, reflecting a sharp drop in food prices, but was pushed up in Mexico by fuel price hikes and pass -through from past currency depreciation."
" While inflation compensation based on Treasury   InflationProtected Securities decreased at near -term horizons, partly reflecting the lower -thanexpected March CPI release , farterm inflation compensation was little changed on net."
" Private -sector analysts continued to project robust profit growth for S&P 500 firms over 2017 even as first -quarter earnings, on a seasonally adjusted basis, were estimated to be a bit lower than in the fourth quarter."
 Growth of CRE loans on banks’ books slowed in the first quarter but continued to be robust overall.
 Domestic respondents to the April SLOOS generally reported tightening their lending standards and experiencing weaker loan demand across all major CRE loan categories d uring the first quarter.
" Banks also reported that demand for some  categories of RRE loans weakened during the first quarter, including those insured or guaranteed by government agencies."
" In line with lower reported demand, growth in RRE loans on banks’ balance sheets  declined."
 Consumer credit appeared to be broadly available even as interest rates charged on credit card balances and new auto loans drifted up in line with their benchmark shorterterm interest rates.
" Growt h in consumer loan balances moderated a bit further from the relatively strong pace seen during the past few years, although yearover-year growth in credit card balances, student loans, and auto loans stayed in the 6 to 7 percent  range through February."
" In the April SLOOS, banks reported tightening standards on auto loans and easing standards on credit card loans ; banks also reported facing weaker demand for both auto and credit card loans ."
" Staff Economic Outlook  In the U.S. economic forecast prepared by the staff for the May FOMC meeting, real GDP growth was projected to bounce back in the second quarter from its weak first -quarter reading."
"  Importantly, PCE growth was expected to pick up  to a stronger pace  in the spring, which would be more consistent with ongoing  gains in employment, real disposable personal income, and households’ net worth."
" In addition, the sharp decrease in the contribution to GDP growth from the change in inventory investment in the first quarter was not expected to be repeated."
" Beyond the near term, the forecast for real GDP growth was a little stronger, on net, than in the previous projection, mostly due to the effect of a somewhat lower assumed path for the exchange value of the dollar."
 The unemployment rate was projected to decline gradually over the next couple of years and to run somewhat below the staff’s estimate of its longer -run natural rate over this period; the staff’s estimate of the natural rate was revised down slightly in this forecast.
" The staff’s forecast for co nsumer price inflation, as measured by changes in the PCE price index, was revised down marginally for 2017 as a whole after incorporating the soft data on consumer prices for March, but it was essentially unrevised thereafter."
" Inflation was still expected to be somewhat higher  this year than last year, reflecting an upturn in the prices for food and  nonenergy imports as well as a slightly faster increase in Page 6Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________  energy prices."
 The staff continued to project that inflation would increase gradually in 2018 and 2019 and that it would be marginally below the Committee’s longer -run objective of 2 percent  in 2019.
"The staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as similar to the average of the past 20 years."
" The risks to the forecast for real GDP were seen as tilted to the downside, primarily reflecting the staff’s assessment that monetary policy appeared to be better positioned to respond to large positive shocks to the economic outlook than to substantial adverse ones."
" Consistent with the downside risks to aggregate demand, the staff viewed the risks to its outlook for the unemployment rate as tilted to the upside."
 The risks to the projection for inflation were judged to be roughly balanced.
 The downside risks from the possibility that long erterm inflation expectations may have edged down or that the dollar could appreciate substantially were seen as roughly counterbalanced by the upside risk that inflation could increase more than expected in an economy that was projected to continue operating above its longer -run potential.
" Participants ’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook  In their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants agreed that the information received over the intermeeting period in dicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen even as growth in economic activity  slowed in the first quarter."
" Job gains remained solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate declined."
" Household spending rose only modestly, but the fundamentals underpinning the continued growth of consumption remained solid."
" Inflation measured on a 12 -month basis recently had been  running close to the Committee’s 2 percent longerrun objective; consumer prices , both including and excluding prices of energy and food items, declined in March , and core inflation continued to run somewhat below 2  percent."
 Marketbased measures of inflation compensation remained low; survey -based measures of longer -term inflation expectations were little changed on balance.
" They continued to expect that , with further gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity would expand at a moderate pace, labor market conditions would strengthen somewhat further, and inflation would stabilize around 2  percent over the medium term."
" Some participants judged that the low reading on GDP growth also could partly reflect residual seasonality and so would likely be followed by stronge r GDP growth in subsequent quarters, repeating a pattern evidenced in recent years."
" They pointed to the encouraging tone of recent data on economic growth abroad, which suggested some upside risks to foreign economic activity."
" However, several  noted that downside risks to the global outlook remained , either because of geopolitical developments  and foreign political factors or because monetary policy normalization in the United States could lead to financial strains in  EMEs.  Many participants continued to view the possibility of expansionary fiscal policy changes in the United States as posing upside risks to their forecasts  for U.S. economic growth, although they also noted that prospects for enactment  of a more expa nsionary fiscal program, as well as its size, composition, and timing, remained highly uncertain."
" Regarding the outlook for inflation, a couple of participants expressed concern  that a substantial undershooting of the longer -run normal rate of unemployment could pose an appreciable upside risk to inflation."
" However, several others continued to see downside risks to the inflation outlook, particularly given the low readings on inflation over the intermeeting period and the stilllow measures of inflation compensation and inflaMinutes of the Meeting of May 2–3, 2017Page 7_____________________________________________________________________________________________  tion expectations."
 Participants  agreed that the Committee should continue to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments.
" While recent data suggested a significant slowdown of growth in consumption spending early in the year, participants expected to see a rebound in consumer spending in coming months in light of the solid fundamentals underpinning household spending , including ongoing job gains, rising household income and wealth, improved hous ehold balance sheets, and buoyant consumer sentiment."
" Nevertheless , contacts expected  that demand for motor vehicles would be well maintained."
" Bu siness contacts in some Districts reported that residential construction activity had not kept pace with demand, resulting in shortages in housing supply and upward pressure on prices."
 A few participants commented that firms engaged in international trade were benefiting from improvements in global demand conditions.
" At 4.5 percent, the unemployment rate had reached or fallen below levels that participants judged likely to be normal over the longer run."
" Increases in nonfarm payroll employment averaged almost 180,000 per month during the first quarte r, a pace that, if maintained , would be expected to result in further increases in labor utilization over time."
" Even so, several other participants  suggested some margins may remain along which l abor market utilization could increase further without giving  rise to inflationary pressures."
" However, a couple of participants pointed out that uncertainty about both the longerrun normal rate of unemployment and labor force trends made it difficult to assess the scope for additional sustainable increases in labor utilization."
" Generally, participants continued to expect that if economic growth stayed moderate, as they projected, the unemployment rate would remain , for the next few years , below their estimates of its longerrun normal level."
 A few participants  continued to anticipate a substantial undershooting of the longer -run normal level of the unemployment rate.
Readings on headline and core PCE price inflation  in March had come in lower than expected.
" On a 12month basis , headline PCE price  inflation had edged above the Committee’s 2  percent objective in February , but this measure  dropped back to 1.8  percent in March, in part reflecting  the effects of lower energy prices on the headline index."
" Core PCE price inflation, which historically has been a good predictor of future headline inflation, moved down to 1.6  percent over the 12 months ending in March."
 Several participants emphasized  that inflation measured on a 12 -month bas i s had been running very close to the Committee’s 2  percent target.
" Overall, most participants viewed the recent softer inflation data as primarily reflecting transitory factors , but a few expressed concern that progress toward the Committee’s objective may have slowed ."
"Marketbased Page 8Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________  measures of longer -term inflation compensation remained low, with five -year, fiveyear-forward CPI inflation compensation a bit below 2  percent—unchanged from the time of the March FOMC meeting but somewhat above levels registered last year."
" In addition, the median measure of inflation expectations  over the next 5 to 10 years  in the Michigan survey edged down  from 2.5 percent in February to 2.4 percent  in March and April."
 The three -yearahead measure of inflation expectations from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Survey of Consumer Expectations decreased from 3.0 percent to 2.7 percent in March and rose to 2.9 percent in April .
"  In light of  these developments, participants generally continued to expect that inflation would stabilize around the Committee’s 2  percent objective over the medium run as the effects of transitory factors waned and conditions in the labor market and the overall economy i mproved further."
"  Participants noted that import prices had begun to increase, supporting their expectation that inflation would gradually rise."
" A few participants , however, expressed uncertain ty about the reasons for the recent unexpected weakness in inflation measures  and about its implications for the inflation outlook."
" They noted variously that the decline in longerterm interest rates and the modest depreciation  of the dollar over the intermeeting period would provid e some stimu lus to aggregate demand , that the Committee’s recent policy actions had not resulted in a tightening of financial conditions , or that some of the decline in longerterm yields reflected investors’ perceptions of diminished odds of significant fiscal stimulus and an increase in some geopolitical and foreign  political risks."
"  In their consideration o f monetary policy, participants judged that it was appropriate to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged at this meeting."
" Although the data on aggregate spending and inflation received over the intermeeting period were, on balance,  weaker than participants expected, they  generally saw the outlook for the economy and inflation as little changed and judged that a continued gradual removal of monetary policy accommodation  remained appropriate ."
" Participants generally agreed that the current stance of monetary policy remained accommodative, supporting some additional strengthening in labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2  percent inflation."
" Some participants noted  that core PCE price inflation had been running below the Committee’s objective for overall inflation for the past eight years  and that it was important to return inflation to 2 percent, or that the public’s longerterm inflation expectations may have fallen somewhat, and that a gradual approach to tightening could help return expectations and inflation to 2  percent."
" One participant cited results of  a District survey of businesses indicat ing that more than one -third of respondents saw the Federal Reserve as more likely to accept inflation below its 2 percent objective than above ; that participant interpreted the survey results as suggesting that the Committee’s communications about the symmetry of its inflation objective had not completely taken hold , a concern also mentioned by a couple of other participants ."
" Several participants, however,  pointed to conditions under which the Committee might need to consider a somewhat more rapid removal of monetary accommodation— for Minutes of the Meeting of May 2–3, 2017Page 9_____________________________________________________________________________________________  instance, if the unemployment rate fell appreciably further than currently projected, if wages increased more rapidly than expected, or if highly stimulative fiscal policy changes  were to be enacted ."
" In contrast, a  couple of others judged that the Committee could withdraw monetary accommodation even more gradually than reflected in the medians of  forecasts in the March Summary of Economic Projections, noting that slack might remain in the labor market or that inflation was not very sensitive to declines in the unemployment  rate below its estimated longer -run normal level."
"Committee Policy Action  In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that information received since the Committee met in March indic ated that the labor market had continued to strengthen even as growth in economic activity had slowed."
" Job gains had remained solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate had declined."
" Household spending had risen only modestly, but the  fundamentals underpinning the continued growth of consumption remained solid, while business fixed investment had firmed."
" Inflation, measured as the 12month change in the headline PCE price index,  had been running close to the Committee ’s 2 percent longerrun objective."
 Core inflation continued to run somewhat below 2  percent.
" Marketbased measures of inflation compensation had remained low, while survey -based measures of longer -term inflatio n expectations had changed little on balance."
"With respect to the economic outlook and its implications for monetary policy, members agreed that the slowing in growth during the first quarter was likely to be transitory and continued to expect that, with g radual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity would expand at a moderate pace, labor market conditions would strengthen somewhat further, and inflation would stabilize around 2  percent over the medium term."
 A couple of members noted that the outlook for global growth appeared to have brightened and that downside risks from abroad had waned.
 Members agreed that they would continue to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments.
" After assessing current conditions and the outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, members agreed to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at ¾ to 1 percent."
" They noted that the stance of monetary policy remained accommodative, thereby supporting some further strengthening in labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2  percent inflation."
Members generally judged that it would be prudent to await additional evidence indicating that the recent slowing in the pace of economic activity had been transitory before taking another step in removing accommodation.
" Members agreed that, in determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee would assess realized and expected economic conditions relativ e to its objectives of maximum employment and 2  percent inflation."
" This assessment would take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
" Members also agreed to continue to carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to the Committee’s symmetric inflation goal, with one member viewing further progress of inflation toward the 2 percent objective as necessary before taking another step to remove policy accommodation."
” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00  p.m.: “Information  received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in March indicates that the labor market has continued  to strengthen  even as growth in economic  activity slowed.
" Job gains were solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate declined."
" Household  spending rose only modestly, but the fundamentals  underpinning  the continued  growth of consumption remained solid."
 Inflation measured on a 12month basis recently has been running close to the Committee ’s 2 percent  longerrun objective.
" Excluding energy and food, consumer prices declined in March and inflation continued  to run somewhat below 2 percent."
" Marketbased measures of inflation compensation remain low; surveybased measures of longerterm inflation expectations  are little changed, on balance."
" Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment  and price stability."
" The Committee  views the slowing in growth during the first quarter as likely to be transitory and continues to expect that, with gradual adjustments  in the stance of monetary policy, economic  activity will expa nd at a moderate pace, labor market conditions  will strengthen  somewhat  further, and inflation will stabilize around 2 percent  over the medium term."
 The Committee  continues to closely monitor inflation indicators  and global economic  and financial developments.
"In view of realized and expected labor market conditions  and inflation, the Committee  decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at ¾ to 1 percent ."
" The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative,  thereby supporting  some further strengthening  in labor market conditions  and a sustained return to 2 percent  inflation."
"In determining  the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee  will assess realized and expected economic  conditions  relative to its objectives  of maximum  employment and 2 percent inflation."
" This assessment  will take into account a wide range of information,  including measures of labor market conditions,  indicators  of inflation pressures and inflation expectations,  and readings on financial and international  developments ."
 The Committee  will carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to its symmetric  inflation goal.
"Consistent with the Committee ’s decision to leave the target ran ge for the federal funds rate unchanged, the Board of Governors voted unanimously to leave the interest rates on required and excess reserve balances unchanged at  1 percent  and voted unanimously to approve establishment of the primary credit rate (discount  rate) at the existing level of  1½ percent .6  System Open Market Account Reinvestment Policy  Participants continued their discussion of issues related to potential changes to the Committee’s policy of reinvesting principal payments from securities held in the SOMA."
 Limiting the magnitude of the monthly reductions in the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings on an ongoing basis could help mitigate the risk of adverse effects on market functioning or outsized effects on interest rates.
Madigan  Secretary                                                  6 The second vote of the Board also encompassed approval of the establishment of the interest rates for secondary and seasonal credit under the existing formulas for computing such rates.
