"________________________ 1 In general, as specified in Article IV, each member of the IMF undertakes to collaborate with the IMF and other members to assure orderly exchange arrangements and to promote a stable system of exchange rates."
 These obligations include seeking to direct the member’s economic and financial policies toward the objective of fostering orderly economic growth with reasonable price stability.
 These obligations also include avoiding manipulating exchange rates or the international monetary system in such a way that would imped e effective balance of payments adjustment or to give an unfair competitive advantage over other members.
"In the Committee’s annual  reconsideration of the Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, participants agreed that only a minor revision was required at this meeting, which was to update the reference to participants’ estimates of the longer -run normal rate of unemployment from 4.9 percent to 4.8 percent ."
"  STATEMENT ON LONGER -RUN GOALS AND MONETARY POLICY STRATEGY  (As amended effectiv e January 31, 2017)  “The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is firmly committed to fulfilling its statutory mandate from the Congress of promoting maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long -term interest rates."
 The Committee seeks to explain i ts monetary policy decisions to the public as clearly as possible.
" Such clarity facilitates well -informed decisionmaking by households and businesses, reduces economic and financial uncertainty, increases the effectiveness of monetary policy, and enhances  transparency and accountability, which are essential in a democratic society."
" Inflation, employment, and long -term interest rates fluctuate over time in response to economic and financial disturbances."
" Moreover, monetary policy actions tend to influence  economic activity and prices with a lag."
" The inflation rate over the longer run is primarily determined by monetary policy, and hence the Committee has the ability to specify a longer -run goal for inflation."
" The Committee reaffirms its judgment that inflation at the rate of 2  percent, as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, is most consistent over the longer run with the Federal Reserve’s statutory mandate."
 The Committee would be concerned if inflation were running  persistently above or below this objective.
" Communicating this symmetric inflation goal clearly to the public helps keep longer -term inflation expectations firmly anchored, thereby fostering price stability and moderate long -term interest rates and enhan cing the Committee’s ability to promote maximum employment in the face of significant economic disturbances."
 The maximum level of employment is largely determined by nonmonetary factors that affect the structure and dynamics of the labor market.
" Consequently, it would not be appropriate to specify a fixed goal for employment; rather, the Committee’s policy decisions must be informed by assessments of the maximum level of employment, recognizing that such assessments are necessarily uncertain and subject to revision."
 Information about Committee participants’ estimates of the longer -run normal rates of output growth and unemployment is published four times per year in the FOMC’s Summary of Economic Projections.
" For example, in the most recent projections, the median of FOMC participants’ estimates of the longer -run normal rate of unemployment was 4.8  percent."
" In setting monetary policy, the Committee seeks to mitigate deviations of inflation from its longer -run goal and deviations of employment from the Committee’s assessments of its maximum level."
" However, under circumstances in which the Committee judges that the objectives are not complementary, it follows a balanced approach in promoting them, taking into account the magnitude of the deviations and the potentially different time horizons over which employment and inflation are projected to return to levels judged consistent with its mandate."
" Emerging market currencies were generally resilient in recent weeks, reportedly benefiting from investors’ anticipation of stronger global economic growth, after depreciating significantly against the dollar during the previous intermeeting period."
" In money markets, interest rates smoothly shifted higher following the Committee’s decision at its December meeting to increase the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points, and federal funds subsequently traded near the center of the new range except on year -end."
" Consumer price inflation rose further above the slow pace seen during the first half of last year , but it was still running below the Committee’s longer -run objective of 2 percent."
 Total nonfarm payroll employment increased at a solid pace in December.
" The unemployment rate edged up to 4.7 percent but remained near its recent low, whi le the labor force participation rate rose slightly."
 The  fourweek moving average of initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits was still low in December and early January.
" The employment cost index for private industry Minutes of the Meeting of January 31–February 1, 2017Page 9_____________________________________________________________________________________________  workers rose 2¼ percent over the 12 months ending in December, and average hourly earnings for all employees increased almost 3 percent over the same 12month period."
" The unemployment rates for African Americans, for Hispanics, and for whites were close to the levels seen just before the most recent recession, but the unemployment rates for African Americans and for Hispanics remained above the rate for whites."
" Recent readings on some key factors that influence consumer spending —including further gains in employment, real disposable personal income, and households’ net worth—were consistent with moderate increases in real PCE in early 2017."
 The change in real inventory investment was estimated to have made an appreciable positive contribution to real GDP growth in the fourth quarter.
 The U.S. international trade deficit widened in November for the second conse cutive month.
" The Census Bureau’s advance trade estimates for December suggested a narrowing of the trade deficit in goods, as imports increased less than exports."
" Altogether, the change in real net exports was estim ated to have made a substantial negative contribution to real GDP growth in the fourth quarter."
" Core PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in food and energy prices, was 1¾ percent over those same 12 months, held down in part by decreases in the prices of non -energy imports over part of this per iod."
" Over the same 12month period, total consumer prices as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) rose a bit more than 2 percent, while core CPI inflation was 2¼ percent."
"  Surveybased measures of median longer -run inflation expectations —such as th ose from the Michigan survey and from the Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants —were unchanged, on net, over December and January."
 Foreign real GDP growth appeared to slow somewhat in the fourth quarter from its relatively stro ng thirdquarter pace.
" Nevertheless, recent data on foreign industrial production and trade seemed to be stronger than private analysts  had anticipated  and were consistent with moderate economic growth abroad."
" In the emerging market economies (EMEs), GDP growth remained robust in Page 10Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________  China but slowed elsewhere in the Asian EMEs and in Mexico, while the pace of economic  contraction appeared to lessen in South Ame rica."
" Inflation in the advanced foreign economies (AFEs) continued to rise, largely reflecting the pass -through of earlier increases in crude oil prices into retail energy prices."
" Inflation also rose in many EMEs, in part because of rising food and fuel prices; however, inflation fell notably in much of South America."
 Measures  of inflation compensation based on Treasury Inflation -Protected Securities (TIPS) rose somewhat on balance.
 TIPSbased measures of inflation compensation edged up over the intermeeting period.
" However, equity prices remained notably higher than just before the November elections, apparently reflecting investors’ expectations that fiscal and other policy changes would boost corporate profits and economic activity in the medium term."
" Meanwhile, after a slowdown in the third quarter, the growth of commercial and industrial (C&I) loans on banks’ books picked up in the fourth quarter, although the pace remained slower than earlier in the year."
" The interest rate on 30 -year fixed -rate mortgages moved about in line with rates on  comparable -maturity Treasury securities, rising notably after the November election s but retracing part of that increase since mid -December."
" The staff’s assessment took into account the increase in asset valuation pressures since the November elections, the overall low level of financial leverage, the strong capital positions at banks, and the subdued growth of debt among households and businesses."
" Real GDP growth in the fourth quarter of last year was estimated to have been a little faster than the staff had expected in December, and the pace of economic growth in the first half of this year was projected to be essentially the same as in the fourth quarter."
 The staff’s forecast for real GDP growth over the next several years was little changed.
 The unemployment rate was forecast to edge down gradually through the end of 2019 and to run below the staff’s estimate of its longer -run natural rate; the p ath for the unemployment rate was little changed from the previous projection.
 The staff’s forecast for consumer price inflation was unchanged on balance.
" The staff continued to project that inflation would increase over the next several years, as food and energy prices , along with the prices of nonenergy imports , were expected to begin steadily rising either this year or next."
" However, inflation was projected Page 12Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________  to be marginally below the Committee’s longer -run objective of 2 percent in 2019."
" The staff vie wed the uncertainty around its projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as similar to the average of the past 20 years."
" The risks to the forecast for real GDP were seen as tilted to the downside, primarily reflecting the staff ’s assessment that monetary policy appeared to be better positioned to offset large positive shocks than substantial adverse ones."
" Consistent with the downside risks to aggregate demand, the staff viewed the risks to its outlook for the unemployment rate as tilted to the upside."
 The risks to the projection for inflation were seen as roughly balanced.
 The downside risks from the possibility that longer -term inflation expectations may have edged down or that the dollar could appreciate substantially further  were seen as roughly counterbalanced by the upside risk that inflation could increase more than expected in an economy that was proj ected to continue operating above its longer -run potential.
" Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook  In their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants agreed that information received over the int ermeeting period indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had continued to expand at a moderate pace."
" Job gains had remained solid, and the unemployment rate had stayed near its recent low."
 Inflation had increased in recent quarters but was still below the Committee’s 2  percent longer -run objective.
 Marketbased measures of inflation compensation remained low; most survey -based measures of inflation compensation were little changed on balance.
" They continued to anticipate that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity would expand at a moderate pace, labor market conditions would strengthen somewhat further, and inflation would rise to 2 perce nt over the medium term."
 Participants again emphasized their considerable uncertainty about the prospects for changes in  fiscal and other government  policies as well as about the timing and magnitude of the  net effects of such changes on economic activity.
" In addition, several viewed the downside risks from we aker economic activity abroad as having diminished somewhat."
" But  several indicated that they continued to be concerned about the downside risks to economic activity associated with the possibility of additional appreciation of the foreign exchange value of the dollar or financial vulnerabilities in some foreign economies , together with  the proximity of the federal funds rate to the effective lower bound."
" Regarding the outlook for inflation, some participants continued to be concerned that faster -thanexpected economic growth or a substantial undershooting of the longerrun normal unemployment rate  posed upside risks to inflation."
"  However, several others continued to see downside risks to the inflation outlook, citing stilllow measures of inflation compensation and inflation expectations or the possibility of furthe r appreciation of the  dollar."
 Participants generally agreed that the Committee should continue to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments.
" Regarding the household sector, consumer spending posted a moderate increase in the fourth quarter , and participants generally anticipated that further gains in consumer spending would contribute importantly to economic growth in 2017."
" They expected that, although interest rates had moved higher, household spending would continue to be supported by rising employment and income as well as high levels of household wealth."
" In addition, a few participants noted that prospects for residential investMinutes of the Meeting of January 31–February 1, 2017Page 13_____________________________________________________________________________________________  ment would also depend on whether household formation picked up and how housing market  activity responded to the recent rise in mortgage interest rates."
" Monthly gains in nonfarm payroll employment averaged 165,00 0 over the period from October to December, a pace that, if it continued,  would be expected  to increase labor utilization  over time."
" At 4.7 percent in December, t he unemployment rate remained close to levels that most participants judged to be c onsistent with the Committee’ s maximumemployment objective."
" However, a couple of participants pointed out that the uncertainty attending estimates of longerrun trends in parttime employment and labor force participation made  it difficult to  assess the scope for additional increases in labor utilization ."
" Most participants still expect ed that if economic growth remained moderate, labor markets would continue to tighten gradually, with the unemployment rate running only modestly below their estimates of the longer -run normal rate ."
Information on inflation received over the intermeeting period was  broadly in line with participants’  expectations  and was consistent with a view that PCE inflation was moving closer to the Committee’s 2  percent objective .
" A few participants noted that other measures provided additional evidence that inflation was approaching the Committee’s objective; for example, the 12month changes  in the headline and core CPI, the median CPI, and the trimmed mean PCE price index  had also moved up from year -earlier levels."
 Most survey -based measures of longerterm inflation expectations had been little changed in recent months.
" The median response to the Michigan survey  of longer -run inflation expectations moved back up to 2.6 percent in January, in line with  the average of readings during 2016, and the measure at the threeyear horizon from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s survey rose slightly in December ; the measures calculated by the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland had been stable over the preceding three months."
" Some market -based measures of inflation compensation had turned up noticeably in late 2016, but a Page 14Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________  number of participants noted that they remained  relatively low."
 Most participants continued to expect that inflation would rise to the Committee’s 2  percent objective over the medium term .
" Some saw a risk  that inflationary pressures might develop more ra pidly than currently anticipated as resource utilization tightened,  while several others thought that progress in achieving the Committee’s inflation objective might lag  if further appreciation of the dollar continued to depress nonenergy commodity prices  or if inflation was slow to respond to tighter resource utilization."
" Financial conditions appeared to have changed little, on net, in recent months:  Equity prices had risen and credit spreads had narrowed, but longer -term interest rates had increased and the dollar had appreciated  further."
" More broadly, it was pointed out that an environment of low interest rates and a relatively flat yield curve, if it  persisted, had the potential to  boost incentives to take on leverage  and risk."
 Participants generally characterized their  economic forecasts and their judgments about monetary policy as little changed since the December meeting.
" Most participants continued to judge that, while the outlook was subject to considerab le uncertainty,  a gradual pace of rate increases  over time was likely to be appropriate to promote the Committee’s objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation."
 Some participants viewed a gradual pace as likely to be warranted because inflation was still running below the Committee’s objective or because the proximity of the federal funds rate to the effective lower bound placed constraints on the ability of monetary policy to respond to adverse shocks to the aggregate demand for goods and services.
" In addition, it was noted that the downward pressure on longer -term interest rates exerted by the Federal Reserve’s asset holdings was expected to diminish in the years ahead  in light of an anticipated gradual reduction in the size and duration of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet."
"  Finally, the view that gradual increases in the federal funds rate were likely to be appropriate also reflect ed the assessment that the neutral real rate—defined as the real interest rate that is neither expansionary nor contractionary when the economy is operating at or near its potential —was currently quite low and was likely to rise only slowly over time."
" These included upside risks  such as appreciably more expansionary fiscal policy or a more rapid buildup of inflationary pressures, as well as downside risks associated with a possible further appreciation of the dollar or financial vulnerabilities in some foreign economies, together with the proximity of the federal funds rate to the effective lower bound."
" Moreover, most participants continued to see heightened uncertainty regarding the size, composition, and timing of possible changes to fiscal and other government policies, and about their net effects on the economy and inflation over the medium term , and they thought some time would likely be required for the outlook to be come clearer."
" A couple of participants argued t hat such uncertainty should not deter the Committee from taking further steps in the near term  to remove monetary policy accommodation, because fiscal and other policies were Minutes of the Meeting of January 31–February 1, 2017Page 15_____________________________________________________________________________________________  only some of the many factors that were likely to influence progress toward the Co mmittee’s dualmandate objectives and thus the appropriate course of monetary policy."
" However, other participants cautioned against adjusting monetary policy in anticipation of  policy proposals that might not be enacted or that, if enacted, might turn out to have different consequences for economic activity and inflation than currently anticipated ."
"In discussing the outlook for monetary policy over the period ahead, many  participants expressed the view that it might be appropriate to raise the fede ral funds rate again fairly soon if incoming information on the labor market and inflation was in line with or stronger than their current expectations  or if the risks of overshooting the Committee’s maximum -employment and inflation objectives increased ."
" Several judged that the risk of a sizable undershooting of the longerrun normal unemployment rate was high, particularly if economic growth was faster than currently expected."
" If that situation developed,  the Committee might need to raise the federal funds rate  more quickly than most participants currently anticipated  to limit the buildup of inflationary pressures."
" However, with inflation still short of the Committee’s objective and inflation expectations remaining low, a few others continued to see downside ri sks to inflation or anticipated only a gradual return of inflation  to the 2 percent objective as the labor market strengthened further ."
"Committee Policy Action  In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that the information received since the Committee met in December indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had continued to expand at a moderate pace."
" Job gains had remained solid , and the unemployment rate had stayed near its recent low."
 Inflation had increased in recent quarters but was still below the Committee’s 2 percent longer -run objective.
 Marketbased measures of inflation compensation remained low; most survey -based measures of longer -term inflation expecta tions were little changed on balance.
" With respect to the economic outlook and its implications for monetary policy, members continued to expect that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity would expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions would strengthen somewhat further."
 Many members continued to see only a modest risk of a scenario in which the unemployment rate would substantially undershoot its longerrun normal level and inflation pressures  would increase significantly.
" These members expressed the  view that inflation was likely to rise  toward 2 percent  gradually, and that policymakers would likely have ample time to respond if signs of rising inflation ary pressures did begin to emerge ."
" Other members indicated that if the labor market appeared to b e tightening significantly more than anticipated or if inflation pressures appeared to be developing more rapidly than expected as resource utilization tightened, it might become necessary to adjust the Committee’s communications about the expected path of  the federal funds rate."
"  One member  noted that, even if incoming data on the economy and inflation were consistent with expectations, taking the next step in reducing policy accommodation relatively soon would give the Committee greater flexibility in calibrating policy to evolving economic conditions."
" At this meeting, members continued to expect that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, inflation would rise to the Committee’s 2 percent objective over the medium term."
 This view was reinforced by the rise in inflation and increases in inflation compensation  in recent months .
" Against this backdrop and in light of the current short fall in inflation from 2  percent, members agreed that they would continue to closely monitor actual and  expected progress toward the Committee’s inflation goal."
" Page 16Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________  After assessing current conditions and the outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, members agreed to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at ½ to ¾ percent."
" They judged that the stance of monetary policy remained accommodative, thereby supporting some further strengthening in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation."
" The Committee agreed that, in determining the timing and size of future adj ustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, it would assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation."
" This assessment would take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
 The Commit tee also directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve’s agency mortgage -backed securities transactions.” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p.m.: “Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in December indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has continued to expand at a moderate pace.
 Job gains remained solid and the unemployment rate stayed near its recent low.
 Inflation increased in rece nt quarters but is still below the Committee’s 2 percent longer -run objective.
" Market -based measures of inflation compensation remain low; most survey -based measures of longer -term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance."
"Consistent with its  statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
" The Committee expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, labor market conditions will  strengthen somewhat further, and inflation will rise to 2 percent over the medium term."
 The Committee continues to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments.
" In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at ½ to ¾  percent."
" The stance of Minutes of the Meeting of January 31–February 1, 2017Page 17_____________________________________________________________________________________________  monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting some further strengthening in labor market conditions and a return to 2  percent inflation."

" In light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2  percent, the Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal."
"Consistent with the Committee’s decision to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the Board of Governors voted unanimously to leave the interest rates on required and excess reserve balances unchanged at 0.75 percent and voted unanim ously to approve establishment of the primary credit rate (discount rate) at the existing level of 1.25 percent.6 It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday –Wednesday, March  14–15, 2017."
Madigan  Secretary                                                  6 The second vote of the Board also encompassed approval of the establishment of the interest rates for secondary and seasonal credit under the existing formulas for computing such rates.
