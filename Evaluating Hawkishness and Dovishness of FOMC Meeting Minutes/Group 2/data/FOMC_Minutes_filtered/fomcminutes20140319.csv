"Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information reviewed for the March 18 19 meeting indicated that economic growth slowed early this year, likely only in part because of the temporary effects of the unusually cold and snowy winter weather."
" Total payroll employment expanded further, while the unemployment rate held  steady, on balance, and was still elevated."
" Consumer price inflation continued to run below the Committee’s longerrun objective, but measures of longerrun inflation expectations remained stable."
  Total nonfarm payroll employment rose in January and February at a slower pace than in the fourth quarter of last year.
" The unemployment  rate was 6.7 percent in February, the same as in December of last year."
" The labor force participation rate, along with the            employmentto-population ratio, increased, on net, in recent months."
" Both the share of workers employed part time for economic reasons and the rate of longduration unemployment were  lower in February than they were late last year, although both measures were still high."
 Initial claims for unemployment insurance were little changed over the intermeeting period.
Growth in real private expenditures for business equipment and intellectual property products stepped up in the fourth quarter to a faster rate than in the third quarter.
"The U.S. international trade deficit, after widening in December, remained about unchanged in January."
"Total U.S. consumer price inflation, as measured by the PCE price index, was about 1¼ percent over the        12 months ending in January, continuing to run below the Committee’s longerrun objective of 2 percent."
 Both nearand longerterm inflation expectations from the Michigan survey were little changed in February  and early March.
" Over th e same yearlong period, the employment cost index and average hourly earnings for all employees rose only a little faster than consumer price inflation."
"Foreign real gross domestic product (GDP) expanded at a moderate pace in the fo urth quarter of 2013, with weak economic growth in Japan and Mexico offsetting stronger gains in many other economies."
" The economic recovery in the euro area appeared to be continuing, and the pace of Japanese economic growth looked to have picked up."
" In Canada, however, severe winter weather appeared to have held down economic activity in early 2014."
" Among the emerging market economies (EMEs), recent data suggested that economic growth in China was slowing in the first quarter, and that the rate of growth in the other Asian economies was also declining from a very robust fourthquarter pace."
" Mexican real GDP growth slowed sharply in the fourth quarter, led by a contraction in the manufacturing sector, but recent indicators, such as auto production, suggested some rebound in the pace of economic activity in the current quarter."
 Inflation increased slightly in some advanced economies but remained well below central bank s’ targets.
" At the same time, inflation declined in some emerging Asian economies."
 Monetary policy re mained highly accommodative in the advanced fore ign economies.
" Across the EMEs, monetary policy adjustments varied according to economic and financial developments, with some central banks tightening policy and others loosening it."
" On balance, U.S. financial conditions remained supportive of growth in economic activity and employment:  The expected path of the federal funds rate was little changed, longerterm yields on Treasury securities edged down, equity prices rose, speculativegrade corMinutes of the Meeting of March 18–19, 2014Page 3_____________________________________________________________________________________________porate bond spreads narrowed, and the foreign exchange value of the dollar depreciated slightly."
" The Monetary Policy Report and Chair Yellen’s accompanying congressional testimony in February were viewed as emphasizing continuity in the approach to monetary policy, solidifying expectations that the pace of the Committee’s asset purchases would be reduced by a further $10 billion at each upcoming meeting absent a material change in the economic outlook."
"Yields on shortand intermediateterm Treasury securities were little changed, on balance, over the intermeeting period, as the effects of a waning of flightto-quality demands early in the period roughly offset those of generally weakerthan-expected economic data."
 Measures of longerhorizon inflation compensation based on Treasury inflationprotected securities also declined somewhat.
" The increases in the interest rate offered by the Federal Reserve in its ON RRP exercise, along with the increases in caps for individual bids, also may have contributed to higher levels of activity at daily operations."
 The growth of commercial and industrial loans on banks’ balance sheets increased over the period.
 Mortgage interest rates and their spreads over Treasury yields were little changed over the intermeeting period.
"Staff Economic Outlook  In the economic forecast prepared by the staff for the March FOMC meeting, real GDP growth in the first half of this year was somewhat lower than in the projection for the January meeting."
" The available readings on consumer spending, residential construction, and business investment pointed to less spending growth in the first quarter than the staff had previously expected."
" The staff’s assessment was that the unusually severe winter weather could account for some, but not all, of the recent unanticipated weakness in economic activity, and the staff lowered its projection for nearterm output growth."
" Largely because of the combination of recent downward surprises in the unemployment rate and weakerthan-expected real GDP growth, the staff lowered slightly the assumed pace of potential output growth in recent years and over the projection period."
" As a result, the staff’s mediumterm forecast for real GDP growth also was revised down slightly."
" Nevertheless, the staff continued to project that real GDP would expand at a faster pace over the next few years than it did last year, and that real GDP growth would exceed the growth rate of po tential output."
" The faster pace of real GDP growth was expected to be supported by an easing in the restraint from changes in fiscal policy, increases in consumer and business confidence, further improvements in cred it availability and financial conditions, and a pickup in the rate of foreign economic growth."
" The expansion in economic activity was anticipated to lead to a slow reduction in resource slack over the projection period, and the unemployment rate was expected to decline gradua lly to the staff’s estimate of its longerrun natural rate."
 The staff continued to forecast that inflation would stay below the Committee’s longerrun objective of 2 percent over the next few years.
" Inflation was projected to rise gradually toward the Committee’s objective, as longerrun inflation expectations were assumed to remain st able, changes in commodity and import prices were expected to be subdued, and slack in labor and product markets was anticipated to diminish slowly."
" The staff’s March projections for both real GDP growth and the unemployment rate over the next few years were just slightly lower than in its December forecasts, while the inflation projection was essentially unchanged."
The staff viewed the extent of uncertainty around its March projections for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate as roughly in line with the average of the past 20 years.
" Nonetheless, the risks to th e forecast for real GDP growth were viewed as tilted a little to the downside, especially because the economy was not well positioned to withstand adverse shocks while the target for the federal funds rate was at its effective lower bound."
" At the same time, the staff viewed the risks around its outlook for the unemployment rate and for inflation as roughly balanced."
"Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook  In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, the meeting participants—the 4 members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks, all of whom particip ated in the deliberations—submitted their assessments of real output growth, the unemployment rate, inflation, and the target federal funds rate for each year from 2014 through 2016 and over the longer run, under each participant’s judgment of appropriate monetary policy."
"The longerrun projections represent each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy."
" Minutes of the Meeting of March 18–19, 2014Page 5_____________________________________________________________________________________________In their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, participants generally noted that data released since their January meeting had indicated somewhat slowerthan-expected growth in economic activity during the winter months, in part reflecting adverse weather conditions."
" Inflation had continued to run below the Committee’s longerrun objective, but longerterm inflation expectations had remained stable."
" Several participants indicated that recent economic news, although leading them to mark down somewhat their estimates of economic growth in late 2013 as well as  their assessments of likely growth in the first quarter of 2014, had not prompted a significant revision of their projections of moderate economic growth over coming quarters."
Most participants noted that unusually severe winter weather had held down economic activity during the early months of the year.
 Participants expected economic activity to pick up as the weatherrelated disruptions to spending and production dissipated.
" A few participants, however, highlighted factors other than weather that had likely contributed to the slowdown during the first quarter, including slower growth in net exports following its unusually large positive contribution to growth in the four th quarter of 2013."
" Moreover, it was noted that some of the pickup in economic growth that had appeared to have been indicated by the data available at the January meeting had been reversed by subsequent data revisions."
" For many participants, the outlook for economic activity over coming quarters had changed little, on balance, since the time of the December meeting."
" Although unfavora ble weather had contributed to the recent disappointing performance of housing, a few participants suggested that last year’s rise in mortgage interest rates might have produced a largerthan-expected reduction in home sales."
 Slackening demand from institutional investors was ci ted as another factor behind the decline in home sales.
" Nonetheless, the underlying fundamentals, including population growth and household formation, were viewed as pointing to a continuing recovery of  the housing market."
" The unemployment rate had moved down in recent months, as had broader measures of unemployment and underemployment."
" Going fo rward, participants continued to expect a gradual decline in the unemployment rate over the medium term, with judgments differing somewhat across participants about the likely pace of the decline."
 It was also noted that uncertainty about the trend rate of productivity growth was making it difficult to ascertain the rate of real GDP growth that would be associated with progress in reducing the unemployment rate.
"While there was general agreement that slack remains in the labor market, participants expressed a range of views regarding the amount of slack and how well the unemployment rate performs as a summary indicator of labor market conditions."
 Several participants pointed to a number of factors—including the low labor force participation rate and the stillhigh rates of longerduration unemployment and of workers employed part time for economic reasons —as suggesting that there might be considerably more  labor market slack than indicated by the unemployment rate alone.
" A couple of other participants, however, saw reasons to believe that slack was more limited, viewing the decline in the participation rate as primarily reflecting demographic trends with little role for cyclical factors and observing that broader measures of unemployment had registered declines in the past year that were comparable with the decline in the standard meas ure."
 Several participants cited  low nominal wage growth as pointing to the existence of continued labor market slack.
 Participants also noted the debate in the research literature and elsewhere concerning whether longterm unemployment differs materially from shortterm unemployment in its implications for wage and price pressures.
Inflation continued to run below the Committee’s        2 percent longerrun objective over the intermeeting period.
 A couple of participants expressed concern that inflation might not return to 2 percent in the next few years and suggested that a protracted period of inflation below 2 percent raised questions about whether the Committee was providing an appropriate degree of monetary accommodation.
 One of these Page 6Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________participants suggested that persistently low inflation was a clear reflection of a sizable shortfall of employment from its maximum level.
 A number of participants noted that a pickup in nominal wage growth would be consistent with labor market conditions moving closer to normal and would support the return of consumer price inflation to the Committee’s 2 percent longerrun goal.
" However, a couple of other participants suggested that factors other than economic slack had played a notable role in holding down inflation of late, including unusually slow growth in prices of medical services."
" Most participants expected inflation to return to 2 percent over the next few years, supported by stable inflation expectations and the continued gradual recovery in economic activity."
" It  was suggested that slower growth in China had likely already put some downward pressure on world commodity prices, and a couple of participants observed that a largerthan-expected slowdown in economic growth in China could have adverse implications for global economic growth."
" In addition, it was noted that events in Ukraine were likely to have little direct effect on the U.S. economic outlook but might have negative implications for global growth if they escalated and led to a protracted period of geopolitical tensions in that region."
" A couple of participants pointed to the decline in credit spre ads to relatively low levels by historical standards; one of these participants noted the risk of either a sharp ri se in spreads, which could have negative repercussions for aggregate demand, or a continuation of the decline in spreads, which could undermine financial stability over time."
 Another participant stressed the growth in consumer credit to less creditworthy households.
"In their discussion of monetary policy going forward, participants focused primar ily on possible changes to the Committee’s forward guidance for the federal funds rate."
" Almost all participants agreed that it was appropriate at this meeting to update the forward guidance, in part because the unemployment rate was seen as likely to fall below its 6½ percent threshold value before long."
" One participant, however, favored retaining the existing threshold language on the grounds that removing it before the unemployment rate reached 6½ percent could be misinterpreted as a signal that the path of policy going forward would be less accommodative."
 Another participant favored introducing new quantitative thresholds of 5½ percent for the unemployment rate and 2¼ percent for projected inflation.
 A few participants proposed adding new language in which the Committee would indicate its willingness to keep rates low if projected inflation remained persistently below the Committee’s 2 percent longerrun objective; these participants suggested that the inclusion of this quantitative element in the forward guidance would demonstrate the Committee’s commitment to defend its inflation objective from below as well as from above.
" Other participants, however, judged  that it was already well understood that the Committee recognizes that inflation persistently below it s 2 percent objective could pose risks to economic performance."
" For example, the statement could indicate that the Committee currently anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near mandateconsistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run."
 Participants observed that a number of factors were likely to have contributed to a persistent decline in the level of interest rates consistent with attaining and maintaining the Committee’s objectives.
" In particular, participants cited higher precautionary savings by U.S. households following the financial crisis, higher global levels of savings, demographic changes, sl ower growth in potential output, and continued restra int on the availability of credit."
"Committee Policy Action Committee members saw the information received over the intermeeting period as indicating that growth in economic activity  slowed during the winter months, in part reflecting adverse weather conditions."
" The unemployment rate, however, remained elevated when judged against members’ estimates of the longerrun normal rate of unemployment."
" Fiscal policy was restraining economic growth, although the extent of restraint had diminished."
" Inflation was running below the Committee’s longerrun objective, and this was seen as posing possible risks to economic performance, but members anticipated that stable inflation expectations and strengthening economic activity would, over time, return inflation to the Committee’s   2 percent objective."
" However, in light of their concerns about the possible persistence of low inflation, members agreed that inflation developments should be monitored carefully for evidence that inflation was moving back toward the Committee’s longerrun objective."
"In their discussion of monetary policy in the period ahead, members agreed that there was sufficient underlying strength in the broader economy to support ongoing improvement in labor market conditions."
" In light of the cumulative progress toward maximum employment and the improvement in the outlook for labor market conditions since the inception of the current asset purchase program, members decided that it would be appropriate to make a further measured reduction in the pace of its asset purchases at this meeting."
 Members also underscored that the pace of asset purchases was not on a preset course and would remain contingent on the Committee’s outlook for the labor market and inflation as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of purchases.
" While making a further measured reduction in its pace of purchases, the Committee emphasized that its holdings of longerterm securities were sizable and would still be increasing, which would promote a stronger economic recovery by maintaining downward pressure on longer -term interest rates, supporting mortgage markets, and helping to make broader financial conditions more accommodative."
"With respect to forward guidance about the federal funds rate, all members judged that, as the unemployment rate was likely to fall below 6½ percent before long, it was appropriate to replace the existing quantitative thresholds at this meeting."
" Almost all members Page 8Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________judged that the new language should be qualitative in nature and should indicate that, in determining how long to maintain the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee would assess progress, both realized  and expected, toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation."
" However, a couple of members preferred to include language in the statement indicating that the Committee would keep rates low if projected inflation remained persistently below the Committee’s 2 percent longerrun objective."
 One of these members argued that the Committee should continue to provide quantitative thresholds for both the unemployment rate and inflation.
" The Committee decided that it was appropriate to add language indicating that the Committee currently anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near mandateconsistent levels, economic conditions  may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run."
" It was also noted that the postmeeting statements, rather than the SEP, provide the public with information on the Committee’s monetary policy decisions and that it was therefore appropriate for the postmeeting statement to convey the Committee’s position on the likely future behavior of the federal funds rate."
"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct  the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: “Consistent with its st atutory mandate, the Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster maximum employment and price stability."
" The System Open Market Account Manager and the Secretary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the System’s balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the Committee’s objectives of maximum employment and price stability.” The vote encompassed appr oval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p.m.: “Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in January indicates that growth in economic activity slowed during the winter months, in part reflecting adverse weather conditions."
" The unemployment rate, however, remains elevated."
" Fiscal policy is restraining economic growth, although the extent of restraint is diminishing."
" Inflation has been running below the Committee’s longerrun objective, but longerterm inflation expectations have remained stable."
"Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
" The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor Minutes of the Meeting of March 18–19, 2014Page 9_____________________________________________________________________________________________market conditions will continue to improve gradually, moving toward those the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate."
" The Committee recognizes that inflation persistently below its 2 percent objective could pose risks to economic performance, and it is monitoring inflation developments carefully for evidence that inflation will move back toward its objective over the medium term."
" In light of the cumulative progress toward maximum employment and the improvement in the outlook for labor market conditions since the inception of the current asset purchase program, the Committee decided to make a further measured reduction in the pace of its asset purchases."
" The Committee’s sizable and stillincreasing holdings of longerterm securities should maintain downward pressure on longerterm interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative, which in turn should promote a stronger economic recovery and help to ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with the Committee’s dual mandate."
" If incoming information broadly supports the Committee’s expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back toward its longerrun objective, the Committee will likely reduce the pace of asset purchases in further measured steps at future meetings."
" However, asset purchases are not on a preset course, and the Committee’s decisions about their pace will remain contingent on the Committee’s outlook for the labor market and inflation as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases."
"To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee today reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy remains appropriate."
" In determining how long to maintain the current 0 to         ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess progress—both realized and expected—toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation."
" This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments."
" The Committee continues to anticipate, based on its assessment of these fact ors, that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee’s 2 percent longerrun goal, and provided that longerterm inflation expectations remain well anchored."
"When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longerrun goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent."
" The Committee currently anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near mandateconsistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Page 10Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________Committee views as normal in the longer run."
"With the unemployment rate  nearing         6½ percent, the Committee has updated its forward guidance."
"Mr. Kocherlakota dissented because, in his view, the new forward guidance in the fifth paragraph of the statement would weaken the credibility of the Committee’s commitment to its inflation goal by failing to communicate purposeful steps to more rapidly increase inflation to the 2 percent target and by suggesting that the Committee views inflation persistently below          2 percent as an acceptable outcome."
" Moreover, he judged that the new guidance would act as a drag on economic activity because it provided little information about the desired rate of progress toward maximum employment and no quantitative measure of what constitutes maximum employme nt, and thus would generate uncertainty about the extent to which the Committee is willing to use monetary stimulus to foster faster growth."
 Mr. Kocherlakota st rongly endorsed the sixth paragraph of the statement because providing information about the Committee’s intentions for the federal funds rate once employment and inflation are near mandateconsistent levels should help stimulate economic activity by reducing uncertainty.
 The Committee discussed possible changes to its forward guidance that could provide additional information about the factors likely to enter its decisions regarding the federal funds rate target as the unemployment rate approached its 6½ percent threshold and once that threshold was crossed.
" Participants agreed that the existing forward guidance, with its reference to a 6½ percent threshold for the unemployment rate, was becoming outdated as the unemployment rate continued its expected gradual decline."
" Most participants felt that the quantitative thresholds had been very us eful in communicating policy intentions when employment was far from mandate-consistent levels, but, with the economy having moved appreciably closer to maximum employment, the forward guidance should emphasize that the Committee is focusing more on a broader set of economic indicators."
" Thus, most part icipants felt that quantitative thresholds, triggers, or floors should not be a part of future statement language, with a number of participants noting the uncertainty associated with defining and measuring the unemployment rate and the level of employment that would be most consistent with the Committee’s maximum employment objective, or other similar concepts."
" One participant favored linking the length of time that the federal funds rate would remain at the lower bound to the period over which complete recovery of the labor market was projected to occur, while another advocated qualitative forward guidance expressed in terms of the Committee’s projections of real output growth, arguing that such an approach would avoid the uncertainties associated with estimates of potential output or maximum Minutes of the Meeting of March 18–19, 2014Page 11_____________________________________________________________________________________________employment."
 A few participants saw merit in stating explicitly that the Committee would provide accommodation to the extent necessary to prevent inflation from running persistently below its 2 percent longerrun goal.
 One of these participants argued that such forward guidance would strengthen the cred ibility of the Committee’s inflation objective as well as encourage employment outcomes that were most consistent with the Committee’s other objective of maximum employment.
" Another participant suggested that the Committee state that it would adjust policy to keep projected inflation near 2 percent over the medium term, and that it would balance deviations from its objectives in the near term."
" One participant favored including a reference in the statement to “financial conditions,” rather than “financial stability,” emphas izing that, when factors other than monetary policy induce a change in financial conditions, the Committee may need to take that change in financial conditio ns into account when making its monetary policy decisions."
"English Secretary  Page 12Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________Summary of Economic Projections In conjunction with the March 18–19, 2014, Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, meeting participants—the 4 members of the Board of Governors and the 12 presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks, all of whom particip ated in the deliberations—submitted their assessments of real output growth, the unemployment rate, inflation, and the target federal funds rate for each year from 2014 through 2016 and over the longer run."
 Each participant’s assessment was based on information available at the time of the meeting plus his or her judgment of appropriate monetary policy and assumptions about the factors likely to affect economic outcomes.
" The longerrun projections represent each participant’s judgment of the value to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy."
 “Appropriate monetary policy” is defined as the future path of policy that each participant deems most likely to foster outcomes for econom ic activity and inflation that best satisfy his or her individual interpretation of the Federal Reserve’s objectives of maximum employment and stable prices.
"Overall, FOMC participants expected that, under appropriate monetary policy, economic growth would pick up this year and next, before moving down a bit but remaining above its long errun rate in 2016, and that the unemployment rate would decline gradually toward its longerrun normal level over the projection period (table 1 and figure 1)."
" Almost all of the participants projected that inflation, as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), would rise steadily to a level at or slightly below the Committee’s 2 percent objective in 2016."
Most participants expected that highly accommodative monetary policy would remain  warranted over the next few years to foster progre ss toward the Federal Reserve’s longerrun objectives.
"Most participants saw the uncertainty associated with their outlooks for economic growth and the unemployment rate as similar to that of the past 20 years, and a majority saw the uncertainty associated with their projections for inflation as similar to that of the past  20 years."
" In addition, most participants considered the risks to the outlook for re al gross domestic product (GDP), the unemployment rate, and inflation to be broadly balanced, although so me saw the risks to their Table 1."

"The Outlook for Economic Activity Participants generally projected that, conditional on their individual assumptions about appropriate monetary policy, real GDP growth would pick up gradually this year and next to a pace somewhat exceeding their estimates of the longerrun normal rate of output growth."
" Subsequently, in 2016, real GDP growth was projected to begin to move back toward its longerrun rate."
" Most participants revised down a bit their projections of real GDP growth for 2014, compared with their projections in Decemb er 2013, and the top end of the central tendencies for output growth in each year and over the longer run moved down slightly."
" Nonetheless, participants pointed to a number of factors that they expected would contribute to a pickup in economic growth this year, such as an easing of the headwinds that have been weighing on growth, including diminished restraint from fiscal policy; rising household net worth and highly accommodative monetary policy also were expected to contribute."
" The central tendencies of participants’ projections for real GDP growth were 2.8 to 3.0 percent in 2014, 3.0 to 3.2 percent in 2015, and 2.5 to 3.0 percent in 2016."
 The central tendency for the longerrun normal rate of growth of real GDP was 2.2 to 2.3 percent.
Participants anticipated a gradual decline in the unemployment rate over the projection period.
" The central tendencies of participants’ forecasts for the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of each year were 6.1 to 6.3 percent in 2014, 5.6 to 5.9 percent in 2015, and    5.2 to 5.6 percent in 2016."
" Nearly all participants revised down their projected paths for the unemployment rate relative to their December projections, with some pointing to the decline in the unemployment rate in recent months."
" The cent ral tendency of participants’ estimates of the longerrun normal rate of unemployment that would prevail under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy also moved lower, to 5.2 to 5.6 percent."
 A majority of participants projected that the unemployment rate would be close to their individual estimates of its longerrun level at the end of 2016.
 Figures 3.A and 3.B show th at participants continued to hold a range of views regarding the likely outcomes for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate over the next two years.
" The diversity of views reflected their individual assessments of the rate at which the headwinds that have been holding back the pace of the economic recovery would abate, the anticipated path for foreign economic activity, the trajectory for growth in household net worth, and the appropriate path of monetary policy."
" Relative to December, the dispersions of participants’ projections for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate over the period from 2014 to 2016 narrowed slightly."
"The Outlook for Inflation Participants’ views on the broad outlook for inflation under the assumption of appropriate monetary policy were nearly unchanged, on balance, from those in their December projections."
"All participants anticipated that, on average, both headline and core inflation would rise gradually over the next few years, and a large majority of participants expected headline inflation to be at or slightly below the Committee’s 2 percent objective in 2016."
" Specifically, the central  tendencies for PCE inflation were 1.5 to 1.6 percen t in 2014, 1.5 to 2.0 percent in 2015, and 1.7 to 2.0 percent in 2016."
 The central tendencies of the forecasts for core inflation were broadly similar to those for the headline measure.
 A number of participants viewed the combination of stable inflation expectations and steadily diminishing resource slack as likely to contribute to a gradual rise of inflation back toward the Committee’s longerrun objective.
Figures 3.C and 3.D provide information on the diversity of participants’ views about the outlook for inflation.
 The ranges of participants’ projections for overall inflation were little changed relative to December.
 The forecasts for PCE inflation in 2016 were at or below the Committee’s longerrun objective.
" Similar to the projections for headline inflation, the projections for core inflation in 2016 were also concentrated near        2 percent."
"Appropriate Monetary Policy As indicated in figure 2, mo st participants judged that very low levels of the federal funds rate would remain appropriate for the next few years."
 All participants but one projected that the unemployment rate would be below 6 percent at the end of the year in which they currently anticipate that it will become appropriate to raise the federal funds rate above its effective lower bound.

 Most participants projected that the unemployment rate would remain above their estimates of its longerrun normal level at the end of the year in which they saw the federal funds rate increasing from its effective lower bound.
" Almost all participants expected that the federal funds rate at the end of 2016 would still be below their individual asse ssments of its longerrun level, with many pointing to subdued inflation pressures, belowmandate inflatio n, the stillnoticeable effects of headwinds, or the need to maintain low rates to support the recovery as reasons to keep the federal funds rate low at that time."
" Estimates of the longerrun target for the federal funds rate ranged from 3½ to about 4¼ percent, reflecting the Committee’s inflation objective of 2 percent and participants’ individual judgments about the appropriate longerrun level of the real federal funds rate in the absence of further shocks to the economy."
"Participants’ views of the appropriate path for monetary policy were informed by their judgments about the state of the economy, includ ing the values of the unemployment rate and other la bor market indicators that would be consistent with maximum employment, the extent to which the economy was currently falling short of maximum employment, the prospects for inflation to reach the Committee’s longerterm objective of 2 percent, and the balance of risks around the outlook."
 A couple of participants al so mentioned using various monetary policy rules to guide their thinking on the appropriate path for the federal funds rate.
"Uncertainty and Risks Nearly all participants continued to judge the levels of uncertainty about their projections for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate as broadly similar to the norm during the previous 20 years (figure 4).1  As in December, most participants continued to judge the risks to real GDP growth and the unemployment rate to be broadly balanced."
" Two participants viewed risks to output growth as weighted to the downside, reflecting their concerns about possible geopolitical developments and the strength of external demand."
"                                                    1 Table 2 provides estimates of the forecast uncertainty for the change in real GDP, the unemployment rate, and total consumer price inflation over  the period from 1994 through 2013."

 The majority of participants continued to judge the levels of uncertainty associated with their forecasts for the two inflation measures to be broadly similar to historical norms and the risks to those projections to be broadly balanced.
" Five participants, however, saw the risks to their inflation forecasts as tilted to the downside, reflecting, for example, the possibility that the current low levels of inflation could prove more persistent than anticipated as well as elevated global risks to the outlook."
" Conversely, one participant cited upside risks to inflation stemming from uncertainty about the timing and efficacy of the Committee’s withdrawal of accommodation."
    Page 12Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________       Forecast Uncertainty    The economic projections provided by the members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks inform discussions of monetary policy among policymakers and can aid public understanding of the basis for policy actions.
" Thus, in setting the stance of monetary policy, participants consider no t only what appears to be the most likely economic outcome as embodied in their projections, but also the range of alternative possibilities, the likelihood of their occurring, and the potential costs to the economy should they occur."
"Table 2 summarizes the average historical accuracy of a range of forecasts, including those reported in past Monetary Policy Report s and those prepared by the Federal Reserve Board’s staff in advance of meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee."
" The corresponding 70 percent confidence intervals for overall inflation would be 1.1 to  2.9 percent in the current year, 1.0 to 3.0 percent in the second year, and 0.9 to 3.1 percent in the third year."
"As with real activity and inflation, the outlook for the future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable uncertainty."
 This uncertainty arises primarily because each participant’s assessment of the appropriate stance of monetary policy depends importantly on the evolution of real activity and inflation over time.
