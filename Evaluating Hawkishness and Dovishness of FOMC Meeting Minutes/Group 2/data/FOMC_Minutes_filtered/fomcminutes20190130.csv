"Rudd, Senior Adviser, Division of Research and Statistics, Board of Governors   2 Attended through the discussion of the long -run monetary policy implementation frameworks."
Adjust somewhat in exceptional circumstances the stance of monetary policy and to take actions that may resul t in material changes in the composition and size of the assets in the SOMA; or  B.
" Any such adjustment described in subparagraph A of this paragraph  5 shall be made in the context of the Committee’s discussion and decision about the stance of policy at its most recent meeting and the Committee’s longrun objectives to f oster maximum employment and price stability, and shall be based on economic, financial, and monetary developments since the most recent meeting of the Committee."
" __________________________  1 In general, as specified in Article IV, each member of the IMF undertakes to collaborate with the IMF and other members to assure orderly exchange arrangements and to promote  a stable system of exchange rates."
 These obligations include seeking to direct the member’s economic and financial policies toward the objective of fostering orderly economic growth with reasonable price stability.
 These obligations also include avoidin g manipulating exchange rates or the international monetary system in such a way that would impede effective balance of payments adjustment or to give an unfair competitive advantage over other members.
"  In the Committee’s annual reconsideration of the Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, participants agreed that only a minor revision was required at this meeting, which was to update the reference to the median of FOMC participants’ estimates of the longer -run normal rate of unemployment from 4.6 percent  to 4.4 percent ."
"  STATEMENT ON LONGER -RUN GOALS AND MONETARY POLICY STRATEGY  (As amended effective January 29, 2019)  The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is firmly committed to fulfilling its statutory mandate from the Congress of promoting maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long -term interest rates."
 The Committee seeks to explain its monetary policy  decisions to the public as clearly as possible.
" Such clarity facilitates well -informed decisionmaking by households and businesses, reduces economic and financial uncertainty, increases the effectiveness of monetary policy, and enhances transparency and accountability, which are essential in a democratic society."
" Inflation, employment, and long -term interest rates fluctuate over time in response to economic and financial disturbances."
" Moreover, monetary policy actions tend to influence economic activity and prices with a lag."
" The inflation rate over the longer run is primarily determined by monetary policy, and hence the Committee has the ability to specify a longer -run goal for inflation."
" The Committee reaffirms its judgment that inflation at the rate of 2  percen t, as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, is most consistent over the longer run with the Federal Reserve’s statutory mandate."
 The Committee would be concerned if inflation were running persistently above or below this objective.
" Communicating Page 8Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________this symmetric inflation goal clearly to the public helps keep longer -term inflation expectations firmly anchored, thereby fostering price stability and moderate long -term interest rates and enhancing the Committee ’s ability to promote maximum employment in the face of significant economic disturbances."
 The maximum level of employment is largely determined by nonmonetary factors that affect the structure and dynamics of the labor market.
" Consequently, it would not be appropriate to specify a fixed goal for employment; rather, the Committee’s policy decisions must be informed by assessments of the maximum level of employment, recognizing that su ch assessments are necessarily uncertain and subject to revision."
 Information about Committee participants’ estimates of the longer -run normal rates of output growth and unemployment is published four times per year in the FOMC’s Summary of Economic Projections.
" For example, in the most recent projections, the median of FOMC participants’ estimates of the longer -run normal rate of unemployment was 4.4  percent ."
" In setting monetary policy, the Committee seeks to mitigate deviations of inflation from its longer -run goal and deviations of employment from the Committee’s assessments of its maximum level."
" However, under circumstances in which the Committee judges that the objectives are not complementary, it follows a balanced approach in promoting them, taking into account the magnitude of the deviations and the potentially different time horizons over which employment and inflation a re projected to return to levels judged consistent with its mandate."
" Market participants pointed to a number of factors as contributing to the heightened volatility and sustained declines in risk asset pr ices and interest rates  over recent months  including a weaker outlook and greater uncertainties for foreign economies  (particularly for Europe and China), perceptions of greater policy risks, and the partial shutdown of the federal government."
" In other markets, repurchase agreement (repo) rates spiked at year -end, reportedly reflecting strong demands for financing from dealers associated with large Treasury auction net settlements on that day combined with a cutback in the supply of financing available from banks and others managing the size of their balance sheets over year -end for reporting purposes."
Long -Run Monetary Policy Implementation Frameworks  Committee participants resumed their discussion from the December 2018 meeting of the appropriate long -run framework for monetary policy implementation.
" The staff noted that the Committee ha d previously indicated that, in the longer run, it intends to operate with no more securities holdings than necessary to implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively."
" In considering the effectiveness of the operating regime, the staff observed tha t over recent years, the Federal Reserve ha d been able to implement monetary policy  in an environment with ample reserves by adjusting administered rates—including the rates on required and excess reserve balances and the offered rate at the overnight reverse repurchase agreement facility —without needing to actively manage the supply of reserves."
 The staff briefing also included a discussion of  factors relevant in judging the  level of rese rves that would support the efficient implementation of monetary policy .
 The staff suggested that maintaining a buffer of reserves above  the minimum quantity that corresponds  to the flat portion of the reserve demand curve  could reduce  the size and frequency of open market operations needed to maintain good control of the policy rate .
" Against this backdrop,  the staff presented options for  substantially  slowing the decline in reserves by ending the reduction in asset holdings at some point over the latter half of this year and thereafter holding the size of the SOMA portfolio roughly constant for a time  so that  Page 10Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________the average level of reserves would fall at a very gradual pace reflecting the trend growth in other Federal Reserve liabilities."
" In particular, t he level and variability of reserve demand and supply w ere likely to be much larger than in the period before  the crisis , and stabilizing the policy rate in this environment would require large and frequent open market operations."
" Participants observed that, although the target range for the federal funds rate was the Committee’s primary means of adjusting the stance of policy, the balance sheet normalization process should proceed in a way that supports the achievement of the Federal Reserve’s dual -mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices."
" A substantial majority expected that when asset redemptions ended, the level of reserves would likely be somewhat larger than necessary  for efficient and effective implementation of monetary policy; if so, many suggested that some further very gradual decline in the average level of reserves , reflecting the trend growth of other liabilities such as Federal Reserve notes in circulation , could be appropriate ."
" In these participants’ view, t his process would allow the Federal Reserve to arrive slowly at an efficient  level of reserves while maintaining good control of short -term interest rates  without needing to engage in more frequent open market operations ."
" A few participants judged that there would be little benefit to allowing reserves to continue to fall afte r the end of redemptions or that this approach could have costs, such as an undue risk of volatility in short -term interest rates , that would exceed its benefits ."
" These participants thought that upon ending asset redemptions, the Federal Reserve should begin adding to its assets to offset growth in nonreserve liabilities, so as to keep the average level of reserves relatively stable."
" Following the discussion, the Chairman proposed that the Committee communicate its intentions regarding monetary policy implementation and its willingness to adjust the details of its balance sheet normalization program by publishing a statement at the conclusion of the meeting."
" STATEMENT REGARD ING MONETARY POLICY IMPLEMENTATION  AND BALANCE SHEET NORMALIZATION  (Adopted January 30, 2019)  After extensive deliberations and thorough review of experience to date, the Committee judges that it is appropriate at this time to provide additional information regarding its plans to implement monetary policy                                                            5 The Committee’s Policy Normalization Principles and Plans were adopted on September 16, 2014, and are available at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_PolicyNormalization.pdf ."
" Additionally, the Committee is revising its earlier guidance regarding the conditions under which it could adjust the details of its balance sheet normalization program.5  Accordingl y, all participants agreed to the following:  • The Committee intends to continue to implement monetary policy in a regime in which an ample supply of reserves ensures that control over the level of the federal funds rate and other shortterm interest rates i s exercised primarily through the setting of the Federal Reserve's administered rates, and in which active management of the supply of reserves is not required."
  • The Committee continues to view changes in the target range for the federal funds rate as its primary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy.
" Moreover, the Committee would be prepared to use its full range of tools, including altering the size and composition of its balance sheet, if future economic conditions were to warrant a more accommodative monetary policy than can be achieved solely by reducing the federal funds rate."
"  Staff Review of t he Economic Situation  The information available for the January 29 –30 meeting indicated that labor market conditions continued to strengthen and that growth in real gross domestic product (GDP) was solid in the fourth quarter of last year, although the ava ilability of data was more limited than usual because of the partial federal government shutdown  that extended from December 22 to January 25 ."
" Consumer price inflation, as measured by the 12month percent age change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), was a bit below 2 percent  in November, held down in part by recent declines in consumer energy prices."
Page 12Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________measures of longer -run inflation expectations were little change d.
Total nonfarm payroll employment expanded strongly in December.
" The national unemployment rate edged up but was still at a low level of 3.9  percent , while the labor force participation rate also increased somewhat; as a result, the employment -topopula tion ratio remained steady in December."
" The unemployment rates for African Americans, Asians, and Hispanics in December were below their levels at the end of the previous economic expansion, although persistent differentials in unemployment rates across groups remained."
 The rates of private -sector job openings and quits edged down in November but were still at high levels; initial claims f or unemployment insurance benefits through the middle of January were near historically low levels.
" Output gains were strong in the manufacturing and mining sectors, while the output of utilities declined , with warmer -thanusual temperatures lowering the demand for heating."
" Household spending looked to have increased strongly in the fourth quarter, as real PCE growth was strong in October and November."
" The release of the retail sales report for December was delayed, but available indicators—such as credit card  and debit card transaction data and light motor vehicle sales —suggested that household spending growth remained strong in December."
 Key factors that influence consumer spending —including ongoing gains in real disposable personal income and stillelevated measures of households’ net worth —continued to be supportive of solid re al PCE growth in the near term.
" Real residential investment appear ed to have declined again in the fourth quarter, likely reflecting in part decreases in the affordability of housing arising from both the net increase in mortgage interest rates over the past year and ongoing, though somewhat slower,  house price appreciat ion."
 Growth in real private expenditures for business equipment and intellectu al property looked to have picked up solidly in the fourth quarter.
" Nominal defense spending in October and November pointed to solid growth in real federal purchases, although spending data for December were  delayed."
 The available data for October suggested that the contribution of the change in net exports to real GDP growth in the fourth quarter would be much less negative than the drag of nearly 2  percentage points in the third quarter.
" Core PCE price inflation, which _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of January 29–30, 2019Page 13excludes changes in consumer food and energy prices, was 1.9  percent  over that same period."
" The consumer price index (CPI) rose 1.9  percent  over the 12 months ending in December, while core CPI inflation was 2.2 percent ."
 Recent readings on survey -based measures of longer -run inflation expectations —including those from the Michigan survey and the Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants —were little changed.
 Recent data suggested that fore ign economic growth was subdued in the fourth quarter relative to earlier in the year.
" In the advanced foreign economies (AFEs), especially the euro area, indicators of economic activity weakened further, though they remained consistent with positive econ omic growth."
" In the emerging market economies (EMEs), growth in Mexico and Brazil appeared to have slowed to a modest pace in the fourth quarter after a temporary pickup in the third quarter."
" Foreign inflation fell in the fourth quarter, largely reflecting lower oil prices."
" Inflation pressures, especially in some AFEs, generally remained muted."
 The 5year and 5 -to10-yearforward inflation compensation measures based on Treasury InflationProtected Securities ( TIPS ) edged down a bit over the period; both measures were down significantly from levels prevailing in the fall of last year.
" Growth of C&I loans on banks’ balance sheets picked up in the fourth quarter, reflecting stronger originations as well as reduced paydowns and loan sales."
 CRE loan growth at banks continued to expand at a pace comparable with that seen over the course of 2018.
" Banks in the January SLOOS reported that demand was unchanged, on net, in the fourth quarter for nonfarm nonresidential loans, the largest CRE loan category, while demand was reportedly weaker for multifamily loans and construction loans."
"  In consumer credit markets, financing conditions tightened a bit but, on balance, remained generally supportive of growth in household spending."
" Staff Economic Outlook  The U.S. economic forecast prepared by the staff for the January FOMC meeting was revised down a little, on balance, primarily reflecting somewhat lower projected _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of January 29–30, 2019Page 15paths for domestic equity prices and foreign economic growth."
" The staff estimated  that U.S. real GDP growth was solid in the fourth quarter of last year, bolstered by consumer spending and business investment, and that the effects of the partial federal government shutdown were quite small in that quarter."
" Real GDP growth was expected to slow but remain solid in the first half of this year, with the effects of the partial federal government shutdown modestly restraining GDP growth in the first quarter and those effects being reversed in the second quarter."
" In the medium term, real GDP growth in 2019 was forecast to be at a rate above the staff’s estimate of potential output growth, step down to the growth rate of potential output next year and then slow further to a pace below potential output growth in 2021."
 The unemployment rate was projected to decline somewhat further below the staff’s estimate of its longer -run natural rate but to bottom out by the end of this year and begin to edge up in 2021.
" With labor market conditions judged to already be tight, the staff continued to assume that projected employment gains would manifest in smaller -thanusual downward pressure on the unemployment rate and in larger -thanusual upward pressure on the labor force participation rate."
      The staff’s forecast for inflation was little revised for the January FOMC meeting.
 Core PCE price inflation was still expected to step up to 2  percent  over this year as a whole and then to run at that level through the medium term.
" Total PCE price inflation was forecast to be a little below core inflation this year and next, reflecting projected declines in energy prices, and then to run at the same level as core inflation in  2021."
"  The staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as similar to the average of the past 20 years."
 The staff also saw the risks to the forecasts for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate as roughly balanced.
" On the downside, trade policies and foreign economic developments co uld move in directions that have significant negative effects on U.S. economic growth."
 Risks to the inflation projection also were seen as balanced.
" The upside risk that inflation could increase more than expected in an economy that was projected to move  further above its potential was counterbalanced by the downside risk that longer -term inflation expectations may be lower than was assumed in the staff forecast, as well as the possibility that the dollar could appreciate if foreign economic conditions de teriorated ."
Participants ’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook  Participants agreed that over the intermeeting period the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising at a solid rate.
" Job gains had been strong, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate had remained low."
" Household spending had continued to grow strongly, while growth of business fixed investment had moderated from its rapid pace earlier last year."
" On a 12 -month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy had remained near 2  percent ."
" Although market-based measures of inflation compensation had moved lower in recent months, survey -based measures of longer -term inflation exp ectations were little changed."
" Participants continued to view a sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee’s symmetric 2  percent  objective as the most likely outcomes  over the next few years ."
" Participants generally continued to expect the growth rate of real GDP in 2019 to step down somewhat from the pace seen over 2018 to a rate closer to their estimates of long errun growt h, with a few participants commenting that waning fiscal stimulus was expected to contribute to the step -down ."
" Several  participants commented that they had nudged down their outlook s for output growth since the December meeting, citing a softening in consumer or business sentiment, a reduction in the outlook for foreign economic  growth, or the tightening in financial conditions that  had occurred in recent months."
" In their discussion of the household sector, participants noted that recent data on spending had been strong, supported by a strong job market and rising incomes ."
  Participants noted that growth of business fixed investment had moderated from its rapid pace earlier last year.
" Concerns about the economic outlook we re variously attributed to uncertainty or worries about slowing global economic growth, including in Europe and China; trade policy; waning fiscal policy stimulus; and the partial government shutdown."
   Participants observed that both overall inflation  and inflation for items other than food and energy remained near 2 percent  on a 12 -month basis.
 Participants continued to view inflation near the Committee ’s symmetric 2 percent  objective as the most likely outcome.
" Some  participants noted that some factors, such as the decline in oil prices , slower growth and softer inflation abroad,  or appreciation of the dollar last year, had held down some recent inflation readings and may continue to do so this year."
" In addition, many  participants commented that upward pressures on inflation appeared to be more muted than they appeared to be last year  despite strengthening labor market conditions and rising input costs for some industries."
"  In their discussion of indicators of inflation expectations, particip ants noted that market -based measures of inflation compensation had moved lower in recent months."
 Participants expressed a range of views in interpreting the decline in inflation compensation.
" On the  one hand, that decline could stem from a decrease  in expected inflation on the part of market participants ."
" In that case,  the current low levels of inflation compensation could suggest that inflation expectations are below the Committee’s 2 percent  inflation objective."
" On the other hand, the decline in inflation compensation might reflect  in large part declines in risk premiums or increased concerns about downside risks to the outlook for inflation."
" This interpretation was seen as consistent with the behavior of the most recent survey -based measures of expected inflation, which were little changed ."
" Estimates of job gains in the December employment report had been strong,  the unemployment rate had remained low , and the labor force participation rate had moved up."
 Some  participants commented on recent indicators at the national or District levels as suggesting a pickup in wage growth .
 The  pickup was  attributed to tightening in national or District labor market condition s or to gains in the rate of productivity  growth .
 Continued solid productivity growth was seen as a key factor necessary to support rising real wages  over time.
" Participants commented on a number of risks associated with their outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation over the medium term."
" Participants noted that some risks to the downside had increased, including the possibilities of a sharp erthan-expected slowdown in global economic growth, particularly in China and Europe, a rapid waning of fiscal policy  stimulus, or a further tightening of financial market  conditions ."
 A few  participants expressed concern that longer -run inflation expectations may be  lower than levels consistent with the Committee’s 2  percent  inflat ion objective.
 Several participants judged that risks that could lead to higher -thanexpected inflation had diminished relative to downside risks.
" Participants noted that financial asset prices appeared to be sensitive to information regarding trade policy  tensions, domestic fiscal and monetary policy, and global economic growth prospects."
" A couple  of _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of January 29–30, 2019Page 17participants noted that the rise in credit spreads over recent months, if it were to persist, could restrain future economic activity."
" In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, participants judged that information received since December indicated that real economic activity had been rising at a solid rate, labor market conditions had continued to strengthen, and inflation had been near the Committee’s objective."
" Participants generally expected economic activity to continue expanding at a solid pace in the period ahead, with strong  labor market conditions and inflation near 2  percent ."
" In addition , the global economy had continued to record slower growth, and consumer and business sentiment had deteriorated ."
" With re gard to the Committee’s postmeeting statement, p articipants supported a proposed change in the forward guidance language  that would replace the previous guidance referring to “some further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate” with an indication that, in light of “global economic and financial developments and muted inflation pressures,” the Committee would “be patient as it determines what future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate may be appropriate.”  Participants also supported a proposal to remove from the statement the characterization of risks to the economic outlook as “roughly balanced.”  Participants pointed to a variety of considerations that supported a patient approach to monetary policy at this juncture as an appropriate  step in managing  various risks  and uncertainties  in the outlook ."
" With regard to the domestic economic picture, additional data would help policymakers gauge  the trajectory of business and consumer sentiment, whether the recent softness in  core and total  inflation and inflation compensation would persist, and the effect of the tightening of financial conditions on aggregate demand ."
 A patient approach would have the added benefit of giving policymakers an opportunity to judge  the response of economic activity and inflation to the recent  steps taken  to normalize the stance of monetary policy.
" Moreover, inflation pressures were muted , and asset valuations were less stretched than they had been a few months earlier ."
 Many participants suggested that it was not yet clear  what adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate may be appropriate later this year; several  of these participants argued that rate increases might prove necessary only if inflation outcomes were higher than in the ir baseline outlook.
" Some participants noted that, while global economic and financial developments had been important factors leading to a patient monetary policy posture, those developments mattered because  they affected assessments of the policy rate path most consistent with achievement of the Committee’s dual -mandate goals of maximum employment and price stability."
" Many participants observed that if uncertainty abated, the Committee would need to reassess the characterization of monetary policy as “patient” and might then use  different statement language."
" However, some other participant s noted that the  policy rate projections in the SEP are a valuable component of the overall information provided about the monetary policy  outlook ."
"Committee Policy Action  In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that information received since the Committee met in December indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising at a solid rate ."
" Job gains had been strong, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate had remained low."
" Household spending had continued to grow strongly, while growth of business fixed investment had moderated from its rapid pace earlier last year."
" On a  12month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy remained near 2  percent ."
" Although market -based measures of inflation compensation had moved lower in recent months, survey -based measures of longer -term inflation e xpectations were little changed."
" In their consideration of the economic outlook, members noted that financial conditions had tightened, on net, since September, and that global growth had moderated; members also observed  that a number of uncertainties , including those pertaining to the evolution of policies of the U.S. and foreign government s, still awaited resolution."
" However, members continued to view sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee’s symmetric 2  percent  objective as the most likely outcomes for the U.S. economy in the period ahead."
" In light of global economic and financial developments and muted inflation pressures, the Committee c ould be patient as it determined what future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate may be appropriate to support these outcomes."
" After assessing current conditions and the outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, members decided to maintain the target range for  the federal funds rate at 2¼ to 2½  percent ."
" Members agreed that in determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee would assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to the Committee’s maximum employment and symmetric 2  percent  inflation objectives."
" They reiterated that this assessment would take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation  expectations, and readings on financial and int ernational developments ."
" More generally, members noted that decisions regarding near -term adjustments of the stance of monetary policy would appropriately remain dependent on the evolution of the outlook as informed by incoming data."
" With regard to the postmeeting statement, members agreed to change the characterization of recent growth in economic activity from “strong” to “solid,” consistent with incoming information that suggested that the pace of expansion of the U.S. economy had moderated somewhat sin ce late last year."
" The description of indicators of inflation expectations  was revised to recognize that the downward moves in marketbased measures of inflation compensation that occurred in recent months had been sustained , while also noting that survey -based measures of longer -term inflation expectations were little changed."
" Members also agreed to several adjustments in the description of the outlook for the economy _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of January 29–30, 2019Page 19and monetary policy."
" The statement language was revised to indicate that the Committee  continued to view sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near 2  percent  as “the most likely outcomes.”  Members also agreed to add a sentence indicating that, in light of “global economic and financial deve lopments and muted inflation pressures, the Committee will be patient as it determines what future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate may be appropriate to support these outcomes.”  This sentence was intended to convey the Committee ’s view that a patient and flexible approach was appropriate at this time as a way to manage risks while assessing incoming information bearing on the economic outlook."
 The Committee also directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve’s agency mortgage -backed securities transactions.”  The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00  p.m.: “Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in December indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has bee n rising at a solid rate.
" Job gains have been strong, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low."
" Household spending has continued to grow strongly, while growth of business fixed investment has moderated from its rapid pace  earlier last year."
" On a 12month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy remain near 2  percent ."
" Although market -based measures of inflation compensation have moved lower in recent months, survey -based measures of  longer -term inflation expectations are little changed."
" Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
" The Committee continues to view sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee’s symmetric 2  percent  objective as the most likely outcomes."
" In light of global  economic and financial developments and muted inflation pressures, the Committee will be patient as it determines what future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate may be appropriate to support these outcomes."
" In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2  percent  inflation objective."
" This assessm ent will take into account a wide range of Page 20Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.”  Voting for this action:  Jerome H."
" Consistent with the Committee’s decision to lea ve the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the Board of Governors voted unanimously to leave the interest rates on required and excess reserve balances unchanged at 2.40  percent  and voted unanimously to approve establishment of the primary c redit rate at the existing level of 3.00  percent , effective January 31, 2019."
