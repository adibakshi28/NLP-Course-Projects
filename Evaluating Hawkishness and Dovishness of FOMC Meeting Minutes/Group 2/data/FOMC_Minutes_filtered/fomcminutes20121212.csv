" In their discussion of the staff presentation, some participants asked about the possible consequences of the alternative purchase programs for the expected path of Federal Reserve remittances to the Treasury Department, and a few indicated the need for additional consideration of the implications of such purchases for the eventual normalization of the stance of monetary policy and the size and composition of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet."
Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information reviewed at the December 11–12 meeting indicated that economic activity continued to increase at a moderate pace in recent months.
" Employment expanded further, and the unemployment rate declined slightly, on ba lance, from September to November but was still elevated."
" Consumer price inflation slowed as consumer energy costs fell, while measures of longerrun inflation expectations remained stable."
"Private nonfarm employment increased at a slightly faster rate in October and November than in the third quarter, but government employment decreased somewhat."
" The unemployment rate declined to 7.7 percent in November, and the labor force participation rate in that month was at the same level as in the third quarter."
" The relatively large share of workers employed part time for economic reasons trended up a bit, on net, while the share of longduration unemployment in total unemployment was essentially flat and remained elevated."
 Initial claims for unemployment insurance were boosted in early November by the effects of Hurricane Sandy but returned within weeks to a level that was about the same as before the hurricane.
"The U.S. international trade deficit widened in October, and both exports and imports fell sharply from the previous month."
" Nearterm inflation expectations from the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers edged up, on balance, in November and early December, while longerterm inflat ion expectations in the survey were little changed and continued to run within the relatively narrow range that has prevailed for some time."
" Compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector increased slightly over the year ending in the third quarter, and with a moderate rise in productivity, unit  labor costs we re essentially unchanged."
 The employment cost index rose only a bit faster than the measure of compensation per hour over the same period.
"Economic activity abroad remained subdued, especially in the advanced foreign ec onomies."
" Economic activity in Japan also declined in the third quarter, and a sharp drop in exports restrained economic growth in Canada."
" In most countries, inflation was still well contained, and monetary policy abroad generally remained accommodative."
" In contrast, yields on intermediateand longterm nominal Treasury securities declined , on net, perhaps reflecting some increase in safehaven demand associated with concerns about the potential economic effects of a substantial tightening in fiscal policy."
 Indicators of inflation compensation derived from nominal and inflationprotected Treasury securities showed mixed changes and remained within the ranges observed over recent years.
" While respondents reported that the use of leverage by counterparties had remained basically unchanged, they noted greater demand for funding of various types of securitization products."
 Growth in C&I loans and consumer loans was offset by a decline in banks’ residential real estate loans.
 M2 growth was rapid in October but slowed in November.
" However, the dollar appreciated against the Brazilian real  and the Japanese yen, which were held down by weak economic data and, in the case of the yen, by market reaction to statements suggesting that the country’s likely next government would urge the Bank of Japan to seek a higher rate of inflation."
 The Reserve Bank of Australia and several emerging market central banks also eased monetary policy.
" In addition, in monitoring for possible adverse effects of the current environment of low interest rates, the staff surveyed a wide range of asset markets and financial institutions for signs of excessive valuations, leverage, or risktaking that could pose systemic risks."
"Staff Economic Outlook In the economic projection prepared by the staff for the December FOMC meeting, real gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the near term was revised down slightly relative to th e previous forecast."
 This downward revision primarily reflected weakerthan-expected data for consumer spending and household income that more than offset the somewhat betterthan-anticipated news regarding employment and business equipment investment.
" The staff’s mediumterm forecast for real GDP growth  also was revised down a little, as some of the recent weakness in household spending and income was carried forward in the projection."
" With federal fiscal policy assumed to be tighter next year than this year, the staff expected that the increase in real GDP would not materially exceed the growth rate of potential output in 2013."
" In 2014 and 2015, economic activi ty was projected to accelerate slowly, supported by a lessening in fiscal policy restraint, gains in consumer and business confidence, further improvements in fina ncial conditions and credit availability, and accommodat ive monetary policy."
" The expansion in economic activity was anticipated to result in only a gradual decline in  slack in labor and product markets over the forecast period, and progress in reducing unemployment was expected to be relatively slow."
The staff’s projection for inflation in both the near term and the medium term was essentially unchanged from the forecast prepared for the previous FOMC meeting.
" With crude oil pri ces expected to continue to decrease slowly, the boost to retail food prices from last summer’s drought anticipated to be only temporary and fairly small, longrun inflation expectations assumed to remain stable, an d considerable resource slack persisting over the forecast period, the staff projected that inflation woul d be subdued through 2015."
"Minutes of the Meeting of December 11–12, 2012Page 5_____________________________________________________________________________________________The staff viewed the uncertainty around the projection for economic activity as somewhat elevated and the risks as skewed to the downside, largely reflecting the possibility of a more severe tightening in U.S. fiscal policy than expected, along with continued concerns about the economic and financial situation in Europe."
" Although the staff saw the outlook for inflation as uncertain, the risks were viewed as balanced and not unusually high."
"Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, meeting participants—the 7 members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks, all of whom participate in the deliberations of the FOMC—submitted their assessments of real output growth, the unemployment rate, inflation, and the target federal funds rate for each year from 2012 through 2015 and over the longer run, under each participant’s judgment of appropriate monetary policy."
" The longerrun projections represent ea ch participant’s assessment of the rate to which each va riable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy."
"In their discussion of the economic situation, participants regarded the information received during the intermeeting period as indicating that economic activity and employment continued to expand at a moderate pace, apart from weatherrelated disruptions."
 The unemployment rate had declined somewhat since the summer but remained elevated.
" Although household spending had continued to advance, growth in business fixed investment had slowed."
" Consumer price inflation had been running somewhat below the Committee’s longerrun objective of 2 percent, apart from temporary variations that largely reflected fluctuations in energy prices, and longerterm inflation expectations had remained stable."
" Hurricane Sandy was expected to weigh on economic growth in the current quarter, but rebuilding could provide some temporary impetus early in 2013."
" Participants’ forecasts, which gene rally were conditioned on the view that it would be appropriate to maintain a highly accommodative monetary policy for a considerable time, included an outlook for a continued gradual decline in the unemployment rate toward levels judged to be consistent with the Committee’s mandate over the longer run, with inflation running near the Committee’s 2 percent longerrun goal."
"Participants observed that growth in economic activity continued to be restrained by several persistent headwinds, including ongoing deleveraging on the part of households and stilltight credit conditions for some borrowers, and that a major headwind facing the economy at present appeared to be uncertainty about U.S. fiscal policy and the outcome of the ongoing negotiations on federal spending and taxes."
" While participants generally saw it as likely that the Congress and the Administration would avert the full force of the tax increases and spending cuts scheduled to occur in 2013, almost all indicated that heightened uncertainty about fiscal policy probably was affecting economic activity adversely."
" Some participants noted that an early and constructive resolution to fiscal policy negotiations had the potential to release pentup demand and therefore be followed by a boost to spending, investment, and employment; however, a few pointed out that an extended breakdown of negotiations could have significant adverse effects on economic growth."
 Other factors weighing on the economic outlook included the slowdown in global economic growth and continued uncertainty regarding the European fiscal and banking situation.
" Some participants thought this reflected uncertainty about fiscal policy, including the prospect of higher taxes, and several noted that growth of households’ real disposable income remained weak despite recent gains in employment."
" There were reports of weaker manufacturing, particularly in the Northeast in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, and a slackening in economic activity in the Southwest related in part to cutbacks in defense spending."
" Export orders had softened, reflecting the slowdown in global growth."
"In discussing labor market developments, participants generally viewed the recent data as having been somewhat better than expected, with moderate gains in payroll employment and a decline in the unemployment rate."
" However, the unemploy ment rate remained elevated, and part of the decline in unemployment in November was attributable to a drop in labor force participation."
 A few participants noted that some exits from the labor force may have been related to the loss or prospective loss of eligibility for emergency unemployment insurance benefits.
" A couple of participants noted that vacancies remained at a high level in terms of their historical relationship to the rate of unemployment, suggesting that at least some firms were having a hard time finding suitable workers; indeed, business contacts in a couple of regions had reported difficulty in loca ting and retaining workers with requisite skills."
"Incoming information pointe d to stable, low inflation that was running a little be low the Committee’s longerrun goal of 2 percent."
" Most participants saw the risks to the inflation outlook as broadly balanced, and many noted that longerterm inflation expectations were well anch ored."
" One participant, however, expressed concern that considerable uncertainty surrounded the relationship between unemployment and inflation, raising questions about the extent to which resource slack would keep inflation restrained over the medium term."
" A few participants, observing that low interest rates had increased the demand for riskier financial products, pointed to the possibility that holding interest  rates low for a prolonged period could lead to fina ncial imbalances and imprudent risktaking."
 One participant suggested that there were several historical episod es in the United States and other countries that might be used to build a better understanding of the financial strains that could develop from a long period of very low longterm interest rates.
" Regarding the benefits, it was noted that asset purchases provide support to the economic recovery by putting downward pressure on longerterm interest rates and promoting moreaccommodative financial conditions."
" With regard to the possible costs and risks of purchases, a number  of participants expressed the concern that additional purchases could complicate the Committee’s efforts to eventually withdraw monetary policy accommodation, for example, by potentially causing inflation expectations to rise or by impairing the future implementation of monetary policy."
" Depending on the path for the balance sheet and interest rates, the Federal Reserve’s net income and its remittances to the Treasury could be significantly affected during the period of policy normalization."
Meeting participants discussed the possibility of replacing the calendar date in the forward guidance for the federal funds rate with specific quantitative thresholds of 6½ percent for the unemployment rate and 2½ percent for projected inflation between one and two years ahead.
" Accordingly, thresholds could increase the probability that market reactions to economic developments would move longerterm interest rates in a manner consistent with the Committee’s view regarding the likely future pa th of shortterm interest rates."
" A few participants expressed a preference for using a qualitative description of the economic indicators influencing the Committee’s thinking about current and future monetary policy rather than quantitative guidance because they felt that qualitative guidance would be at least as effective as numerical thresholds while avoiding some potent ial disadvantages, including the possibility that the numerical thresholds would be mistakenly interpreted as the Committee’s longerrun objectives."
" Participants also discussed the importance of clarifying that the thresholds would not be followed mechanically and that a variety of indicators of labor market conditions and inflation pressures, as well as financial developments, would be taken into account in setting policy."
"Committee Policy Action Committee members viewed the information received over the intermeeting period as suggesting that economic activity and employment continued to expand at a moderate pace in recent months, abstracting from Page 8Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________weatherrelated disruptions."
" Household spending had continued to advance and the housing sector had shown further signs of improvement, but growth in the business sector had slowed."
" Although the unemployment rate had declined somewhat since the summer, it  was still elevated relative to levels that members viewed as normal in the longer run."
" Members generally agreed that the economic outlook was little changed since the previous meeting and judged that, without sufficient policy accommodation, economic growth might not be strong enough to generate sustained improvement in labor market conditions."
" Inflation had been subdued, apart from some temporary variations that largely reflected fluctuations in energy prices."
" With longerterm inflation expectations stable, inflation over the medium term was anticipated to run at or below the Committee’s longerrun objective of 2 percent."
"In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, all members but one judged that continued provision of monetary accommodation was warranted in order to support further progress toward the Committee’s goals of maximum employ ment and price stability."
" While almost all members thought that the asset purchase program begun in September had been effective and supportive of growth, they also generally saw that the benefits of ongoing purchases were uncertain and that the potential costs co uld rise as the size of the balance sheet increased."
"With regard to its forward guidance about the federal funds rate, the Committee decided to indicate in the statement language that it expects the highly accommodative stance of monetary policy to remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens."
" In addition, all but one member agreed to replace the datebased guidance with economic thresholds indicating that the exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate would remain appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6½ percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee’s longerrun goal, and longerterm inflation expectations continue to be well anchored."
" The new language noted that the Committee would also consider other information when determining how long to maintain the highly accommodative stance of monetary policy, including a dditional measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and re adings on financial developments."
"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct  the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: “The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output."
" The System Open Market Account Manager and the Secretary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the System’s balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the Committee’s objectives of maximum employment and price stability.” The vote encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 12:30 p.m.: “Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in October suggests that economic activity and employment have continued to expand at a moderate pace in recent months, apart from weather-related disruptions."
" Although the unemployment rate has declined somewhat since the summer, it remains elevated."
" Household spending has continued to advance, and the housing sector has shown further signs of improvement, but growth in business fixed investment has slowed."
" Inflation has been running somewhat below the Committee’s longerrun objective, apart from temporary variations that largely reflect fluctuations in energy prices."
 Longerterm inflation expectations have remained stable.
" Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
" The Committee remains concerned that, without sufficient policy accommodation, economic growth might not be strong enough to generate sustained improvement in labor market conditions."
 The Committee also anticipates that inflation over the medium term likely will run at or below its 2 percent objective.
" To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate, the Committee will continue purchasing additional agency mortgagebacked securities at a pace of $40 billion per month."
" Taken together, these actions should maintain downward pressure on longerterm interest rates, support mortg a g e  m a r k e t s ,  a n d  h e l p  t o  m a k e  b r o a d e r  f i -nancial conditions more accommodative."
" Page 10Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee expects that a highly accommodative stance of mone tary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens."
" In particular, the Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to         ¼ percent and currently anticipates that this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6½ percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee’s      2 percent longerrun goal, and longerterm inflation expectations continue to be well anchored."
" In determining how long to maintain a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy, the Committee will also consider other information, including additional measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings  on financial developments."
" When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced appr oach consistent with its longerrun goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent.” Voting for this action:   Ben Bernanke, William C."
" He continued to view asset purchases as unlikely to add to economic growth without unacceptably increasing the risk of future inflation, and to see purchases of MBS as inappropriate credit allocation."
" With regard to the funds rate, Mr. Lacker was concerned that linking the forward guidance to a specific numerical level of the unemployment rate would inhibit the effectiveness of the Committee’s communications and increase the potential for inflationary policy errors; he preferred qualitative guidance instead."
"English Secretary Minutes of the Meeting of December 11–12, 2012Page 11_____________________________________________________________________________________________ Summary of Economic ProjectionsIn conjunction with the December 11–12, 2012, Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, meeting participants—the 7 members of the Board of Governors and the 12 presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks, all of whom participate in the deliberations of the FOMC—submitted their assessments of real output growth, the unemployment rate, inflation, and the target federal funds rate for each year from 2012 through 2015 and over the l onger run."
 Each participant’s assessment was based on information available at the time of the meeting plus his or her judgment of appropriate monetary policy and assumptions about the factors likely to affect economic outcomes.
" The longer-run projections represent each participant’s judgment of the value to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy."
 “Appropriate monetary policy” is defined as the future path of policy that each participant deems most likely to foster outcomes for economic activity and inflation that best satisfy his or her individual interpretation of the Federal Reserve’s objectives of maximum employment and stable prices.
"Overall, the assessments submitted in December indicated that FOMC participan ts projected that, under appropriate monetary policy, the pace of economic recovery would gradually pick up over the 2012–15 period and inflation would remain subdued (table 1 and figure 1)."
" Participants anticipated that the growth rate of real gross domestic product (GDP) would increase somewhat in 2013 and again in 2014, and that economic growth in 2014 and 2015 would exceed their estimates of the longerrun sustainable rate of growth, while the unemployment rate would decline gradually through 2015."
" Participants projected that each year’s inflation, as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), would run close to or below the FOMC’s longerrun inflation objective of 2 percent."
"As shown in figure 2, most participants judged that highly accommodative monetary policy was likely to be warranted over the next few years."
 Most participants judged that appropriate monetary policy would include purchasing agency mortgagebacked securities (MBS) and longerterm Treasury securities after the completion of the maturity extens ion program at the end of 2012.
"As in September, participants judged the uncertainty associated with the outlook for real activity and the unemployment rate to be unusually high compared with historical norms, with the risks weighted mainly Table 1."

" While a number of participants viewed the uncertainty surrounding their projections for inflation to be unusually high, more saw the level of uncertainty to be broadly similar to historical norms; most considered the risks to inflation to be roughly balanced."
"The Outlook for Economic Activity Participants judged that the economy grew at a moderate pace over the second half of 2012 and projected that, conditional on their individual assumptions about appropriate monetary policy, the economy would grow at a somewhat faster pace in 2013 before expanding in 2014 and 2015 at a rate above what participants saw as the longerrun rate of output growth."
 A number of participants mentioned that last summer’s drought and the effects of Hurricane Sandy likely had held down economic activity in the second half of this year.
" The central tendency of participants’ projections for real GDP growth in 2013 was 2.3 to 3.0 percent, followed by a central tendency of 3.0 to 3.5 percent for 2014 and one of 3.0 to         3.7 percent for 2015."
" Most participants noted that the high degree of monetary policy accommodation assumed in their projections would help promote the economic recovery over the forecast period; however, they also judged that several factors would likely hold back the pace of economic expansion, including slower growth abroad, a stillweak housing market, the difficult fiscal and financial situation in Europe, and fiscal restraint in the United States."
"Participants projected the unemployment rate for the final quarter of 2012 to be cl ose to its average level in October and November, implying a rate somewhat below that projected in September."
" Participants anticipated a gradual decline in the unemployment rate over the forecast period; even so, they generally thought that the unemployment rate at the end of 2015 would still be well above their individual estimates of its longerrun normal level."
" The central tendencies of participants’ forecasts for the unemployment rate were 7.4 to 7.7 percent at the end of 2013, 6.8 to 7.3 percent at the end of 2014, and 6.0 to 6.6 percent at the end of 2015."
" The central tendency of participants’ estimates of the longerrun normal rate of unemployment that would prevail under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy was 5.2 to 6.0 percent, unchanged from September."
" Most participants projected that the unemployment rate would converge to their estimates of its longerrun normal rate in five or six years, while a few judged that less time would be needed."
Figures 3.A and 3.B provide details on the diversity of participants’ views regarding the likely outcomes for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate over the next three years and over the longer run.
" The dispersion in these projections reflects differences in participants’ assessments of many factors, including appropriate monetary policy and its effects on the economy, the rate of improvement in the housing sector, the spillover effects of the fiscal and financial situation in Europe, the prospective path for U.S. fiscal policy, the extent of structural dislocations in the labor market, the likely evolution of credit and financial market conditions, and longerterm trends in productivity and the labor force."
" With the data for much of 2012 now in hand, the dispersion of participants’ projections of real GDP growth and the unemployment rate this year narrowed compared with their September submissions."
" However, the range of projections for real GDP growth in 2015 was little changed from September."
" The distributions of the unemployment rate projections at the end of 2012, 2013, and 2014 all shifted lower, while the range of projections for the unemployment rate for 2015, at 5.7 to 6.8 percent, remained close to its September level."
" The dispersion of estimates for the longerrun rate of output growth stayed fairly narrow, with all but one between 2.2 and 2.5 percent."
" The ra nge of participants’ estimates of the longerrun rate of unemployment, at      5.0 to 6.0 percent, narrowed  relative to September."
The Outlook for Inflation Participants’ views on the broad outlook for inflation under appropriate monetary policy were little changed from September.
" Most anticipated that inflation for 2012 as a whole would be close to 1.6 percent, somewhat lower than projected in September."

" Almost all of the participants judged that both headline and core inflation would remain subdued over the 2013–15 period, running at rates equal to or below the FOMC’s longerrun objective of 2 percent."
" Specifically, the central tendency of participants’ projections for inflation, as measured by the PCE price index, moved down to    1.3 to 2.0 percent for 2013 and was little changed for 2014 and 2015 at 1.5 to 2.0 pe rcent and 1.7 to 2.0 percent, respectively."
 The central tendencies of the forecasts for core inflation were broadly similar to those for the headline measure for 2013 through 2015.
" In discussing factors likely to su stain low inflation, several participants cited stable inflation expectations and expectations for continued sizable resource slack."
Figures 3.C and 3.D provide information about the diversity of participants’ views about the outlook for inflation.
" The range of participants’ projections for headline inflation for 2012 narro wed from 1.5 to       1.9 percent in September to 1.6 to 1.8 percent in December; nearly all participants’ projections in December were at 1.6 percent or 1.7 percent, broadly in line with recent inflation readings."
" The distributions of participants’ projections for he adline inflation in 2013 and 2014 shifted lower compared with the corresponding distributions for September, while the range of projections for core inflation narrowed slightly for both years."
" The distributions for core and overall inflation in 2015 were concentrated near the Committee’s longerrun inflation objective of 2 percen t, although somewhat less so than in September."
"Appropriate Monetary Policy As indicated in figure 2, mo st participants judged that exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate would remain appropriate for several more years."
"Among the participants who saw a later tightening of policy, a majority indicated that they believed it was appropriate to maintain the current level of the federal funds rate until the unemployment rate is less than or equal to 6½ percent."
" In contrast, a majority of those who favored an earlier tightening of policy pointed to concerns about inflation as a primary reason for expecting that it would be appropriate to tighten policy sooner."
" Estimates of the longerrun target federal funds rate ranged from 3 to 4½ percent, reflecting the Committee’s inflation objective of 2 percent and participants’ judgments about the longerrun equilibrium level of the real federal funds rate."
"Key factors informing participants’ views of the economic outlook and the appropriate setting for monetary policy include their judgments regarding labor market conditions that would be consistent with maximum employment, the extent to which employment currently deviated from maximum employment, the extent to which projected inflation over the medium term deviated from the Committee’s longerterm objective of 2 percent, and participants’ projections of the Summary of Economic Projections of the Meeting of December 11–12, 2012Page 7_____________________________________________________________________________________________Figure 3.C.

 Many participants mentioned economic thresholds based on the unemployment rate and the inflation outlook that were consistent with their judgments of when it would be appropriate to consider beginning to raise the federal funds rate.
 There was some concern expressed that a protracted period of very accommodative monetary policy could le ad to imbalances in the financial system.
" It was also noted that because the appropriate stance of monetary policy is conditional on the evolution of real activity and inflation over time, assessments of the appropriate future path of the federal funds rate and the balance sheet could change if economic conditions were to evolve in an unexpected manner."
" Generally, the participants who judged that a longer period of very accommodative monetary policy would be appropriate were those who projected that a sizable gap between the unemployment rate and the longerrun normal level of the unemployment rate would persist until 2015 or l ater."
" In contrast, the majority of the 5 participants who judged that policy firming should begin in 2013 or 2014 indicated that the Committee would need to act relatively soon in order to keep inflation near the FOMC’s longerrun objective of 2 percent and to prevent a rise in inflation expectations."
"Uncertainty and Risks Nearly all of the participants judged their current levels of uncertainty about real GDP growth and unemployment to be higher than  was the  n orm during the previous 20 years (figure 4).1  Seven participants judged that the levels of uncertainty associated with their forecasts of total PCE inflation were higher as well, while another 10 participants viewed uncertainty about inflation as broadly similar to historical norms."
" The main factors cited as contributing to the elevated uncertainty about economic outcomes were the difficulties involved in predicting fiscal policy in the United States, the continuing potential for European developments to threaten financial stability, and the possibility of a general slowdown in global economic growth."
" A number of participants also commented that in the aftermath of the financial crisis, they were more uncertain about the level of potential output and its rate of growth."
" It was noted that some of the uncertainty about potential output arose from the risk that a continuation of elevated levels of longterm unemployment might impair the skills of the affected individu als or cause some of them to drop out of the labor force, thereby reducing potential output in the medium term."
"                                                 1 Table 2 provides estimates of the forecast uncertainty for the change in real GDP, the unemployment rate, and total consumer price inflation over  the period from 1992 through 2011."

" As described in the box “Forecast Uncertainty,” under certain assumptions, there is about a 70 pe rcent probability that actual outcomes for real GDP, unemployment, an d consumer prices  will be in ranges implied by the average size of projection errors made in the past."

" The most frequently identified sources of risk were U.S. fiscal policy, which many participants thought had the potential to slow economic activity significantly over the near term, and the situation in Europe."
" Most participants continued to judge the risks to their projections for inflation as broadly balanced, with several highlighting the recent stability of longerterm inflation expectations."
" However, three participants saw the risks to inflation as tilted to the downside, reflecting, for example, risks of disinflation that could arise from adverse shocks to the economy that policy would have limited scope to offset."
" A couple of participants saw the risks to inflation as weighted to the upside in light of concerns about U.S. fiscal imbalances, the current highly accommodative stance of monetary policy, and uncertainty about the Committee’s ability to shift to a less accommodative polic y stance when it becomes appropriate to do so."
" Summary of Economic Projections of the Meeting of December 11–12, 2012Page 13_____________________________________________________________________________________________        Forecast Uncertainty    The economic projections provided by the members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks inform discussions of monetary policy among policymakers and can aid public understanding of the basis for policy actions."
" Thus, in setting the stance of monetary policy, participants consider no t only what appears to be the most likely economic outcome as embodied in their projections, but also the range of alternative possibilities, the likelihood of their occurring, and the potential costs to the economy should they occur."
"Table 2 summarizes the average historical accuracy of a range of forecasts, including those reported in past Monetary Policy Report s and those prepared by the Federal Reserve Board’s staff in advance of meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee."
" The corresponding 70 percent confidence intervals for overall inflation would be 1.5 to  2.5 percent in the current year, 1.1 to 2.9 percent in the second year, 0.9 to 3.1 percent in the third year, and 1.0 to 3.0 percent in the fourth year."
"As with real activity and inflation, the outlook for the future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable uncertainty."
 This uncertainty arises primarily because each participant’s assessment of the appropriate stance of monetary policy depends importantly on the evolution of real activity and inflation over time.
