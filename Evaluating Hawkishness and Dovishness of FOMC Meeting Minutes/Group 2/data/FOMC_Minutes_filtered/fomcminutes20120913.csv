Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information reviewed at the September 12 –13 meeting suggested that economic activity continued to increase at a moderate pace in recent months.
" Employment rose slowly, and the unemployment rate was still high."
" Consumer price inflation stayed subdued, while measures of longrun inflation expectations remained stable."
"Private nonfarm employment increased in July and August at only a slightly fast er pace than in the second quarter, and the rate of decline in government employment eased somewhat."
" The unemployment rate was 8.1 percent in August, just a bit lower than its average during the first half of the year, and the labor force participation rate edged down further."
" The share of workers employed part time for economic reasons remained large, and the rate of longduration unemployment continued to be high."
" Indicators of job openings and firms’ hiring plans were little changed, on balance, and initial claims for unemployment insurance were essentially flat over the intermeeting period."
The U.S. international trade deficit was about unchanged in July after narrowing significantly in June.
 The trade data fo r July pointed toward real net exports having a roughly neutral effect on the growth of U.S. real gross domestic product (GDP) in the third quarter after they made a positive contribution to the increase in real GDP in the second quarter.
" Nearterm inflation expectations from the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers increased somewhat in August, while longer-term inflation expectations in the survey edged up but remained within the narrow range that they have occupied for many years."
 Longrun inflation expectations from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia Survey of Professional Forecasters continued to be stable in the third quarter.
 The employment cost index increased a little more slowly than the measure of compensation per hour over the same period.
Overall foreign economic growth appeared to be subdued in the third quarter after slowing in the second quarter.
" In Minutes of the Meeting of September 12–13, 2012Page 3_____________________________________________________________________________________________China, export growth slowed, while retail sales and investment spending changed little."
" The rate of economic growth rose in Brazil but was still sluggish, and increases in economic activity in Mexico were below the faster pace seen earlier in the year."
" Consistent with the slowing in foreign economic growth, readings on foreign inflation continued to moderate."
" Investors’ concerns about the situation in Europe seemed to ease somewhat, and market participants also appeared to have increased their expectations of additional monetary policy accommodation."
" Later in the period, Treasury yields retraced some of their earlier gains as market participants’ expectations of additional policy action increased following the release of the minutes of the August FOMC meeting, the Chairman’s speech at the economic symposium in  Jackson Hole, and the weakerthan-expected August employment report."
 Indicators of inflation expectations derived from nominal and inflationprotected Treasury securities edged up over the period but stayed in the ranges observed over recent quarters.
" However, respondents noted greater demand for funding of agency and nonagency residential MBS."
" Broad price indexes for U.S. equities rose moderately, on net, over the intermeeting period, prompted by generally betterthan-expected readings on economic activity released early in the period, somewhat reduced concerns about the situation in Europe, and some additional anticipation of monetary policy easing later in the period."
" Nonrevolving consumer credit continued to expand briskly in June, largely due to robust growth in student loans originated by the federal government, while revolving credit remained subdued."
"Bank credit continued to expand at a moderate pace over the intermeeting period, as growth in C&I loans remained brisk while CRE and home equity loans both trended down further."
"M2 growth was rapid in July, likely reflecting investors’ heightened demand for safe and liquid assets amid concerns about the situation in Europe, but it slowed to a moderate pace in August as those concerns eased somewhat."
 The staff’s broad nominal index of the foreign exchange value of the dollar declined and benc hmark sovereign yields in the major advanced foreign economies increased as safehaven demands eased wi th the lessening of concerns about the European situation.
"The staff also reported on potential risks to financial stability, including those owing to the developments in Europe and to the current environment of low interest rates."
" Although the support for economic activity provided by low interest rates enhances financial stability, low interest rates also could eventually contribute to excessive borrowing or risktaking and possibly leave some aspects of the financial system vulnerable to a future rise in interest rates."
"Staff Economic Outlook  In the economic projection prepared by the staff for the September FOMC meeting, the forecast for real GDP growth in the near term was broadly similar, on balance, to the previous projection."
" The staff’s mediumterm projection for real GDP growth, which was conditioned on the assumption of no changes in monetary policy, was revised up a little, mostly reflecting a slight improvement in the outlook for the European situation and a somewhat higher projected path for equity prices."
" Nevertheless, with fiscal policy assumed to be tighter next year than this year, the staff expected that increases in real GDP would not materially exceed the growth of potential output in 2013."
" In 2014, economic activity was projected to accelerate gradually, supported by an easing in fiscal policy restra int, increases in consumer and business confidence, further improvements in financial conditions and credit availability, and accommodative monetary policy."
" The expansion in economic activity was expected to narrow the significant margin of slack in labor and product markets only slowly over the projection period, and the unemployment rate was anticipated to still be elevated at the end of 2014."
"The staff’s nearterm forecast  for inflation was revised up from the projection prepared for the August FOMC meeting, reflecting increases in consumer energy prices that were greater than anticipated."
" However, the staff’s projection for inflation over the medium term was little changed."
" With crude oil prices expected to gradually decline from their current levels, the boost to retail food prices from the drought anticipated to be only temporary and comparatively small, longrun inflation expectations assumed to remain stable, and substantial resource slack persisting over the projection period, the staff continued to forecast that inflation would be subdued through 2014."
"The staff viewed the uncertai nty around the forecast for economic activity as elevated and the risks skewed to the downside, largely reflecting concerns about the situation in Europe and the possibility of a more severe Minutes of the Meeting of September 12–13, 2012Page 5_____________________________________________________________________________________________tightening in U.S. fiscal policy than anticipated."
" Although the staff saw the outlook for inflation as uncertain, the risks were viewed as balanced and not unusually high."
" Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, meeting participants—the 7 members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks, all of whom participate in the deliberations of the FOMC—submitted their assessments of real output growth, the unemployment rate, inflation, and the target federal funds rate for each year from 2012 through 2015 and over the longer run,  under each participants’ judgment of appropriate monetary policy."
" The longerrun projections represent ea ch participant’s assessment of the rate to which each va riable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy."
"In their discussion of the economic situation and outlook, meeting participants regarded the information received during the intermeeting period as indicating that economic activity had continued to expand at a moderate pace in recent months."
" However, recent gains in employment were  small and the unemployment rate remained high."
" Although consumer spending had continued to advance, growth in business fixed investment appeared to have slowed."
" Consumer price inflation had been subdued despite recent increases in the prices of some key commodities, and longerterm inflation expectations had remained stable."
" In the near term, the drought in the Midwest was expected to weigh on economic growth."
" However, others questioned the role of uncertainty about policy as a factor constraining aggregate demand."
" In addition, participants still saw significant downside  risks to the outlook for economic growth."
" Prominent among these risks were a possible intensification of strains in the euro zone, with potential spillovers to U.S. financial markets and institutions and thus to the broader U.S. economy; a largerthan-expected U.S. fiscal tightening; and the possibility of a further slowdown in global economic growth."
" A few participants, however, mentioned the possibility that economic growth could be more rapid than currently anticipated, particularly if major sources of uncertainty were resolved favorably or if fasterthan-expected advances in the housing sector led to improvements in household balance sheets, increased confidence, and easier credit conditions."
" Participants’ forecasts for economic activity, which in most cases were conditioned on an assumption of additional, nearterm monetary policy accommodation, were also associated with an outlook for the unemployment rate to remain close to recent leve ls through 2012 and then to decline gradually toward levels judged to be consistent with the Committee’s mandate."
" In one District, business surveys pointed to further growth; however, readings on forwardlooking indicators of orders around the country were less positive."
" In addition, business contacts noted that export demand was showing signs of weakness as a result of the slowdown in economic activity in Europe."
 The drought was expected to reduce farm inventories and have a transitory impact on broader measures of economic growth.
Participants generally expected that fiscal policy would continue to be a drag on economic activity over coming quarters.
" Growth in employment had been disappointing, with the average monthly increases in payrolls so far this year below last year’s pace and below the pace that would be required to make significant progress in reducing the unemployment rate."
 The unemployment rate declined around the turn of the year but had not fallen significantly since then.
" In addition, the labor force participation rate and employmentto-population ratios were at or near postrecession lows."
" A few participants reiterated their view that the persistently high level of unemployment reflected the effect of structural factors, including mismatches across and within s ectors between the skills of the unemployed and those demanded in sectors in which jobs were currently available."
 Both of these views would suggest a lower level of potential output and thus reduced scope for combating unemployment with additional monetary policy stimulus.
" Several participants, while acknowledging some evidence of structural changes in the labor market, stated again that weak aggregate demand was the principal reason for the high unemployment rate."
" Several participants noted the risk that continued high levels of unemployment, even if initially cyclical, might ulti mately induce adverse structural changes."
" In particular, they expressed concerns about the risk that the exceptionally high level of longterm unemployment and the depressed level of labor participation could ultimately lead to permanent negative effects on the skills an d prospects of those without jobs, thereby reducing the longerrun normal level of employment and potential output."
" Longerterm interest rates were low and supportive of economic growth, while equity prices had risen."
" One participant noted that, while there were few current signs of excessive risktakin g, low interest rates could ultimately lead to financial imbalances that would be challenging to detect before they became serious problems."
The incoming information on inflation over the intermeeting period was largely in line with participants’ expectations.
" Despite recent increases in the prices of some key commodities, consumer price inflation remained subdued."
" With longerterm inflation expectations stable and the unemployment rate elevated, participants generally anticipated that inflation over the medium run would likely run at or below the 2 percent rate that the Committee judges to be most consistent with its mandate."
 Most partic ipants saw the risks to the outlook for inflation as roughly balanced.
" A few participants felt that maintaining a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy over an extended period could unmoor longerterm inflation expectations and, against a backdrop of higher energy and commodity prices, posed upside risks to inflation."
 Many participants anticipated that such a program would provide support to the economic recovery by putting downward pressure on longerterm interest rates and promoting more accommodative financial conditions.
" One participant, however, objected that purchases of MBS, when compared to purchases of longerterm Treasury securities, would likely result in higher interest rates for many borrowers in other sectors."
" In di scussing the costs and risks that such a program might entail, several participants reiterated their concern that additional purchases might complicate the Committee’s efforts to withdraw monetary policy accommodation when it eventually became appropriate to do so, raisin g the risk of undesirably high inflation in the future and potentially unmooring inflation expectations."
" It was noted that clear communication and credibility allow the central bank to help shape the public’s expectations about policy, which is crucial to managing monetary policy when the federal funds rate is at its effective lower bound."
 Many participants thought that moreeffective forward guidance could be provided by specifying numerical thresholds for labor market and inflation indicators that would be consistent with maintaining the federal funds rate at exceptionally low levels.
Page 8Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________Committee Policy Action Committee members saw the information received over the intermeeting period as suggesting that economic activity had continued to expand at a moderate pace in recent months.
" However, growth in employment had been slow, and al most all members saw the unemployment rate as still elevated relative to levels that they viewed as consistent with the Committee’s mandate."
"  Members generally judged that without additional policy accommodation, economic growth might not be strong enough to generate sustained improvement in labor market condit ions."
 The possibility of a largerthan-expected fiscal tightening in the United States and slower global growth were also  seen as downside risks.
" Inflation had been subdued, even though the prices of some key commodities had increased recently."
" Members generally continued to anticipate that, with longerterm inflation expectations stable and given the existing slack in resource utilization, inflation over the medium term would run at or below the Committee’s longerrun objective of 2 percent."
"In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members generally expressed concerns about the slow pace of improvement in labor market conditions and all members but one agreed that the outlook for economic activity and inflation called for additional monetary accommodation."
" Along with the ongoing purchases of $45 billion per month of  longerterm Treasury securities under the maturity extension program announced in June, these purchases will increase the Committee’s holdings of longerterm securities by about $85 billion each month through the end of the year, and should put downward pressure on longerterm interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help make broader financial conditions more accommodative."
"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct  the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was in structed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: “The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output."
 The System Open Market Account Manager and the Secretary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the System’s balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the Committee’s objectives of maximum employment and price stability.” The vote encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 12:30 p.m.: “Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in August suggests that economic activity has continued to expand at a moderate pace in recent months.
" Growth in employment has been slow, and the unemployment rate remains elevated."
" Household spending has continued to advance, but growth in business fixed investment appears to have slowed."
" Inflation has been subdued, although the prices of some key commodities have increased recently."
 Longerterm inflation expectations have remained stable.
"Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
" The Committee is concerned that, without further policy accommodation, economic growth might not be strong enough to generate sustained improvement in labor market conditions."
 The Committee also anticipates that inflation over the medium term likely would run at or below its    2 percent objective.
"To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate, the Committee agreed today to increase policy accommodation by purchasing additional agency mortgagebacked securities at a pace of $40 billion per month."
" These actions, which together will increase the Committee’s holdings of longerterm securities by about $85 billion each month through the end of the year, should put downward pressure on longerterm interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative."
"To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee expects that a highly accommodative stance of mone tary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the economic recovery strengthens."
Mr. Lacker dissented because he believed that additional monetary stimulus at this time was unlikely to result in a discernible improvement in economic growth without also causing an unwant ed increase in inflation.
" At this meeting, participants discussed possible formulations of the monetary policy assumptions on which to condition an FOMC consensus forecast and alternative approaches for participants to express their endorsement of the consensus forecast."
"English Secretary  Minutes of the Meeting of September 12–13, 2012Page 11_____________________________________________________________________________________________Summary of Economic Projections In conjunction with the September 12− 13, 2012, Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, meeting participants—the 7 members of the Board of Governors and the 12 presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks, all of whom participate in the deliberations of the FOMC—submitted their assessments, under each participant’s judgment of appropriate monetary policy, of real output growth, the unemployment rate, inflation, and the target federal funds rate for each year from 2012 through 2015 and ov er the longer run."
" The longerrun projections represent each participant’s judgment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy."
 “Appropriate monetary policy” is defined as the future path of policy that participants deem most likely to foster outcomes for economic activity and inflation that best satisfy their individual interpretations of the Federal Reserve’s objectives of maximum employment and stable prices.
"Overall, the assessments that FOMC participants submitted in September indicated that, under appropriate monetary policy, the pace of economic recovery over the 2012−15 period would gradually pick up and inflation would remain subdued (table 1 and figure 1)."
" Participants judged that the growth rate of real gross domestic product (GDP) would increase somewhat in 2013 and that economic growth in 2014 and 2015 would modestly exceed part icipants’ estimates of the longerrun sustainable rate of growth, while the unemployment rate would declin e gradually through 2015."
" Participants projected that inflation, as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), would run close to or below the FOMC’s longerrun inflation objective of 2 percent."
"As shown in figure 2, most participants judged that highly accommodative monetary policy was likely to be warranted over the next few years."
" The majority of participants judged that appropriate monetary policy would involve a decision by the Committee, at the September meeting or before long, to undertake significant additional asset purchases."
"As in June, participants in  September judged the uncertainty associated with the outlook for real activity and the unemployment rate to be unusually high compared with historical norms, with the risks weighted mainly toward slower economic growth and a higher unemployment rate."
 While a number of participants viewed the uncertainty surrounding their projections for inflation to be unusually high in comparison with historical Table 1.

"The Outlook for Economic Activity Conditional on their individual assumptions about appropriate monetary policy, participants judged that the economy would grow at a moderate pace over coming quarters and then pick up  somewhat in 2013 before expanding in 2014 and 2015 at a rate modestly above what participants saw as the longerrun rate of output growth."
 Many participants characterized the incoming data as having been to the weak side of their expectations at the time of the June meeting; several participants also cited the severe drought as a factor causing them to mark down their projections for economic growth in 2012.
" However, participants’ projections for 2013 and 2014 were generally slightly higher than in June; this reflected, in part, a greater assumed amount of monetary policy accommodation than in their June submissions as well as some improvement since then in the outlook for economic activity in Europe."
" The central tendency of participants’ projections for real  GDP growth in 2013 was 2.5 to 3.0 percent, followed by central tendencies for both 2014 and 2015 of 3.0 to 3.8 pe rcent."
" While most participants note d that the increased degree of monetary policy accommodation assumed in their projections would help promote a faster recovery, participants cited several headwinds that would be likely to hold back the pace of economic expansion over the forecast period, including sl ower growth abroad, a stillweak housing market, the difficult fiscal and financial situation in Europe, and fiscal restraint in the United States."
"Participants projected the unemployment rate at the end of 2012 to remain close to  recent levels, with a central tendency of 8.0 to 8.2 percent, the same as in their June submissions."
" Participants anticipated gradual improvement from 2013 through 2015; even so, they generally thought that the unemployment rate at the end of 2015 would still lie well above their individual estimates of its longerrun normal level."
" The central tendencies of participants’ forecasts for the unemployment rate were 7.6 to 7.9 percent at the end of 2013, 6.7 to       7.3 percent at the end of 2014, and 6.0 to 6.8 percent at the end of 2015."
" The central tendency of participants’ estimates of the longerrun normal rate of unemployment that would prevail under the assumption of appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy was 5.2 to 6.0 percent, unchanged from June."
" Most participants projected that the gap between the current unemployment rate and their estimates of its longerrun normal rate would be closed in five or six years, while a few judged that less time would be needed."
Figures 3.A and 3.B provide details on the diversity of participants’ views regarding the likely outcomes for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate over the next three years and over the longer run.
" The dispersion in these projections reflects differences in participants’ assessments of many factors, including appropriate monetary policy and its effects on the economy, the rate of improvement in the housing sector, the spillover effects of the fiscal and financial situation in Europe, the prospective path for U.S. fiscal policy, the extent of structural dislocations in the labor market, the likely evolution of credit and financial market conditions, and longerterm trends in productivity and the labor force."
" With much of the data for the first eight months of 2012 now in hand, the dispersion of participants’ projections of real GDP growth and the unemployment rate this year narrowed in September compared with June."
" The distribution of projections for the unemployment rate was not much altered for 2013, while for 2014 it narrowed a bit and shifted down slightly."
 The range for the unemployment rate for 2015 was 5.7 to 6.9 percent.
" As in June, the dispersion of estimates for the longerrun rate of output growth was fairly narrow, with the values being mostly from 2.2 to 2.7 percent."
" The range of participants’ estimates of the longerrun rate of unemployment was 5.0 to 6.3 percent, a similar range to that in June; this range reflected different judgments among participants about several factors, including the outlook for labor force participation and the structure of the labor market."
The Outlook for Inflation Participants’ views on the broad outlook for inflation under the assumption of appropriate monetary policy were little changed from Ju ne.
" For 2012 as a whole, most anticipated that overall inflation would be only slightly above its average annual rate of 1.6 percent over the first half of the year; a number of participants pointed to higher food prices in response to the drought, along with recent increases in oil prices, as temporary sources of upward  pressure on the headline Page 4Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________Figure 3.A.

" Almost all participants judged that both headline and core inflation would remain subdued over the 2013–15 period, running at rates at or below the FOMC’s longerrun objective of 2 percent."
" In pointing to factors likely to restrain price pressures, several participants cited sizable resource slack and stable inflation expectations, while a few noted the subdued behavior of labor compensation."
" Specifically, the central tendency of participants’ projections for inflation, as measured by the PCE price index, moved up and tightened to 1.7 to 1.8 perc ent for 2012 and was little changed for 2013 and 2014 at 1."
 The central tendencies of the forecasts for core inflation were broadly similar to those for the headline measure for 2013 through 2015.
Figures 3.C and 3.D provide information about the diversity of participants’ views about the outlook for inflation.
" Participants’ pr ojections for headline inflation for 2012, which in June had ranged from 1.2 to     2 percent, narrowed in September to the range of 1.5 to 1.9 percent; about threefourths of participants’ projections took values of 1.7 to 1.8 percent, broadly in line with recent inflation readings."
" The distributions of participants’ projections fo r headline inflation in 2013 and 2014 were very similar to  those for June, while the range of projections for core inflation narrowed slightly for both years."
 The distributions for core and overall inflation in 2015 were concentrated near the Committee’s longerrun inflation objective of 2 percent.
"Appropriate Monetary Policy As indicated in figure 2, mo st participants judged that exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate would remain appropriate for several more years."
" In total, 14 participants judged that appropriate monetary policy called for a more -accommodative path for the federal funds rate than in their June submissions, involving either a lower target for the federal funds rate at the end of the initial year of policy firming, or a shift out in the first year of firming."
"The key factors informing participants’ individual assessments of the appropriate setting for monetary policy included their judgments regarding labor market conditions that would be consistent with the maximum level of employment, the extent to which employment currently deviated from th e maximum level of employment, the extent to which inflation deviated from the Committee’s longerterm objective of 2 percent, and participants’ projections of the likely time horizon necessary to return employment and inflation to mandateconsistent levels."
 Several participants noted that their assessments of appropriate monetary policy reflected the subpar pace of labor market improvement and the persistent shortfall of output from potential since the 2007–09 recession.
" A few participants noted that their settings of appropriate federal funds rate policy took into account unusua l factors prevailing in recent years, such as the likelihood that the neutral level of the federal funds rate was somewhat below its hisSummary of Economic Projections of the Meeting of September 12–13, 2012Page 7_____________________________________________________________________________________________Figure 3.C.

 Two participants expressed concern that a protracted period of very accommodative monetary policy could lead to imbalances in the financial system.
" Participants also noted that because the appropriate stance of monetary policy is conditional on the evolution of real activity and inflation over time, their assessments of the appropriate future path of the federal funds rate and the balance sheet could change if economic conditions were to evolve in an unexpected manner."
 Those who judged that a longer period of very accommodative monetary policy would be appropriate generally were participants who projected a sizable gap between the unemployment rate and the longerrun normal level of the unemployment  rate until 2015 or later.
" In contrast, the 6 participants who judged that policy firming should begin in 2012, 2013, or 2014 indicated that the Committee would need to act relatively soon in order to keep inflation near the FOMC’s longerrun objective of 2 percent and to prevent a rise in inflation expectations."
"Uncertainty and Risks Nearly all participants judged  that their current level of uncertainty about real GDP growth and unemployment was higher than was the norm during the previous     20 years (figure 4).1  Eight participants judged the level of uncertainty associated with their forecasts of total PCE inflation to be higher as well, while another        10  participants viewed  uncertainty about  inflation  as                                                  1 Table 2 provides estimates of the forecast uncertainty for the change in real GDP, the unemployment rate, and total consumer price inflation over the period from 1991 to 2011."

" As described in the box “Forecast Uncertainty,” under certain assumptions, there is about a 70 pe rcent probability that actual outcomes for real GDP, unemployment, an d consumer prices  will be in ranges implied by the average size of projection errors made in the past."
" The main factors cited as contributing to the elevated uncertainty about economic outcomes were the ongoing fiscal and financial situation in Europe, the outlook for fiscal policy in the United States, and a general slowdown in global economic growth, including the possibility of a significant slowdown in China."
" A number of participants commented that in the aftermath of the financial crisis, they were more uncertain about the level of potential output and its rate of growth."
" A couple of participants noted that some of the uncertainty about potential output arose from the risk that continuation of longterm unemployment might impair the skill level of the labor force or cause some workers to retire earlier than would otherwise have been the case, thereby reducing potential output in the medium term."
"A majority of participants reported that they saw the risks to their forecasts of real GDP growth as weighted toward the downside and, accordingly, the risks to their projections of the unemployment rate as tilted to the upside."
" The most frequently identified sources of risk were the situation in Europe, which many participants thought had the potential to slow global economic activity further, particularly over the near term, and issues associated with fiscal policy in the United States."
"Most participants continued to judge the risks to their projections for inflation as broadly balanced, with several highlighting the recent stability of inflation expectaPage 10Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________Figure 3.E.

" However, four participants saw the risks to inflation as tilted to the downside, with a couple of them noting that slack in resource markets could turn out to be greater than they were anticipating."
" Three participants saw the risks to inflation as weighted to the upside in light of concerns about U.S. fiscal imbalances, the current highly accommodative stance of monetary policy, and uncertainty abou t the Committee’s ability to shift to a less accommodat ive policy stance when it becomes appropriate to do so."
"   Summary of Economic Projections of the Meeting of September 12–13, 2012Page 13_____________________________________________________________________________________________       Forecast Uncertainty    The economic projections provided by the members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks inform discussions of monetary policy among policymakers and can aid public understanding of the basis for policy actions."
" Thus, in setting the stance of monetary policy, participants consider no t only what appears to be the most likely economic outcome as embodied in their projections, but also the range of alternative possibilities, the likelihood of their occurring, and the potential costs to the economy should they occur."
"Table 2 summarizes the average historical accuracy of a range of forecasts, including those reported in past Monetary Policy Report s and those prepared by the Federal Reserve Board’s staff in advance of meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee."
" The corresponding 70 percent confidence intervals for overall inflation would be 1.5 to  2.5 percent in the current year, 1.1 to 2.9 percent in the second year, 0.9 to 3.1 percent in the third year, and 1.0 to 3.0 percent in the fourth year."
"As with real activity and inflation, the outlook for the future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable uncertainty."
 This uncertainty arises primarily because each participant’s assessment of the appropriate stance of monetary policy depends importantly on the evolution of real activity and inflation over time.
