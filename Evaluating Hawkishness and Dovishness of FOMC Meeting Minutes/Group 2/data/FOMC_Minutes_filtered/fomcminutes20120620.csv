" In particular, participants noted that while the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) provides information about their individual projections of key macroeconomic variables and about the path of monetary policy that each sees as appropriate and consistent with his or her projections, the SEP does not provide guidance about how those                                                  3 The policy is available at www .federalreserve.gov/monetary policy/files/FOMC_ExtComm unicationStaff.pdf ."
" Participants generally indicated a willingn ess to explore adjustments to the SEP, while highlighting the importance of communicating not only the Committee’s collective judgment but also the diversity of their views regarding the economic outlook and monetary policy."
" In addition, the Authorization was amended to include the authority to conduct intraday repurchase agreement (repo) transactions with foreign and international accounts to prevent daylight overdrafts in those accounts.4 Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information reviewed at the June 19–20 meeting suggested that economic activity was expanding at a somewhat more modest pace than earlier in the year."
" Improvements in labor market conditions slowed in recent months, and the unemployment rate remained elevated."
" Consumer price inflation declined, primarily reflecting reductions in the prices of crude oil and gasoline, and measures of longrun inflation expectations continued to be stable."
"Private nonfarm employment rose at a slower pace in April and May than in the first quarter of the year, while total government employment continued to trend down."
" The unemployment rate stood at 8.2 percent in May, essentially the same as its average in the first quarter."
" The rate of longduration unemployment remained very high, and the share of workers employed part time for economic reasons was little changed in recent months."
" Indicators of job openings and firms’ hiring plans were mixed, while initial claims for unemployment insurance were essentially unchanged over the intermeeting period at a le vel consistent with modest net job gains in the coming months."
The U.S. international trade deficit widened in March and then narrowed in April to a level near its average in the first quarter.
" In particular, exports to the euro area, which had increased strongly in the first quarter on a seasonally adjusted basis despite the weak ness in economic activity in the region, fell back in April."
" Nearterm inflation expectations from the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers declined in May and held steady in early June, while longerterm inflation expectations in the survey remained stable."
" Gains in compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector were quite muted over the year ending in the first quarter, and with small gains in productivity, unit labor costs rose only slightly."
 The employment cost index increased only a little faster than the compensation per hour measure over the same period.
Recent indicators suggested that overall foreign economic activity was expanding at a belowtrend pace in the second quarter.
" In China, data on production and sales in April and May suggested that economic activity was increasing at a less rapid pace than last year."
" In both advanced and emerging market economies, declining prices for energy and other commodities contributed to decreases in          12month measures of inflation since late last year."
"Yields on longerdated nominal and inflationprotected Treasury securities moved do wn substantially, on net, over the intermeeting period."
 The yield on nominal  10year Treasury securities reached a historically low level immediately following the release of the May employment report.
" A sizable portion of the decline in longerterm Treasury rates over the period appeared to reflect greater safehaven demands by investors, along with some increase in market participants’ expectations of further Federal Reserve balance sheet actions."
" Indicators of inflation expectations derived from nominal and inflationprotected Treasury securities also fell, apparently responding at least in part to the decline in commodity prices."
Heightened financial strains in  the euro area and indications of a weaker pace of global economic activity weighed on foreign financial markets during the intermeeting period.
" Signs of a slowdown in global economic growth prompted policy easing by central banks in Brazil, China, and Australia, and the Bank of England announced new lending initiatives."
"Staff Economic Outlook  In the economic projection prepared by the staff for the June FOMC meeting, the forecast for real gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the near term was revised down."
" Moreover, recent adverse developments in Europe and tighter domestic financial conditions led the staff to revise down somewhat the medium-term forecast for real GDP growth."
" With the drag from fiscal policy anticipated to increase next year, the staff projected that the growth rate of real GDP would not materially exceed that of potential output until 2014 when economic activi ty was expected to accelerate gradually, supported by accommodative monetary policy, further improvemen ts in credit availability, and rising consumer and busi ness sentiment."
" Increases in economic activity were anticipated to narrow the wide margin of slack in labor and product markets only slowly over the projection period, and the unemployment rate was expected to still be elevated at the end of 2014."
"The staff’s nearterm projection for inflation was revised down from the forecast prepared for the April FOMC meeting, reflecting a greaterthan-expected drop in consumer energy prices."
" However, the staff’s projection for inflation over the medium term was essentially unchanged."
" With the upward pressure from the earlier runup in crude oil prices on consumer energy prices unwinding and oil prices expected to decline further, longrun inflation expectations anticipated to remain stable, and substantial resource slack persisting over the forecast period, the staff continued to project that inflation would be subdued through 2014."
"Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, meeting participants—the 7 members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks, all of whom participate in the deliberations of the FOMC—submitted their assessments of real output growth, the unemployment rate, inflation, and the target federal funds rate for each year from 2012 through 2014 and over the longer run, under each participant’s judgment of appropriate monetary policy."
" The longerrun projections represent ea ch participant’s assessment of the rate to which each va riable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy."
" Growth in employment, in particular, appeared to have slowed in recent months, and the unemployment rate remained elevated."
" Inflation had slowed somewhat, mainly reflecting the decline in the prices of crude oil and gasoline in recent months, and longerterm inflation expectations remained stable."
Participants generally interpreted the information that became available during the intermeeting period as suggesting that economic growth would most likely remain moderate over coming quarters and then pick up very gradually.
" Most participants saw the incoming information as indicating somewhat slower growth in total demand, output, and employment over coming quarters than they had projected in April, and most carried forward some of that downward revision to their projections of mediumterm growth."
" Reflecting the projected moderate pace of growth in production and emPage 6Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ployment, most participants anticipated that the unemployment rate would decline only slowly."
" A number of factors continued to be seen as likely to limit the economic expansion to a moderate pace in the near term; these included slow growth or even contraction in some major foreign economies, ongoing and prospective fiscal tightening in the United States, modest growth in household income, and—despite some recent signs of improvement—continued weakness in the housing sector."
" Looking beyond the temporary effects on inflation of this year’s fluctuations in oil and other commodity prices, almost  all participants continued to anticipate that inflation over the mediumterm would run at or below the 2 percent rate that the Committee judges to be most consistent with its statutory mandate."
" In one participant’s judgment, appropriate monetary policy would lead to inflation modestly greater than 2 percent for a time in order to bring unemployment down somewhat faster."
 Some participants indicated that they saw persistent slack in resource utilization as posing downside risks to the outlook for inflation; a few participants judged that the highly accommodative stance of monetary policy posed upside risks to the mediumterm inflation outlook.
"In discussing the household sector, meeting participants noted that real personal consumption expenditures had continued to expand despite weak growth in real disposable income, but that the pace of expansion appeared to have slowed since earlier this year."
 A few participants expressed concern that slow growth in employment and low levels of consumer confidence would further restrain consumer spending.
" Contacts in some parts of the country also indicated that firms had become more cautious in their hiring and investment decisions, with most capital investment being undertaken to improve productivity and reduce costs rather than to expand capacity."
Participants expected that fiscal policy would continue to be a drag on economic growth over coming quarters.
"Minutes of the Meeting of June 19–20, 2012Page 7_____________________________________________________________________________________________Exports helped support U.S. economic growth during the early months of this year."
 A couple of participants expressed the view that the direct effects on the U.S. economy stemming from slower economic growth ab road—effects that would be manifested through declining U.S. exports—would be noticeable but not large.
"The pace of improvement in labor market conditions diminished in recent months; in particular, growth in employment slowed."
" Job growth late last year and early this year was boosted by unusually mild winter weather; some slowing had been expected as weather became more normal during the spring, but the reported slowing was more substantial than many participants had anticipated."
 One participant noted that the apparent tension between strong employment growth and moderate output growth seen earlier in the year had been resolved more recently by slower job growth rather than faster output growth.
" Even so, average monthly growth in payrolls from January through May was in line with last year’s pace."
" Some participants judged that the unemployment rate was being substantially boosted by structural factors such as mismatches between the skills of unemployed workers and those required for available jobs, a view that would imply less slack in labor markets than suggested by a simple comparison of the current unemployment rate to  participants’ estimates of its longerrun normal level."
 A couple of participants said they would have expected inflation to slow noticeably if there were substantia l and persistent slack.
 One implication of the view that there is relatively little slack is that providing more monetary stimulus would be likely to raise inflation ab ove the Committee’s objective.
" Some other participants acknowledged that structural factors were contributing to unemployment, but said that, in their view, slack remained high and weak aggregate demand was the major reason that the unemployment rate was still elevated."
 These participants cited a range of evidence to support their judgment:  the stillhigh fraction of workers who report working parttime jobs because they cannot find fulltime work; research showing that jobfinding rates among the longterm unemployed were somewhat higher in the recent past than a year earlier; anecdotal evidence to the effect that employers do not see long spells of unemployment as making applicants less attractive for most jobs; and reports that employers were receiving large numbers of applications for each opening and were being especially discriminati ng when filling vacant positions.
" Another participant pointed to research showing that, in many countries, in flation is less responsive to downward pressure from labor market slack when inflation is already low than when inflation is elevated, and to evidence that firms in the United States have been reluctant to cut nominal wages in recent years, as indications that sizable slack might not cause inflation to decline from its already low level."
 These arguments imply that slack in labor markets remains considerable and therefore that a reduction in the unemployment rate toward its longerrun normal level would not have much effect on inflation.
"Measures of consumer price inflation declined over the intermeeting period, mainly reflecting reductions in oil and gasoline prices since earlier in the year."
" With longerrun inflation expectations well anchored and the unemployment rate elevated, almost all participants anticipated that inflation in coming quarters and over the medium run would be at or below the 2 percent rate that the Committee judges to be most consistent with its mandate; several had revised down their inflation forecasts."
 Most participants  viewed the risks to their inflation outlook as being ro ughly balanced.
" Some participants, however, saw persis tent slack in resource utilization as weighting the risks to the outlook for inflation to the downside."
" In contrast, a few saw inflation risks as tilted to the upside; they generally were skeptical of models that rely on economic slack to forecast inflation and were concerne d that maintaining the current highly accommodative stance of monetary policy over the medium run risked eroding the stability of inflation expectations, with a couple noting that large longrun fiscal imbalances  also posed a risk."
  Many FOMC participants judged that overall financial conditions had become somewhat less supportive of growth in demand for goods and services.
" In cont rast, a few participants observed that the marked drop in yields on longerterm U.S. Treasury securities could provide some impetus to growth."
 A few participants indicated that they were seeing signs that very low interest rates might be inducing some investors to take on imprudent risks in the search for higher nominal returns.
" However, growth in employment had slowed in recent months, and almost all members saw the unemployment rate as still elevated relative to levels that they viewed as consistent with the Committee’s mandate."
" Members generally expected growth to be moderate over coming quarters and then to pick up very gradually, with the unemployment rate declining only slowly."
" Most projected somewhat slower growth through next year, and a smaller reduction in unemployment, than they had projected in April."
" Furthermore, strains in global financial markets, which larg ely stemmed from the sovereign debt and banking situation in Europe, had increased during the intermeeting period and continued to pose significant downside risks to economic activity both here and abroad, making the outlook quite uncertain."
" Inflation had slowed, mainly reflecting the decline in the prices of crude oil and gasoline in recent months."
" Averaging through its recent fluctuations, inflation appeared to be running near the Committee’s 2 percent longerrun objective; with longerterm inflation expectations stable, members anticipated that inflation over the medium run would be at or below that  rate."
 Some members judged that persistent slack in resource utilization posed downside risks to the outlook for inflation.
" In contrast, one member thought that maintaining the current highly accommodative stance of monetary policy well into 2014 would pose upside risks to inflation."
"In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members agreed that it would be appropriate to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent in order to support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at the 2 percent rate that the Committee judges most consistent with its mandate."
 Members generally judged that continuing the maturity extension program would put some downward pressure on longerterm interest rates and help make broader financial conditions more accommodative.
" One member anticipated little if any effect on economic growth and unemployment  and did not agree that Minutes of the Meeting of June 19–20, 2012Page 9_____________________________________________________________________________________________the outlook for economic activity and inflation called for further poli cy accommodation."
" In light of their assessment of the economic situation, almost all members again agreed to indicate that the Committee expects to maintain a highly accommodative stance for monetary policy and currently anticipates that economic conditions—including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run—are likely to warrant exceptionall y low levels for the federal funds rate at least through late 2014."
" Some Committee members indicated that their policy judgment reflected in part their perception of significant downside risks to growth, especially since the Committee’s ability to respond to weakerthan-expected economic conditions would be somewhat limited by the constraint imposed on monetary policy when the policy rate is at or near its effective lower bound."
A few members expressed the view that further policy stimulus likely would be necessary to promote satisfactory growth in employment and to ensure that the inflation rate would be at the Committee’s goal.
" Several others noted that additional policy action could be warranted if the economic recovery were to lose momentum, if the downside risks to  the forecast became sufficiently pronounced, or if inflation seemed likely to run persistently below the Committee’s longerrun objective."
"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct  the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was in structed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: “The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output."
 The System Open Market Account Manager and the Secretary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the System’s balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the Committee’s objectives of maximum employment and price stability.” The vote encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 12:30 p.m.: “Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in April suggests that the economy has been expanding moderately this year.
" However, growth in Page 10Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________employment has slowed in recent months, and the unemployment rate remains elevated."
" Inflation has declined, mainly reflecting lower prices of crude oil and gasoline, and longerterm inflation expectations have remained stable."
"Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
 The Committee expects economic growth to remain moderate over coming quarters and then to pick up very gradually.
" Consequently, the Committee anticipates that the unemployment rate will decline only slowly toward levels that it judges to be consistent with its dual mandate."
 The Committee anticipates that inflation over the medium term will run at or below the rate that it judges most consistent with its dual mandate.
"To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate, the Committee expects to maintain a highly accommodative stance for monetary policy."
" In particular, the Committee decided today to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and currently anticipates that economic conditions—including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run—are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through late 2014."
 This continuation of the maturity extension program should put downward pressure on longerter m interest rates and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative.
 He did not believe that further monetary stimulus at this time would make a substantial difference for economic growth and employment without also increasing inflation by more than would be desirable.
" In Mr. Lacker’s view, the outlook for economic growth had clearly weakened of late, but he questioned whether the maturity extension program would have much effect in current circumstances."
" Should inflation fall substantially and persistently below the Committee’s 2 percent goal, however, he felt that monetary stimulus might then be appropriate to ensure the return of inflation toward target."
"English  Secretary Minutes of the Meeting of June 19–20, 2012Page 11_____________________________________________________________________________________________Summary of Economic ProjectionsIn conjunction with the June 19–20, 2012, Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, meeting participants—the 7 members of the Board of Governors and the 12 presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks, all of whom participate in the deliberations of the FOMC—submitted their assessments, under each participant’s judgment of appropriate monetary policy, of real output growth, the unemployment rate, inflation, and the target federal funds rate for each year from 2012 through 2014 and ov er the longer run."
" The longerrun projections represent each participant’s judgment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy."
 “Appropriate monetary policy” is defined as the future path of policy that participants deem most likely to foster outcomes for economic activity and inflation that best satisfy their individual interpretations of the Federal Reserve’s objectives of maximum employment and stable prices.
" Overall, the assessments that FOMC participants submitted in June indicated that, under appropriate monetary policy, the pace of economic expansion over the 2012−14 period would likely continue to be moderate and inflation would remain subdued (see table 1 and figure 1)."
 Participants judged that the growth rate of real gross domestic product (GDP) would pick up gradually and that the unemployment rate would edge down very slowly.
" Participants projected that inflation, as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), would run close to or below the FOMC’s longerrun inflation objective of 2 percent."
"As shown in figure 2, most participants judged that highly accommodative monetary policy was likely to be warranted over the forecast period."
 A majority of participants judged that appropriate monetary policy would involve an extension of the maturity extension program (MEP) through the end of 2012.
"Overall, participants judged the uncertainty associated with the outlook for real activity and the unemploym e n t  r a t e  t o  b e  u n u s u a l l y  h i g h  r e l a t i v e  t o  h i s t o r i c a l  norms, with the risks weighted mainly toward slower economic growth and a higher unemployment rate."
" Many participants also viewed the uncertainty surrounding their projections for inflation to be greater than normal, but most saw the risks to inflation to be broadly balanced."
"The Outlook for Economic Activity Conditional upon their individual assumptions about appropriate monetary policy, participants judged that Table 1."

" In addition, most noted that the worsening situation in Europe was leading to a slowdown in global economic growth and greater volatilit y in financial markets."
" Compared with their April submissions, most participants lowered their mediumrun projections of economic activity somewhat."
" The central tendencies of participants’ projections of real economic growth in 2013 and 2014 were 2.2 to 2.8 perc ent and 3.0 to       3.5 percent, respectively."
"Consistent with the downward revisions to their projections for real GDP grow th in 2012 and 2013, nearly all participants marked up their assessments for the rate of unemployment."
" Participants projected the unemployment rate at the end of 2012 to remain at or slightly below recent levels, with a central tendency of 8.0 to 8.2 percent, somewhat higher than their April submissions."
" Participants anticipated gradual improvement in labor market conditions by 2014, but even so, they generally thought that the unemployment rate at the end of that year would still lie well above their individual estimates of its longerrun normal level."
 The central tendencies of participants’ forecasts for the unemployment rate were 7.5 to 8.0 percent at the end of 2013 and 7.0 to 7.7 percent at the end of 2014.
" The central tendency of participants’ estimates of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment that would prevail under the assumption of appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy was 5.2 to 6.0 percent, unch anged from April."
" Most participants projected that the gap between the current unemployment rate and their estimates of its longerrun normal rate would be closed in five or six years, a couple judged that less time would be needed, and one thought more time would be necessary because of the persistent headwinds impeding the economic expansion."
Figures 3.A and 3.B provide details on the diversity of participants’ views regarding the likely outcomes for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate over the next three years and over the longer run.
" The dispersion in these projections reflects differences in participants’ assessments of many factors, including appropriate monetary policy and its effects on the economy, the underlying momentum in economic activity, the spillover effects of the fiscal and financial situation in Europe, the prospective path for U.S. fiscal policy, the extent of structural dislocations in the labor market, and the likely evolution of credit and financial market conditions."
" Compared with their April assessments, the range of participants’ forecasts for the change in real GDP in 2012 and 2013 sh ifted lower, while the dispersion of individual forecasts for growth in 2014 was about unchanged."
" Consistent with the downward shift in the distribution of forecasts for economic growth, the distribution of projections for the unemployment rate shifted up in 2012 and 2013 and, to a lesser extent, in 2014."
" As in  April, the dispersion of estimates for the longerrun rate of output growth was fairly narrow, generally in a range of 2.2 to 2.7 percent."
" In contrast, participants’ views about the level to which the unemployment rate would converge in the longer run were more diverse, reflecting, among other things, different views on the outlook for labor supply and the structure of the labor market."
The Outlook for Inflation Participants’ views about the mediumrun outlook for inflation under the assumption of appropriate monetary policy were little changed from April.
" However, nearly all of them marked down their assessment of headline inflation in the near term, pointing to recent declines in the prices of crude oil and gasoline that were sharper than previously projected."
" Almost all participants judged that both headline and core inflation would remain subdued over the 2012 −14 period, running at rates at or below the FOMC’s longerrun objective of 2 percent."
" Some participants noted that inflation expectations had remained stable, and several pointed to resource slack and moderate increases in labor compensation as sources of restraint on prices."
" Specifically, the central tendency of participants’ projections for inflation, as measured by the PCE price index, moved down in 2012 to 1.2 to  1.7 percent and was little changed in 2013 and 2014 at 1.5 to 2.0 percent."

Figures 3.C and 3.D provide information about the diversity of participants’ views about the outlook for inflation.
" Relative to the assessments compiled in April, the projections for headline inflation shifted down in 2012, reflecting the d eclines in energy prices."
 The distributions of participants’ projections for headline and core inflation in 2013 and 2014 were slightly lower than those reported in April.
"Appropriate Monetary Policy As indicated in figure 2, mo st participants judged that exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate would remain appropriate at least until late 2014."
" Estimates of the longerrun target federal funds rate ranged from 3 to 4½ percent, reflecting the Committee’s inflation objective of 2 percent and participants’ judgments about the longerrun equilibrium level of the real federal funds rate."
" Of the 12 participants whose assessments of appropriate monetary policy included additional balance sheet policies, 11 indicated that their assumptions incorporated an extension through the end of 2012 of the MEP, and 2 participants conditioned their economic forecasts on a new program of securities purchases."
"The key factors informing participants’ individual assessments of the appropriate setting for monetary policy included their judgments regarding the maximum level of employment, the extent to which current conditions had deviated from mandateconsistent levels, and participants’ projections of the likely time horizon necessary to return employment and inflation to such levels."
" Several participants noted that their assessments of appropriate monetary policy reflected the subpar pace of the economic expansion and the persistent shortfall in aggregate demand since the 2007–09 recession, and two commented that the neutral level of the federal funds rate was likely somewhat below its historical norm."
 One participant expressed concern that a protracted period of very accommodative monetary policy could lead to a buildup of risks in the financial system.
" Participants also noted that because the appropriate stance of monetary policy depends importantly on the evolution of real activity and inflation over time, their assessments of the appropriate future path of the federal funds rate and the balance sheet could change if economic conditions were to evolve in an unexpected manner."
 Those who judged that a longer period of very accommodative monetary policy would be appropriate generally projected that the unemployment rate would remain further above its longerrun normal level at the end of 2014.
" In contrast, the 6 participants who judged that policy firming should begin in 2012 or 2013 indicated that the Committee would need to act soon to keep inflation near the FOMC’s longerrun objective of 2 percent and to prevent a rise in inflation expectations."
"Uncertainty and Risks Nearly all participants judged  that their current level of uncertainty about GDP growth and unemployment was higher than was the norm during the previous 20 years (figure 4).1  About half of all participants judged the level of uncertainty associated with their inflation forecasts to be higher as well, while another eight participants viewed uncertainty about inflation as broadly similar to historical norms."
" The main factors cited as underlying the elevated uncertainty about economic outcomes were the ongoing fiscal and financial situation in Europe, the outlook for fiscal policy in the United States, and a general slowdown in global economic growth, including the possibility of a significant slowdown in China."
" Several commented that in the aftermath of the financial crisis, they were more uncertain about the level of potential output and its trend rate of growth."
"A majority of participants reported that they saw the risks to their forecasts of real GDP growth as weighted toward the downside and, accordingly, the risks to their                                                   1 Table 2 provides estimates of the forecast uncertainty for the change in real GDP, the unemployment rate, and total consumer price inflation over the period from 1992 to 2011."
projections of the unemployment rate as tilted to the upside.
" The most frequently identified sources of risk were the situation in Europe, which many participants thought had the potential to slow global economic activity, particularly over the near term, and the fiscal situation in the United States."
"Most participants continued to judge the risks to their projections for inflation as broadly balanced, with several highlighting the recent stability of inflation expectations."
" However, five participants saw the risks to inflation as tilted to the downside, a larger number than in April; a couple of them no ted that slack in resource markets could turn out to be greater or could put more downward pressure on inflation than they were anticipating."
" Two participants saw the risks to inflation as weighted to the upside, in light of concerns about U.S. fiscal imbalances, the current highly accommodative stance of monetary policy, or the Committee’s ability to effectively remove policy accommodation when it becomes appropriate to do so."

" As described in the box “Forecast Uncertainty,” under certain assumptions, there is about a 70 percent proba bility that actual outcomes for real GDP, unemployment, and consumer prices will be in ranges implied by the average size of projection errors made in  the past."

" Thus, in setting the stance of monetary policy, participants consider no t only what appears to be the most likely economic outcome as embodied in their projections, but also the range of alternative possibilities, the likelihood of their occurring, and the potential costs to the economy should they occur."
"Table 2 summarizes the average historical accuracy of a range of forecasts, including those reported in past Monetary Policy Report s and those prepared by the Federal Reserve Board’s staff in advance of meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee."
" The corresponding 70 percent confidence intervals for overall inflation would be 1.2 to 2.8 percent in the current year, 1.0 to 3.0 percent in the second year, and 0.9 to      3.1 percent in the third year."
"As with real activity and inflation, the outlook for the future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable uncertainty."
 This uncertainty arises primarily because each participant’s assessment of the appropriate stance of monetary policy depends importantly on the evolution of real activity and inflation over time.
