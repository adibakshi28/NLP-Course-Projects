2 Attended through the discussi on of the review of the monetary policy framework.
"Koenig,2 Paula Tkac, and Mark L.J. Wright, Senior Vice Presidents, Federal Reserve Banks of St. Louis, Dallas, Dallas, Atlanta, and Minneapolis, respectively   Jonas Fisher, Giovanni Olivei, Giorgio Topa, and Patricia Zobel, Vice Presidents, Federal Reserve Banks of Chicago, Boston, New York, and New York, respectively   Jonas Arias,2 Thorsten Drautzburg,2 and Leonardo Melosi,2 Senior Economists, Federal Reserve Banks of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, and Chicago, respectively  Fernando Duarte,2 Financial Economist, Federal Reserve Bank of New York  Review of Monetary Policy Strategy, Tools, and Communication Practices Committee participants continued their discussions related to the ongoing review of the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy strategy, tools, and communication practices."
" The staff’s analysis suggested that the ELB would likel y bind in most future recessions, which could make it more difficult for the FOMC to achieve its longerrun objectives of maximum employment and symmetric 2 percent inflation."
 6 Attended the discussion of th e review of the monetary policy framework through the end of the meeting.
" Under such strategies, policymakers would promise to make up for past inflation shortfalls with a sustained accommodative stance of policy that is intend ed to generate higher future inflation."
" Because of their properties both at and away from the ELB, makeup strategies may also more firmly anchor inflation expectations at 2 percent than a policy strategy that does not compensate for past inflation misses."
"Participants generally agreed with the staff’s analysis that the risk of future ELB episodes had likely increased over time, and that future ELB episodes and the reduced effect of resource utilization on inflation could inhibit the Committee’s ability to achieve its employment and inflation objectives."
 The increased ELB risk was attributed in part to structural changes in the U.S. economy that had lowered the longerrun real shortterm interest rate and thus the neutral level of the policy rate.
" In light of a low neut ral rate and shortfalls of inflation below the 2 percent objective for several years, some participants raised the concern that the policy space to reduce the federal funds rate in response to future recessions could be comp ressed further if inflation shortfalls continued and led to a decline in inflation expectations, a risk that was also  discussed in the staff analysis."
" These participants pointed to long, ongoing ELB spells in other major foreign economies and suggested that, to avoid similar circumstances in the United States, it was important to be aggressive when confronted with forces holding inflation below objective."
 A couple of participants judged that the lack of monetary policy space abroad and the possibilit y that fiscal space in the United States might be limited reinforced the case for strengthening the FOMC’s monetary policy framework as a matter of prudent planning.
"With regard to the current monetary policy framework, participants agreed that th is framework served the Committee well in the aftermath of the financial crisis."
Participants generally agreed that the current framework also served the Committee well by providing a strong commitment to achieving the Committee’s maximumemployment and symmetric infl ation objectives.
" Because of the downside risk to inflation and employment associated with the ELB, most participants were open to the possibility that the dualmandate objectives of maximum employment and stable prices could be best served by strategies that deliver inflation rates that over time are, on average, equal to the Committee’s longerrun objective of 2 percent."
" Promoting such outcomes may require aiming for inflation somewhat above 2 percent when the policy rate was away from the ELB, recognizing that inflation would tend to be lower than 2 percent when the policy rate was constrained by the ELB."
" Participants suggested several alternatives for doing so, including strategies th at make up for past inflation shortfalls and those that respond more aggressively to belowtarget inflation than to abovetarget inflation."
" In this context, several participants suggested that the adoption of a target range for inflation could be helpful in achieving the Committee’s objective of 2 percent inflation, on average, as it could help communicate to the public that periods in which the Committee judged inflation to be moderately away from its 2 percent objective were appropriate."
 A couple of participants suggested analyzing policies in which there was a target range for inflation whose midpoint was modestly higher than 2 percent or in which 2 percent was an inflation floor; these policies  might enhance policymakers’ scope to provide accommodation as appropriate when the neutral real interest rate was low.
"Although ensuring inflation outcomes averaging 2 percent over time was seen as important, many participants noted that the illustrated ma keup strategies delivered only modest benefits in the staff’s model simulations."
" These modest benefits in part reflected that the responsiveness of inflation to resource slack had diminished, making it more difficult to  provide sufficient accommodation to push inflation back to the Committee’s objective in a timely manner."
" In addition, several participants noted that the implementation of the makeup strategies in the form of either average inflation targeting or pricelevel targeting in the simulations was tied too rigidly to the details of particular rules."
 Some particip ants raised the concern that the effective use of the makeup strategies in the form of the average inflation targeting and pricelevel targeting rules that the staff presented depended on future policymakers following through on commitments to keep policy accommodative for a long time.
" Such commitments might be difficult for future policymakers to follow through on, especially in situations in which the labor market was strong and inflation was above target."
" However, they pointed to the commitments that central banks around the world made to inflation targeting as examples in which similar challenges had been overcome."
" However, a couple of other participants judged that macroprudential tools could be used to help ensure that any overleveraging of households and firms did not threaten the financial system, while monetary policy needed to be focused on achieving maximum employment and symmetric 2 percent inflation."
" A few participants viewed the communication challenges associated with averageinflation targeting strategies, including the difficulty of conveying the dangers of low inflation to the public, as greater than for some other strategies that use thresholdbased forward guidance."
 Several participants noted that makeup stra tegies could unduly limit the policy response in situations in which inflation had been running above 2 percent amid signs of an impending economic downturn.
" Accord ingly, these participants favored makeup strategies that only reversed past inflation shortfalls relative to ma keup strategies that reversed both past inflation shortfalls and past overruns."
"Participants continued to di scuss the benefits of the Committee’s review of the monetary policy framework as well as the Committee’s Statement on LongerRun Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, which articulates the Committee’s approach to monetary policy."
" These issues included the c onduct of monetary policy in the presence of the ELB constr aint, the role of inflation expectations in the Committee’s pursuit of its inflation goal, the best means of conveying the Committee’s balanced approach to monetary policy, the symmetry of its inflation goal, and the time frame over which the Committee aimed to achieve it."
" Global financial markets were volatile over the intermeeting period, with market participants reacting to incoming information about U.S.–China trade tensions and the global growth outlook."
" In an environment of greater perceived uncertainty about potential outflows re lated to the corporate tax payment date, typical lenders in money markets were less willing to accommodate incr eased dealer demand for funding."
 Federal Home Loan Banks reportedly scaled back their lending in the federal funds market in order to maintain some liquidity in anticipation of higher demand for advances from their members and to shift more of their overnight fundin g into repo.
" Consumer price inflation, as measured by the 12month percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), was below 2 percent in July."
 Surveybased measures of longerrun inflation expectations were little changed.
"Total nonfarm payroll employment expanded at a solid pace in July and August, although at a slower rate than in the first half of the year."
" (Separately, the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ preliminary estimate of the upcoming benchmark revision to payroll employment, which will be incorporated in the published data in February 2020, indicated that the revised pace of average monthly job gains from April 2018 to Ma rch 2019 would be notably slower than in the current published data.)  The unemployment rate remained at 3.7 percent through August, and both the labor force participation rate and the employment-topopulation ratio moved up."
" The unemployment rates for African Americans and Hispanics declined over July and August, while the rates for whites and Asians increased; the unemployment rate for each group was below its level at the end of the previous economic expansion, though persistent differentials between these rates remained."
 Both the rate of privatesector job openings and the rate of quits moved roughly sideways in June and July and were still at relatively high levels ; the fourweek moving average of initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits through early September was near historically low levels.
" This increase was slower than a year earlier, as core PCE price inflation (which excludes changes in consumer food and energy prices) moved down to 1.6 percent, consumer food price inflation remained below core inflation, and consumer energy prices declined."
" The average monthly change in core PCE prices in recent months was faster than earlier this year, suggesting that the soft inflation readings during the earlier period were transitory."
 The trimmed mean measure of  12month PCE price inflation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas remained at 2 percent in July.
" The consumer price index (CPI) rose 1.7 percent over the 12 months ending in August, while core CPI inflation was 2.4 percent."
 Recent surveybased measures of longerrun inflation expectations were little changed on balance.
" The preliminary September reading from the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers dipped after edging up in August, but it remained within its recent range; the measures of longerrun inflation expectations from the Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants were little changed."
" Real PCE rose briskly in July, while the components of the nominal retail sales data used by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) to estimate PCE were flat in August and the rate of sales of light motor vehicles only edged up, suggesting some slowing in consumer spending growth in the third quarter from its strong secondquarter pace."
" Key factors that influence consumer spending—including a low unemployment rate, further gains in real disposable income, high levels of households’ net worth, and generally low borrowing rates—were supportive of solid real PCE growth in the near term."
" Orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft increased in Ju ne but were still below the level of shipments, most measures of business sentiment deteriorated, analysts’ expectat ions of firms’ longerterm profit growth declined further, and trade policy concerns continued to weigh on firms’ investment decisions."
 The nominal U.S. international trade deficit remained about unchanged in June before narrowing in July.
 The BEA estimated that the change in net exports was a drag of about ¾ percentage point on real GDP growth in the second quarter.
Foreign economic growth remained subdued in the second quarter.
" Growth picked up in Canada as oil production rebounded, but growth slowed sharply in Europe amid a downturn in manufacturing activity and persistent policyrelated uncertainty."
 Growth also slowed in China and India.
" Foreign inflation rose in the second quarter, pushed up by earlier increases in oil prices as well as by rising food prices in some emerging economies."
" However, data on foreign core consumer prices showed little sign of underlying inflationary pressures abroad."
"Staff Review of the Financial Situation  Financial market developments over the intermeeting period were driven by an escalation in international trade tensions, growing concerns a bout the global economic growth outlook, and the prospect of more policy accommodation by central banks."
 Financing conditions for businesses and households were largely unaffected by the intermeeting turbulence in financial markets and remained generally supportive of spending and economic activity.
 Measures of inflation compensation derived from Treasury InflationProtected Securities declined on net.
" Conversely, the stock prices of utilities and real estate firms increased noticeably, reportedly benefiting from demand by investors reaching for less cyclical and higheryielding assets."
" Some weakness in foreign economic data, growing concerns about global growth, and the prospect of more monetary policy accommodation abroad contributed to further d eclines in yields."
" Growth of commercial and industrial loans at banks ticked up, driven by faster growth at large domestic banks."
" Bank CRE loan growth slowed mo derately since the second quarter, driven by slower growth in loans secured by nonfarm nonresidential properties."
" The volume of agency and nonagency commercial mortgagebacked securities issuance was slightly weaker in July and August than in the same period last year, though industry analysts reportedly anticipated that issuance would soon pick up in response to recent declines in interest rates."
" Residential mortgage rates declined less than longterm Treasury yields, as the increase in prepayment risk and the rise in implied interest rate volatility reported ly reduced the demand for mortgagebacked securities."
"Financing conditions in consumer credit markets remained generally supportive of growth in consumer spending, although supply conditions continued to be tight for subprime credit card borrowers."
" Consumer credit expanded at a modera te pace in the second quarter overall, with bank credit data pointing to continued growth through July and August."
"Staff Economic Outlook The projection for U.S. economic activity prepared by the staff for the September FOMC meeting was little changed in the near term; real GDP growth was still forecast to be slower in the second half of the year than in the first half, mostly attr ibutable to co ntinued soft business investment and a sl ower increase in government spending."
" The projection for real GDP growth over the medium term was a bit weaker than the previous forecast, primarily reflecting the effects of a higher projected path for the foreign exchange value of the dollar and a lower trajectory for economic growth abroad, which were partially offset by a lower assumed path for interest rates."
 Real GDP was forecast to expand at a rate a little above the staff’s estimate of potential output Page 8 Federal Open Market Committee____________________________________________________________________________________________ _ growth in 2019 and 2020 and th en slow to a pace slightly below potential output growth in 2021 and 2022.
" The unemployment rate was projected to be roughly flat through 2022 and to remain below the staff’s estimate of its longerrun natural rate, which was revised down a little."
" In addition, the staff revised up its estimate of the level of trend productivity in recent years after incorporating the BEA’s recent annual revisions to the national income and product accounts."
" The staff’s forecast of total PCE price inflation for this year was revised down somewh at, reflecting slightly lower projected paths for consumer food and energy prices, along with a little lower forecast for core PCE prices."
 The core PCE price inflation forecast for this year was revised down to reflect recent data as well as downwardrevised data for ea rlier in the year from the BEA’s annual revision.
" Both total and core inflation were projected to move up slightly next year, as the low readings early this year were expected to be transitory; nevertheless, both inflation measures were forecast to continue to run below 2 percent through 2022."
"The staff continued to view the uncertainty around its projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as generally  similar to the average of the past 20 years."
" Moreover, the staff still judged that the risks to the forecast for real GDP growth were tilted to the downside, with a corresponding skew to the upside for the unemployment rate."
" In  addition, softness in business investment and manufacturing so far this year was seen as pointing to the possibility of a more substantial slowing in economic growth than the staff projected."
" The risks to the inflation projection were also viewed as having a downward skew, in part because of the downside risks to the forecast for economic activity Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook  In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, members of the Board of Governors and Federal Reserve Bank presidents submitted their projec tions of the most likely outcomes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2019 through 2022 and over the longer run, based on their individual assessments of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate."
" The longerrun projections represented each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy."
 Participants agreed that th e labor market had remained strong over the intermeeting period and that economic activity had risen at a moderate rate.
" Job gains had been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate had remained low."
" On a 12month basis, overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy were running below 2 percent."
 Marketbased measures of inflation compensation remained low; surveybased measures of longerterm inflation expectations were little changed.
Participants generally viewed the baseline economic outlook as positive and indicated that their views of the most likely outcomes for economic activity and inflation had changed little since the July meeting.
" In addition, inflation pressures continued to be muted."
 Many partic ipants expected  that real GDP growth would moderate to around its potential rate in the second half of the year.
" With regard to the contrast between robust consumption growth and weak investment growth, several participants mentioned that uncertainties in the business outlook and sustained weak investment could eventually lead to slower hiring, which, in turn, could damp the growth of income and consumption."
" A few participants noted ongoing challenges in the agricultural  sector, including those associated with tariffs, weak export demand, and more intense financial burdens arising from the increase in carryover debt in preceding year s."
" Participants judged that cond itions in the labor market remained strong, with the unemployment rate near historical lows and continued solid  job gains, on average, in recent months."
" The labor force participation rate of primeage individuals, especially of primeage women, moved up in August, continuing its upward trajectory, and the unemployment rate of African Americans fell to its lowest rate on record."
" However, a number of participants noted that, although the labor market was clearly in a strong position, the preliminary benchmark revision by the Bureau of Labor Statistics indicated that payroll employment gains would likely show less momentum coming into this year when  the revisions are incorporated in published data early next year."
" That said, reports from business contacts in many Districts pointed to continued strong labor demand, with so me firms still reporting difficulties finding qualified workers and others broadening their recruiting to include traditionally marginalized groups."
" In some Districts, employers were also expanding training and provision of nonwage benefits, which could help sustain their expansion of hiring against a background of a very tight national labor market without spurring abovetrend aggregate wage growth."
 Participants generally viewed overall wage growth as broadly consistent with modest average rates of labor productivity growth in recent years and as exerting little upward pressure on inflation.
" A couple of part icipants noted that, with inflationary pressures remain ing muted and wage growth moderate even as employment and spending expanded further, they had again adjusted downward their estimates of the longerrun normal unemployment rate."
"In their discussion of inflation developments, participants noted that, despite a recent firming in the incoming data, readings on overall and core PCE inflation had continued to run below the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective."
" Furthermore, in light of weakness in the global economy, perceptions of downside risks to growth, and subdued inflation pressures, some participants continued to view the risks to the outlook for inflation as weighted to the downside."
" Some participants, however, saw the recent inflation data as consistent with their previous assessment that much of the weakness seen early in the year was transitory."
" In this connection, several participants noted that recent monthly readings, notably for CPI inflation, seemed broadly consistent with the Committee’s longerrun inflation objective of 2 percent, while the trimmed mean measure of PCE inflation, constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, remained at 2 percent in July."
"  In their discussion of the outlook for inflation, participants generally agreed that, under appropriate policy, inflation would move up to th e Committee’s 2 percent objective over the medium term."
" Participants saw inflation expectations as reasonably well anchored, but many participants observed that marketbased measures of inflation compensation and some survey measures of consumers’ inflation expectations were at historically low levels."
" Some of these part icipants further noted that longerterm inflation expectations could be somewhat below levels consistent with  the Committee’s 2 percent inflation objective, or that continued weakness in inflation could prompt expectations to drift lower."
"Participants generally judged that downside risks to the outlook for economic activity had increased somewhat since their July meeting, particularly those stemming from trade policy uncertainty and conditions abroad."
" Participants observed that a key source of downward pressure on Treasury rates arose from flightto-safety flows, driven by downside risks to global growth, escalating trade tensions, and disappointing global data."
 Low interest rates abroad were also considered an important influence on U.S. longerterm rates.
"In their consideration of th e monetary policy options at this meeting, most participan ts believed that a reduction of 25 basis points in the target range for the federal funds rate would be appropriate."
" In discussing the reasons for such a decision, these partic ipants pointed to considerations related to the economic  outlook, risk management, and the need to center inflation and inflation expectations on the Committee’s longerrun objective of 2 percent."
" Several also noted that, because monetary policy actions affected economic activity with a lag, it was appropriate to provide the requisite policy accommodation now to support economic activity over coming quarters."
Participants favoring a modest adjustment to the stance of monetary policy at this juncture cited other risks to the economic outlook that further underscored the case for such a move.
" As their discussion of risks had highlighted, downside risks had become more pronounced since July:  Trade uncertainty had increased, prospects for global growth had become more fragile, and various intermeeting developments had intensified geopolitical risks."
" In addition , a number of participants suggested that a reduction at this meeting in the target range for the federal funds rate would likely better align the target range with a variety of indicators of the appropriate policy stance, including those based on estimates of the neutral interest rate."
Many participants also cited the level of inflation or inflation expectations as justifying a reduction of 25 basis points in the federal funds rate at this meeting.
" Inflation had generally fallen short of the Committee’s objective Minutes of the Meeting of September 17–18, 2019 Page 11 ____________________________________________________________________________________________ _ for several years and, notwithstanding some stronger recent monthly readings on in flation, the 12month rate was still below 2 percent."
 Some estimates of trend inflation were also below 2 percent.
 Several participants additionally stressed that survey measures of longerterm inflation expectations and mark etbased measures of inflation compensation were near historical lows and that these values pointed to the possibility that inflation expectations were below levels consistent with the 2 percent objective or could soon fall below such levels.
" With inflation pressures muted and U.S. inflation likely being weighed down by global disinflationary forces, policymakers saw little chance of  an outsized increase in inflation in response to additional policy accommodation and argued that such an increase, should it occur, could be addressed in a st raightforward manner using conventional monetary policy tools."
" In this connection, a couple of participants suggested that, if it decided to provide more policy accommodation at the present juncture, the Committee might be  taking out too much insurance against possible future shocks, leaving monetary policy with less scope to boost aggregate demand in the event that such shocks materialized."
 A few of the participants favoring an unchanged target range for the federal funds rate also expressed concern that an easing of monetary policy at this meeting could exacerbate financial imbalances.
" These participants suggested that a larger policy move would help reduce the risk of an economic downturn and would more appropriately recognize important recent developments, such as slowing job gains, weakening investment, and continue d low values of marketbased measures of inflation compensation."
" In addition, these participants stressed the need for a policy stance—possibly one using enhanced forward guidance—that was sufficiently accommodative to make it unlikely that the United States would experience a protracted period of the kind seen abroad in  which the economy became mired in a combination of undesirably low inflation, weak economic activity, and nearzero policy rates."
 They also argued that it was desirable for the Committee to seek and maintain a level of accommodation sufficient to deliver inflation at 2 percent on a sustained basis and that such a policy would be consistent with inflation exceeding 2 percent for a time.
"With regard to monetary policy beyond this meeting, participants agreed that policy was not on a preset course and would depend on the implications of incoming information for the evolution of  the economic outlook."
  Page 12 Federal Open Market Committee____________________________________________________________________________________________ _ Participants agreed that developments in money markets over recent days implied that the Committee should soon discuss the appropriate level of reserve balances sufficient to support efficient and effective implementation of monetary policy in the context of the amplere-serves regime that the Committee had chosen.
 A few participants noted the possibility of resuming trend growth of the balance sheet to  help stabilize the level of reserves in the banking system.
 Participants agreed that any Committee decision regarding the trend pace of balance sheet expansion necessary to maintain a level of reserve balances appropriate to facilitate policy implementation should be clearly distinguished from past largescale asset purchase programs that were aimed at altering the size and composition of the Federal Reserve’s asset holdings in order to provide monetary policy accommodation and ease overall financ ial conditions.
 Several participants suggested that such a discussion could benefit from also considering the merits of introducing a standing repurchase agreement facility as part of the framework for implementing monetary policy.
"Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary  policy for this meeting, members noted that information received since the July meeting indicated that the labor market remained strong and that economic activity had been rising at a moderate rate."
" Job gains had been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate had remained low."
" However, business fixed investment and exports had weakened, and this outcome su ggested that risks and uncertainty associated with in ternational trade developments and with ongoing weakness in global economic growth were continuing to weigh on the domestic economy."
" On a 12month basis, both the overall inflation rate and inflation for items other than food and energy were running below 2 percent."
 Marketbased measures of inflation compensation remained low.
 Surveybased measures of longerterm inflation expectations were little changed.
"With this adjustment to pol icy, those members who supported the policy action sought to make the overall stance of monetary policy most consistent with helping to offset the effects on aggregate demand of weak global growth and trade policy uncertainty, insure against further downside risks arising from those sources and from geopolitical developments, and promote a more rapid return of inflation to the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective than would otherwise occur."
" A couple of these members observed that, because monetary policy actions affected aggregate spending with a lag, the present meeting was an appropriate occasion for providing accommodation that would support economic activity in the period ahead."
" These members noted that economic data received over the intermeeting period had been largely positive and that they anticipated, under an unchanged policy stance, continued strong labor markets and solid growth in activity, with inflation gradually moving up to the Committee’s 2 percent objective."
 These members also suggested that providing further accommodation during a period of high economic activity and elevated asset prices could have adverse consequences for financial stability.
" This member suggested that such a larger rate adjustment would be more consistent with the achievement of the Committee’s objectives over time and, in particular, with he lping preclude the possibility of a protracted period in which inflation and employment were below the Committee’s objectives."
"Members agreed that, in determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee would assess realized and expected economic conditions  relative to its maximumemployment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective."
" They also agreed that those assessments would take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
The Committee also directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve’s agency mortgagebacked securities transactions.” The vote also encompassed ap proval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p.m.: “Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in July indicates that the labor market remains strong and that economic activity has been rising at a moderate rate.
" Job gains have been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low."
" On a  12month basis, overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy are running below 2 percent."
 Marketbased measures of inflation compensation remain low; surveybased measures of longerterm inflation expectations are little changed.
"Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
" This action supports the Committee’s view that sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective are the most likely outcomes, but uncertainties about this outlook rema in."
" As the Committee contemplates the future path of the target range for the federal funds rate,  it will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion, with a strong labor market and inflation near its symmetric 2 percent objective."
"In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic condit ions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective."
" This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.” Voting for this action:   Jerome H."
President Bullard dissented because he believed that lowering the target range for the federal funds rate by 50 basis points at this time would provide insurance against further declines in expected inflation and a slowing economy subject to elevated downside risks.
" In addition, a 50 basis point cut at this time would help promote a more rapid return of inflation and inflation expectations to target."
 President George dissented because she believed that an unchanged setting of policy was appropriate based on incoming data and the outlook for economic activity over the medium term.
 President Rosengren dissented because he judged that monetary policy was already acco mmodative.
"Consistent with the Committee’s decision to lower the target range for the federal funds rate to 1¾ to 2 percent, the Board of Governors voted unanimously to lower the interest rate paid on required and excess reserve balances to 1.80 percent and voted unanimously to approve a ¼ percentage point decrease in the primary credit rate to 2.50 percent, effective September 19, 2019.It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday–Wednesday, October 29–30, 2019."
"Clouse Secretary Minutes of the Meeting of September 17–18, 2019 Page 15 ____________________________________________________________________________________________ _ Summary of Economic Projections  In conjunction with the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting held on September 17–18, 2019, meeting participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real gross domestic product (GDP) growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2019 to 2022 and over the longer run."
" Each participant’s projections were based on information available at the time of the meeting, together with his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy—including a path for the federal funds rate and its longerrun value—and assumptions about other factors likely to affect economic outcomes."
" The longerrun projections represent each participant’s assessment of the value to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy.1  “Appropriate monetary policy” is defined as the future path of policy that each participant deems most likely to foster outcomes for economic activity and inflation that best satisfy his or her individual interpretation of the statutory mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability."
"  Participants who submitted longerrun projections expected that, under appropriate monetary policy, growth of real GDP in 2019 would run slightly or somewhat above their individual estimates of its longerrun rate."
" Participants expected real GDP growth to edge down over the projection horizon, with all participants projecting growth in 2022 to be at or modestly below their estimates of its longerrun rate."
 Almost all participants who submitted longerrun projections expected that the unemployment rate through 2022 would run below their estimates of its longerrun level.
 The vast majority of participants expected that inflation would be at or slightly above the Committee’s 2 percent obje ctive in 2021 and 2022.
" The median of participants’ projections for core PCE price inflation increased over the projection period, rising to 2.0 percent in 2021."
" Compared with the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) from June                                                             1 One participant did not submit longerrun projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, or the federal funds rate."
"2019, some participants slight ly revised down their estimates of the longerrun unemployment rate; the median estimate of the longerrun unemployment rate was unchanged."
 Participants’ projections for total and core inflation were generally little changed compared with their projections in June.
"  As shown in figure 2, partic ipants expected that the evolution of the economy, relative to their objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation, would likely warrant a federal funds rate target by the end of this year at or below the target range that the Committee adopted at its July 30–31 m eeting."
"  Most participants regarded the uncertainties around their forecasts for GDP growth, total inflation, and core inflation as broadly similar to  the average over the past 20 years."
" Just over half of the participants viewed the level of uncertainty around their unemployment rate projections as being similar to the average of the past 20 years, while the rest of the participants viewed uncertainty as higher."
 Most participants assessed the risks to their outlooks for real GDP growth as weighted to the downside and for the unemploy ment rate as weighted to the upside.
" Most participants judged the risks to the inflation outlook as broadly balanced; some participants viewed the risks to inflation as weighted to the downside, and no participant a ssessed risks to inflation as weighted to the upside."

" The Outlook for Real GDP Growth and Unemployment As shown in table 1, the median of participants’ projections for the growth rate of real GDP in 2019, conditional on their individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy, was 2.2 percent, a bit above the median estimate of its longerrun rate of 1.9 percent."
" Almost all participants contin ued to expect GDP growth to slow over the projection period, with the median projection at 2.0 percent in 2020, 1.9 percent in 2021, and 1.8 percent in 2022."
" Relative to th e June SEP, the medians of the projections for real GDP growth in 2019, 2020, 2021, and the longer run were unchanged or revised slightly higher."
" The median of projections for the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of 2019 was 3.7 percent, ½ percentage point below the median assessment of its longerrun level of 4.2 percent."
" The median projected unemployment rate for 2019 was slightly higher than in the June SEP, while the median projected unemployment rates for 2020 and 2021 were unchanged relative to the June SEP."
" A vast majority of participants who submitted longerrun projections expected that the unemployment rate in 2022 would be below their estimates of its longerrun level, with some participants projecting a gap of ½ percentage point or more."
"  Figures 3.A and 3.B show the distributions of participants’ projections for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate, respectively , from 2019 to 2022 and in the longer run."
 The distribution of individual projections for real GDP growth for 2019 shifted up somewhat relative to that in the June SEP.
 The distributions of individual projections of real GDP growth for 2020 and 2021 and for the longer ru n were little changed overall.
 The distributions of individual projections for the unemployment rate for 2019 to 2021 and for the longer run were also little changed overall relative to those in June.
"  The Outlook for Inflation As shown in table 1, the median of projections for total PCE price inflation was 1.5 percent in 2019, 1.9 percent in 2020, and 2.0 percent in 2021; these medians were unchanged from June."
 The medians of projections for core PCE price inflation were 1.8 percent for 2019 and 1.9 percent for 2020.
 Th e median projections for core inflation for 2021 and 20 22 were 2.0 percent.
  Figures 3.C and 3.D provide information on the distributions of participants’ views about the outlook for inflation.
" The distributions of projections for total and core PCE price inflation in 2019, 2020, and 2021 were little changed overall relative to those in June."
" For 2022, all participants projected total and core inflation between 1.8 and 2.2 percent."

" As a reference, table 2 provides measures of forecast uncertainty—based on the forecast errors of various private and government forecasts over the past 20 years—for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and total PCE price inflation."
"Participants’ assessments of the level of uncertainty surrounding their individual economic projections are shown in the bottomleft panels of figures 4.A, 4.B, and 4.C.  Most participants continued to view the uncertainties around their forecasts for GDP growth, total inflation, and core inflation as broadly similar to the average over the past 20 years."
" Just over half of the participants viewed the level of uncertainty around their unemployment rate projections as being similar to the average of the past 20 years, while the rest of the participants viewed uncertainty as higher.2   Because the fan charts are constructed to be symmetric around the median projecti ons, they do not reflect any asymmetries in the balance of risks that participants may see in their economic projections."
" Participants’ assessments of the balance of risks to their current economic projections are shown in the bottomright panels of figures 4.A, 4.B, and 4.C.  Most participants continued to view the risks to their outlooks for real GDP growth as weighted to the downside and for the unemployment rate as weighted to the upside."
" Most participants—four more than in the June SEP—judged the risks to the inflation outlook as broadly balanced; some participants viewed the risks to inflation as weighted to the downside, and no participants assessed risks to inflation as weighted to the upside."

" As described in the box “Forecast Uncertainty,” under certain assumptions, there is about a 70 percent probability that actual outcomes for real GDP, unemployment, consumer prices, and the federal funds rate will be in ranges implied by the aver age size of projection errors made in the past."
" In discussing the uncertainty and risks surrounding their economic projections, several participants mentioned trade developments, concerns  about foreign economic growth, and weaker business fixed investment as sources of uncertainty or downside risk to the U.S. economic growth outlook."
" For the in flation outlook, the possibility that inflation expectations could be drifting below levels consistent with the FOMC’s 2 percent inflation objective and the potential for weaker domestic demand to put downward pressure on inflation were viewed as downside risks."
 A few part icipants noted the possibility that higher tariffs could lead to aggregate price pressure as a source of upside risk to inflation.

"The conﬁdence interval is not strictly consistent with theprojections for the federal funds rate, primarily because these projections are not forecasts of the likeliest outcomes forthe federal funds rate, but rather projections of participants’ individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy.Still, historical forecast errors provide a broad sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rategenerated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policythat may be appropriate to oﬀset the eﬀects of shocks to the economy.The conﬁdence interval is assumed to be symmetric except when it is truncated at zero - the bottom of the lowesttarget range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted in the past by the Committee."
This truncation wouldnot be intended to indicate the likelihood of the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary policyaccommodation if doing so was judged appropriate.
"Because currentconditions may diﬀer from those that prevailed, on average, over the previous 20 years, the width and shape of theconﬁdence interval estimated on the basis of the historical forecast errors may not reﬂect FOMC participants’ currentassessments of the uncertainty and risks around their projections.* The conﬁdence interval is derived from forecasts of the average level of shortterm interest rates in the fourthquarter of the year indicated; more information about these data is available in table 2."
The shaded area encompassesless than a 70 percent conﬁdence interval if the conﬁdence interval has been truncated at zero.Page 16 Federal Open Market Committee____________________________________________________________________________________________ _ Forecast Uncertainty The economic projections provided by the members of the Board of Governors and th e presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks inform discussi ons of monetary policy among policymakers and can aid public understanding of the basis for policy actions.
" Thus, in setting the stance of monetary policy, participants consider not only what appears to be the most likely economic outcome as embodied in their projections, but also the range of alternative possibilities, the likelihood of their occurring, and the potential costs to the economy should they occur."
"Table 2 summarizes the averag e historical accuracy of a range of forecasts, includ ing those reported in past Monetary Policy Report s and those prepared by the Federal Reserve Board’s staff in advance of me etings of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)."
" The corresponding 70 percent confidence  intervals for overall inflation would be 1.2 to 2.8 percent in the current year, 1.0 to 3.0 percent in the second year, 0.9 to 3.1 percent in the third year, and 1.0 to 3.0 percent in the fourth year."
" Figures 4.A through 4.C illustrate these confidence bounds in “fan charts” that are symmetric an d centered on the medians of FOMC participants’ projections for GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation."
" In particular, the unemployment rate cannot be negative; furthermore, the risks around a particular projection might be tilted to either the upside or the downside, in which case the corresponding fan chart would be asymmetrically positioned around the median projection."
" These judgments are summarized in the lowerright panels of figures 4.A through 4.C. As with real activity and inflation, the outlook for the future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable uncertainty."
 This uncertainty arises primarily because each participant’s assessment of the appropriate stance of monetary policy depends importantly on the evolution of real activity and inflation over time.
" However, the fo recast errors should provide a sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as addi tional adjustment s to monetary policy that would be appropriat e to offset the effects of shocks to the economy."
 This a pproach to the construction of the federal funds rate fan chart would be merely a convention; it would not have any implicat ions for possible future policy decisions regarding the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary polic y accommodation if doing so were appropriate.
