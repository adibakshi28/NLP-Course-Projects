3 Attended the discussion of longerrun goals and monetary policy strategy.
" In the first proposal, the Desk would vary by modest amounts the interest rate on ON RRP operations according to a preannounced schedule."
 Varying the spread between the ON RRP rate and the interest on excess reserves rate could provide the Committee with information about the effect of that spread on money markets and the demand for ON RRP.
Staff Review of the Economic Situation   The information reviewed for the October 28–29 meeting indicated that economic activity expanded at a moderate pace in the third quarter and that labor market conditions improved over the intermeeting period.
 Consumer price inflation continued to run below the FOMC’s longerrun objective of 2 percent.
" Marketbased measures of inflation compensation declined somewhat, while surveybased measures of longerterm inflation expectations  remained stable."
"Total nonfarm payroll employment rose in September and the gains for July and Au gust were revised up, leaving the average increase in the third quarter similar to Minutes of the Meeting of October 28–29, 2014Page 3_____________________________________________________________________________________________that for the first half of the year."
" In September, the unemployment rate declined to 5.9 percent, and the share of workers employed part time for economic reasons decreased a little."
" The labor force participation rate edged down, and the employmentto-population ratio remained essentially unchanged."
" Although the rate of gross privatesector hiring declined, the rate of job openings moved up, measures of firms’ hiring plans increased, initial claims for unemployment insurance remained low, and some measures of household expectations for labor market conditions improved."
The U.S. international trade deficit narrowed slightly in August.
"Total U.S. consumer price inflation, as measured by the PCE price index, was about 1½ percen t over the             12 months ending in August."
" Nearterm inflation expectations from the Michigan survey declined in September and early October, while longerterm inflation expectations in the survey were little changed."
" In Japan, consumption staged a mild rebound after contracting in the previous quarter in response to a tax increase, while indicators for the euro area  pointed to only continued sluggish growth."
" Thirdquarter growth in real gross domestic product (GDP) remained healthy in the United Kingdom, and indicators for Canada also were positive."
" Among emerging market ec onomies, GDP growth remained strong in the third quarter in China and Korea and indicators for Mexico we re favorable as well."
" Foreign inflation remained generall y subdued and in some regions quite low, especially in the euro area, where headline inflation was well below 1 percent."
" In addition, a number of technical factors reportedly contributed to volatile interest rate moves in midOctober."
" While the release of the somewhat weakerthan-            expected data for September U.S. retail sales was seen as the trigger for these sharp movements, market participants indicated that a number of technical factors related to investor positioning and trading strategies likely amplified the swing in interest rates."
" Marketbased measures of inflation compensation moved lower as well, extendin g the declines seen since the summer."
" The decline in inflation compensation reportedly reflected in part concerns about global growth and the risk of building disinflationary pressures, the lowerthan-expected August CPI report, the decline in oil prices, and the appreciation of the U.S. dollar."
" Overall, thirdquarter earnings estimates continued to imply modest growth in earnings per share compared with the previous quarter."
" Commercial and industrial loans on banks’ books continued to expand at a robust pace in the third quarter, consistent with the strong demand from large and     middlemarket firms reported in the October Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS)."
" According to the October SLOOS, banks eased CRE lending standards, on net, and reported stronger demand for such loans."
" Growth of CRE loans on the balance sheets of large Minutes of the Meeting of October 28–29, 2014Page 5_____________________________________________________________________________________________banks slowed in the third quarter, while growth at small banks remained moderate."
" Auto loans continued to be widely available, and respondents to the October SLOOS indicated that demand for auto loans had strengthened further in the third quarter."
" In addition, demand for credit card loans increased, and a few large banks reported having  eased lending policies on such loans."
"As in the United States, participants in foreign financial markets became more concerned, on balance, about  prospects for global economic growth."
" Expected policy rate paths moved down in most advanced economies, and marketbased measures of inflation compensation continued to decline."
 The Riksbank unexpectedly cut its main policy rate to zero in response to the low level of Swedish inflation.
"Staff Economic Outlook  The information on economic activity received since the staff prepared its forecast for the September FOMC meeting was close to expectations, and therefore, the staff’s projection for real GDP growth over the remainder of the year was little revised."
" However, in response to a further rise in the foreign exchange value of the dollar, a deterioration in global growth prospects, and a decline in equity prices, the staff revised down its projection for real GDP growth a little over the medium term."
" Even with the slower expansion of economic activity in this projection, real GDP was still expected to rise faster than potential output in 2015 and 2016, supported by accommodative monetary policy and a further easing of the restraint on spending from  changes in fi scal policy; in 2017, real GDP growth was projected to step down toward the rate of potential output growth."
" As a result, resource slack was anticipated to decline steadily, albeit at a slightly slower rate than in the previous projection, and the unemployment rate was expected to gradually improve and to be at the staff’s estimate of its longerrun natural rate in 2017."
"The staff’s forecast for inflation this quarter and early next year was reduced in response to further declines in crude oil prices, but the forecast for inflation over the medium term was only a touch lower."
 Consumer price inflation was projected to be lower in the second half of this year than in the first half and to remain below the Committee’s longerrun objective of 2 percent over the next few years.
" With resource slack projected to diminish slowly and changes in commodity and import prices anticipated to be subdued, inflation was projected to rise gradually and to reach the Committee’s objective in the longer run."
"The staff continued to view the uncertainty around its projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as similar to the average over the past 20 years."
" The risks to the forecast for real GDP growth Page 6Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________and inflation were seen as tilted to the downside, reflecting recent financial developments and concerns about the foreign economic outlook, as well as the staff’s assessment that neither monetary policy nor fiscal policy appeared well positioned to help the economy withstand adverse shocks."
" At the same time, the staff continued to view the risks around its outlook for the unemployment rate as roughly balanced."
"Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, most meeting participants viewed the information received over the intermeeting period as suggesting that economic activity continued to expand at a moderate pace."
" Labor market conditions improved somewhat further, with solid jo b gains and a lower unemployment rate; on balance, participants judged that the underutilization of labor resour ces was gradually diminishing."
" Participants generally expected that, over the medium term, real economic activity would increase at a pace sufficient to lead to a further gradual decline in the unemployment rate toward levels consistent with the Committee’s objective of maximum employment."
 Inflation was continuing to run below the Committee’s longerrun objective.
" Marketbased measures of inflation compensation declined somewhat, while surveybased measures of longerterm inflation expectations remained stable."
" Participants anticipated that inflation would be held down over the near term by the decline in energy prices and other factors, but would move toward the Committee’s 2 percent goal in coming years, although a few expressed concern that inflation might persist below the Committee’s objective for quite some time."
 Most viewed the risks to the outlook for economic activity and the labor market as nearly balanced.
" However, a number of participants noted that economic growth over the medium term might be slower than they currently expected if the foreign economic or financial situation deteriorated significantly."
" Among the other favorable factors that were expected to support continued growth in consumer spending, partic ipants cited solid gains in payroll employment, low interest rates, rising consumer confidence, and the decline in levels of household debt relative to income."
  The recovery in the housing sector remained slow despite low interest rates and some recent improvement in the availability of mortgage credit.
" A few participants pointed to continued strong growth in multifamily construction, although the limited pipeline of new projects in one District suggested that activity could slow in 2015."
" Contacts in several regions reported ready availability of credit, strong loan growth, or a steady increase in commercial construction activity ."
" It was observed that if foreign economic or financial conditions deteriorated further, U.S. economic growth over the medium term might be slower than currently expected."
" These participants suggested variously that the share of external trade in the U.S. economy is relatively small, that the effects of changes in the value of the dollar on net exports are modest, that shifts in the structure of U.S. trade and production over time may have reduced the effects on U.S. trade of developments like those seen of late, or that the slowdown in external demand would likely prove to be less severe Minutes of the Meeting of October 28–29, 2014Page 7_____________________________________________________________________________________________than initially feared."
" Several participants judged that the decline in the prices of energy and other commodities as well as lower longterm interest rates would likely provide an offset to the higher dollar and weaker foreign growth, or that the domestic recovery remained on a firm footing."
"Indicators of labor market conditions continued to improve over the intermeeting period, with a further reduction in the unemployment rate, declines in longerduration unemployment, strong growth in payroll employment, and a low level of initial claims for unemployment insurance."
" Business contacts reported employment gains in several parts of the country, with relatively few pointing to emerging wage pressures, although one participant indicated that larg er wage gains had been accruing to some individuals who switched jobs."
 A couple of participants judged that the large number of individuals working part time for economic reasons and the continued drift down in the labor force participation rate suggested that the unemployment rate was understating the degree of labor market underutilization.
"Most participants anticipated that inflation was likely to edge lower in the near term, reflecting the decline in oil and other commodity prices and lower import prices."
" These participants continued to expect inflation to move back to the Committee’s 2 percent target over the medium term as resource slack diminished in an environment of wellanchored inflation expectations, although a few of them thought the return to 2 percent might be quite gradual."
" Surveybased measures of inflation expectations remained well anchored, but marketbased measures of inflation compensation over the next five years as well as over the fiveyear period beginning five years ahead had declined over the intermeeting period."
" The explanations incl uded a decline in inflation risk premiums, possibly reflecting a lower perceived probability of higher inflatio n outcomes; and special factors, including liquidity risk premiums, that might be influencing the pricing of Treasury InflationProtected Securities and inflation derivatives."
" One participant noted that even if the declines re flected lower inflation risk premiums and not a reduction in expected inflation, policymakers might still want to take them into account because such a change could reflect increased concerns on the part of investors about adverse outcomes in which low inflation was accompanied by weak economic activity."
"However, many participants observed that the Committee should remain attentive to evidence of a possible downward shift in longerterm inflation expectations; some of them noted that if such an outcome occurred, it would be even more worrisome if growth faltered."
"In their discussion of financial market developments and financial stability issues, pa rticipants judged that the movements in the prices of stocks, bonds, commodities, and the U.S. dollar over the intermeeting period appeared to have been driven primarily by concerns about prospects for foreign economic growth."
"  In addition, a couple of participants noted the potent ial usefulness of collecting additional data on wholesale funding markets in order to better understand how changes in interest rates could influence those markets."
" A couple of others thought that the current forward guidance might be read as suggesting an earlier date of liftoff than was likely to prove appropriate, given the outlook for inflation and the downside risks to the economy associated with the effective lower bound on interest rates."
 Most participants supported retaining the language in the statement indicating that the Committee anticipates that economic conditions may warrant keeping the target range for the federal funds rate below longerrun normal levels even after employment and inflation are near mandateconsistent levels.
" However, a couple of  participants thought that the language should be amended in light of the prescriptions suggested by many monetary policy rules and the risks associated with keeping interest rates below their longerrun values for an extended period of time."
"Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that information received since the FOMC met in September indicated that economic activity was expanding at a moderate pace."
" Labor market conditions had improved somewhat further, with solid job gains and a lower unemployment rate; on balance, a range of indicators suggested that underutilization of labor resources was gradually diminishing."
 Inflation had continued to run below the Committee’s longerrun objective.
" Marketbased measures of inflation compensation had declined somewhat, but surveybased measures of longerterm inflation expectations had remained stable."
" The Committee expected that , with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity would expand at a moderate pace, with labor ma rket indicators and inflation moving toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate."
" On the one hand, including a reference would show that the Committee was monitoring financial developments while also providing an opportunity to note that financial conditions remained highly supportive of growth."
" On the other hand, including a reference risked the possibility of suggesting greater concern on the part of the Committee than was actually the case, perhaps leading to the misimpression that monetary policy was likely to respond to increases in volatility."
"In their discussion of the asset purchase program, members generally agreed that the condition articulated by the Committee when it began the program in September 2012 had been achieved—that is, there had been a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market—and that there was sufficient underlying strength in the broader economy to support ongoing progress toward maximum employment in a context of price stability."
"In addition, the Committee agreed to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and to reaffirm the indication in the statement that the Committee’s decision about how long to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate would depend on its assessment of actual and expected progress toward its Minutes of the Meeting of October 28–29, 2014Page 9_____________________________________________________________________________________________objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation."
" All but one member agreed that the Committee should reiterate the expectation that it likely would be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time following the end of the asset purchase program in October, especially if projected inflation continued to run below the Committee’s 2 percent longerrun goal, and provided that longerterm inflation expectations remained well anchored."
 The one member thought that the Committee should instead strengthen the forward guidance in order to underscore the Committee’s commitment to its 2 percent inflation objective.
" In particular, the statement would say that, if incoming information indicated faster progress toward the Committee’s employment and inflation objectives than the Committee now expects, then increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would likely occur sooner than currently anticipated."
" The Committee also agreed to reiterate its expectation that, even after employment and inflation are near mandateconsistent levels, economic conditions may, for some ti me, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run."
" At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct  the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: “Consistent with its st atutory mandate, the Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster maximum employment and price stability."
 The System Open Market Account manager and the secretary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the System’s balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the Committee’s objectives of maximum employment and price stability.” The vote encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p.m.: “Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in September suggests that economic activity is expanding at a moderate pace.
" Labor market conditions improved somewhat further, with solid job gains and a lower unemployment rate."
 Inflation has continued to run below the Committee’s longerrun objective.
 Marketbased measures of inflation compensation have declined somewhat; surveybased measures of longerterm inflation expectations have remained stable.
"Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
" The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, with labor market indicators and inflation moving toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate."
 The Committee sees the risks to the outlook for economic activity and the labor market as nearly balanced.
" Although inflation in the near term will likely be held down by lower energy prices and other factors, the Committee judges that the likelihood of Page 10Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________inflation running persis tently below 2 percent has diminished somewhat since early this year."
" Moreover, the Committee continues to see sufficient underlying strength in the broader economy to support ongoing progress toward maximum employment in a context of price stability."
"To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee today reaffirmed its view that the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate remains appropriate."
" In determining how long to maintain this target range, the Committee will assess progress—both realized and expected—toward its objectives of maximum employment and         2 percent inflation."
" This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments."
" The Committee anticipates, based on its current assessment, that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time following the end of its asset purchase program this month, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee’s          2 percent longerrun goal, and provided that longerterm inflation expectations remain well anchored."
" However, if incoming information indicates faster progress toward the Committee’s employment and inflation objectives than the Committee now expects, then increases in the target range for the federal funds rate are likely to occur sooner than currently anticipated."
"When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longerrun goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent."
" The Committee currently anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near mandateconsistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run.” Voting for this action:   Janet L."
"Mr. Kocherlakota dissented because he believed that, in light of continued sluggishness in the inflation outlook and the recent slide in market -based measures of longerterm inflation expectations, the Committee should commit to maintaining the current target range for the federal funds rate at least until projected inflation one to two years ahead has returned to 2 percent and should continue the asset purchase program at its current pace."
" Mr. Kocherlakota noted that when the Committee first reduced its asset purchases in  December 2013, it said in the postmeeting statement that it would be monitoring inflation developments carefu lly for evidence that inflation was moving back toward its objective over the medium term; Mr. Kocherlakota indicated he saw no such evidence."
"LongerRun Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy In the discussion at the January 2014 FOMC meeting regarding the annual reaffirmation of the Statement on LongerRun Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, participants noted that, while they were generally satisfied with the statement, it would be appropriate to consider whether any changes might be warranted before the statement was reaffirmed in 2015."
"  Minutes of the Meeting of October 28–29, 2014Page 11_____________________________________________________________________________________________At this meeting, a staff presentation discussed three issues related to the existing statement that might warrant elaboration or clarification:  whether inflation persistently below the Committee’s 2 percent longerrun objective and inflation similarl y persistently above that objective would be regarded as equally undesirable, whether additional information should be provided about the “balanced approach” that the Committee takes in promoting its two objectives under circumstances in which these objectives are judged not to be complementary, and how financ ial stability is linked to the Committee’s mandated goals of maximum employment and price stability."
" Following the staff presentation, participants discussed a range of topics related to these three issues and to monetary policy communications more broadly."
" On the specific issues, ther e was widespread agreement that inflation moderately above the Committee’s 2 percent goal and inflation the same amount below that level were equally costly—and many  participants thought that that view was largely shared by the public."
 One participant suggested that the Committee should clarify the time horizon within which it seeks to achieve its inflation objective.
" A few of them offered suggestions for communicating more specifically how financial stab ility, and perhaps other asymmetric risks to the outlook, are taken into account in the setting of monetary policy."
" However, several other participants noted that reaching an agreement in the near term on clarifying the linkages between monetary policy and financial stability could prove challenging, in part because the issues involved are complex and need further study."
