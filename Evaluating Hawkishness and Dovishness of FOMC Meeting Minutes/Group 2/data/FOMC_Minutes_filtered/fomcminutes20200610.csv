"These foundational principles guide us in all we do, from monetary policy to our focus on diversity and inclusion in our workplace, and to our work regulating and supervising banks to ensure fair access to credit around the country."
"Discussion of Forward Guidance, Asset Purchases, and Yield Curve Caps or Targets  Participants discussed tools for conducting monetary policy when the federal funds r ate is at its effective lower bound (ELB)."
" The discussion addressed two topics: (1) the roles of forward guidance and largescale asset purchase programs in supporting the attainment of the Committee’s maximumemplo yment and pricestability goals and (2) in light of the foreign and historical experience with approaches that cap or target interest rates along the yield curve, whether such approaches could be used to support forward guidance and complement asset purchase programs."
" The staff briefing on the first topic focused on outcomebased forward guidance for the federal funds rate—which ties changes in the target range for the federal funds rate to the achievement of specified macroeconomic outcomes, such as reaching a given level of the unemployment rate or inflation—and asset purchase programs of the kind used during and following the previous recession."
 The staff presented results from model simulations that suggested that forward guidance and largescale asset purchases can help support the labor market recovery and the return of inflation to the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent inflation goal.
" But the staff also highlighted the potential for YCT policies to require the central bank to  purchase very sizable Minutes of the Meeting of June 9–10, 2020Page 3_____________________________________________________________________________________________  amounts of government debt under certain circumstances—a potential that was realized in the U.S. experience in the 1940s—and the po ssibility that, under YCT policies, monetary policy goals might come in conflict with public debt management goals, which could pose risks to the independence of the central bank."
"  In their discussion of forward guidance and largescale asset purchases, participants agreed that the Committee has had extensive experience with these tools, that they were effective in the wake of the previous recession, that they have become key parts of the monetary policy toolkit, and that, as a result, they have important roles to play in supporting the attainment of the Committee’s maximumemployment and pricestability goals."
 Various participants noted that the economy is likely to need support from highly accommodative monetary policy for some time and that it will be important in coming months for the Committee to provide greater clarity regarding the likely path of the federal funds rate and asset purchases.
 A number of participants spoke favorably of forward guidance tied to inflation outcomes that could possibly entail a modest temporary overshooting of the Committee’s longerrun inflation goal but where inflation fluctuations would be centered on 2 percent over time.
 They saw this form of forward guidance as helping re inforce the credibility of the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent inflation objective and potentially preventing a premature withdrawal of monetary policy accommodation.
" A couple of participants signaled a preference for forward guidance tied to the unemployment rate, noting that it would be more credible to focus on labor market outcomes that have been achieved in the recent past or that—given how high the unemployment rate currently is—such guidance would clearly signal a high degree of accommodation for an extended period."
" Regardless of the specific form of forward guidance, a couple of participants expressed the concern that policies that effectively committed the Committee to maintaining very low interest rates for a long time could ultimately pose significant risks to financial stability."
" A number of participants commented on additional challenges associated with YCT policies focused on the longer portion of the yield curve, including how these policies might interact with largescale asset purchase Page 4Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________  programs and the extent of additional accommodation they would provide in the current environment of very low interest rates."
 Some of these participants also noted that longerterm yields are importantly influenced by factors such as longerrun inflation expectations and the longerrun neutral real interest rate and that changes in these factors or difficulties in estimating them could result in the central bank inadve rtently setting yield caps or targets at inappropriate levels.
"A number of participants emphasized that, when assessing the potential roles that different monetary policy tools might play to support the attainment of the Committee’s goals, it was important to think about how various policy tools could be used in coordination as part of the Committee’s overall strategy to achieve its dualmandate objectives."
" In addition, various participants noted that clear communications with the public are central to the efficacy of all policy tools and that, therefore, the Committee should complete its monetary policy framework review in the near term, including revising the Statement on LongerRun Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy."
 Risk asset prices were buoyed by optimism about the potential for increased economic activity associated with reopenings as parts of the United States and other countries rela xed lockdown restrictions.
" Despite this impr ovement in risk sentiment, market participants expected  weak overall growth in 2020, and elevated uncertain ties in the outlook remained."
"Regarding expectations for monetary policy, respondents to the Open Market Trading Desk’s surveys suggested that most market participants did not anticipate policy changes at the June meeting."
Staff Review of the Economic Situation The coronavirus outbreak and the measures undertaken to contain its spread were severely disrupting economic activity in the United States and abroad.
" Consumer price inflation, as measured by the 12month percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), slowed notably through April, reflecting the effects of both weak aggregate demand and low energy prices."
"Total nonfarm payroll employment expanded strongly in May, though by much less than the historic job losses recorded in April."
 The unemployment rate moved down to 13.3 percent in May after soaring to 14.7 percent in April.
" As was highlighted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, these figures likely understated the extent of unemployment; accounting for the unusually large number of workers who reported themselves as employed but absent from their jobs would have raised the unemployment rate by 5 percentage points in April and 3 percentage points in May."
 Both the labor force participation rate and the employmentto-population ratio increased in May.
" Initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits had declined through the last week of May from their peak in late March, but they still were at a historically elevated level."
" Average hourly earnings for all employees declined in May after rising sharply in April, but these fluctuations largely reflected the substantial changes in the level and co mposition of employment, which disproportionately affected lowerwage workers."
 The employment cost index for total labor compensation in the private sector increased 2.8 percent over the 12 months ending in March—a period mostly predating the onset of the pandemic—and was the same as its yearearlier pace.
"Total PCE price inflation was only 0.5 percent over the 12 months ending in April, reflecting both weak aggregate demand in recent months and a considerable drop in consumer energy prices."
" Core PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in consumer food and energy prices, was 1.0 percent over the 12 months ending in April."
" In contrast, the trimmed mean measure of 12month PCE price inflation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas was 1.9 percent in April."
" The consumer price index (CPI) inched up 0.1 percent over the 12 months ending in May, while core CPI inflation was 1.2 percent over the same period."
 Recent readings on surveybased measures of longerrun inflation expectations were little changed on balance.
 The 10year measure for PCE price inflation from the Survey of Professional Forecasters ticked down in the second quarter.
 All of  these measures of longerrun inflation expectations continued to be near their recent ranges.
" The nominal U.S. international trade deficit widened in both March and April, as exports of goods and services plunged more than imports."
"  Foreign economic activity cont racted in the first quarter, even though most countries abroad introduced strict  socialdistancing measures to contain the spread of the coronavirus only toward th e end of the quarter."
" In China, where restrictions were largely lifted by the end of the first quarter, data pointed to a relatively quick rebound in economic activity in the second quarter."
" Outside of China, indicators suggested that foreign economic activity plummeted further in the second quarter, notwithstanding some signs of improvement in May as restrictions started to ease."
 Inflation rates fell sharply across most foreign economie s in April and May.
 The low level of oil prices relative to a year ago contributed to 12month inflation rates close to or below zero in many advanced foreign economies (AFEs).
"  Staff Review of the Financial Situation Over the intermeeting period, risk sentiment improved, on net, as optimism over reopening the economy, potential coronavirus treatments, the unexpectedly positive May employment situation report, and other indicators that suggest that economic activity may be rebounding more than offset concerns arising from otherwise dire economic data releases, warnings from health experts that openings may have been premature, and renewed tensions between the United States and China."
 This view was supported by Federal Reserve communications that negative interest rates did not appear to be an attractive policy tool.
" Longerterm yields were likely Minutes of the Meeting of June 9–10, 2020Page 7_____________________________________________________________________________________________  boosted by expectations of heavy upcoming Treasury security issuance as well as so me unwinding of safehaven demands in connection with improved investor sentiment."
 The Treasury’s first 20year bond offering since 1986 was met with solid demand .
" Changes in inflation compensation based on Treasury InflationProtected Securities yields were mixed; 5year inflation compensation rose amid the recent partial rebound in crude oil prices, while the 5to-10year measure edged down."
 Heavy demand for Treasury bills from money market funds held down rates despite an unprecedented pace of issuance.
" Further monetary policy and fiscal policy support in foreign countries, the easing of coronavirusrelated restri ctions, and a strongerthan-expected U.S. May employment report outweighed concerns about otherwise weak global economic data and the resurgence of U.S.–China tensions."
" The euro appreciated notably over the period, lifted in part by the European fiscal and monetary policy communications."
The sharp decline in economic activity had also curtailed the demand for consumer credit.
" U.S. real GDP was forecast to show a historically large decline in the second quarter of this year, and the unemployment rate was expected to be sharply higher than in the first quarter."
" The substantial fiscal policy measures and appreciable support from monetary policy, along with the Federal Reserve’s liquidity and lending facilities, were expected to help mitigate the deterioration in current economic conditions and to help boost the recovery."
" Under the staff’s baseline assumptions that the current restrictions on social interactions and business operations would continue to ease gradually this year, real GDP was forecast to rise appreciably and the unemployment rate to decline considerably in the second half of the year, although a complete recovery was not expected by yearend."
" Inflation was projected to weaken this year, reflecting both the deterioration in resource utilization and sizable expected declines in consumer energy prices."
" Under the baseline assumptions, economic conditions were projected to continue to improve, and inflation to pick back up, over the next two years."
" In this scenario, a second wave of the coronavirus outbreak, with another round of strict limitations on social interactions and business operations, was a ssumed to begin later this Minutes of the Meeting of June 9–10, 2020Page 9_____________________________________________________________________________________________  year, leading to a decrease in real GDP, a jump in the unemployment rate, and re newed downward pressure on inflation next year."
" Compared with the baseline, the disruption to economic activity was more severe and protracted in this scenario, with real GDP and inflation lower and the unemployment rate higher by the end of the mediumterm projection."
"Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2020 through 2022 and over the longer run, based on their individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy—including the path for the federal funds rate."
" The longerrun projections represented each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the econo my."
 The virus and the measures taken to protect public health induced sharp declines in economic activity and a surge in job losses.
 Weaker demand and significantly lower oil prices were holding down consumer price inflation.
 The fiscal response to economic developments had been large and timely and was providing much needed support for economic activity.
 Credit flows and economic activity were also being supported by the lending facilities established under the authority of section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury.
"Participants judged that the effects of the coronavirus outbreak and the ongoing public health crisis will weigh heavily on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term and would pose considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term."
 Participants agreed that the data for the second quarter would likely show the largest decline in economic activity in post–World War II history.
" With supportive monetary policy and payments to households under the CARES Act (Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act), including enhanced unemployment insurance payments, participants expected personal consumption expenditures to grow strongly in the second half of the year, albeit from very low levels."
" However, the recovery in c onsumer spending was not expected to be particularly rapid beyond this year, with voluntary social distancing, precautionary saving, and lower levels of employment and income restraining the pace of expansion over the medium term."
" Some business contacts pointed to halting improvements in consumer demand, a dearth in public infrastructure projects due to strained state and local government budget conditions, or the decline in  energy prices as factors likely to depress business spen ding."
" Some participants also noted reports of firms stating that they have had some challenges in rehiring employees, in part related to temporary enhanced unemployment insurance benefits."
" Participants generally agreed that practices and developments in public health to address the pandemic would be critical for ensuring a strong and lasting reopening of businesses and reducing the likelihood of an outsized wave of closures, but monetary policy and, especially, Page 10Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________  fiscal policy would play important roles."
" Participants noted that because of misclassification errors in the Current Population Survey, the official unemployment rate for May likely understated the extent of unemployment; others observed that government reliance on unemployment insurance as a vehicle for income support under the CARES Act complicates the interpretation of the data."
" Participants also noted that unemployment insurance claims continued to run at a historically elevated level, but the proportion of laidoff workers who expected to be recalled was unusually large."
 Participants also regarded highly accommodative monetary policy and sustained support from fiscal policy as likely to be needed to facilitate a durable recovery in labor market conditions.
" Overall, participants expected that a full recovery in employment would take some time."
"With regard to inflation, participants reiterated their view that the negative effect from the pandemic on aggregate demand was likely to more than offset any upward pressure from supply constraints so that the overall effect of the outbreak on prices was seen as disinflationary."
" Consistent with that interpretation, participants observed the recent negative readings on the monthly CPI and noted that they anticipated that the 12month PCE inflation measure would likely run well below the Committee’s 2 percent objective for some time."
" Observing that inflation had been running somewhat below the Committee’s 2 percent longerrun objective before the coronavirus outbreak, some participants noted a risk that longterm inflation expect ations might deteriorate."
 Participants noted that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy would likely be needed for some time to achieve the 2 percent in flation objective over the longer run.
" Participants shared views on possible outcomes for the reopening of the economy, the prospects for effective voluntary social distancing, and the efficacy of public health initiatives for their implications for economic activity and employment."
" A number of participants judged that there was a substantial likelihood of additional waves of outbreaks, which, in some scenarios, could re sult in further economic disruptions and possibly a protracted period of reduced economic activity."
" Other possibilities included economic activity that might recover more quickly if sizable, widespread outbreaks could be avoided even as households and businesses relax or modify socialdistancing behaviors."
"Minutes of the Meeting of June 9–10, 2020Page 11_____________________________________________________________________________________________  As part of their discussions of longerrun risks, participants noted that in some adve rse scenarios, more business closures would occur, and workers would experience longer spells of unemployment that could lead to a loss of skills that could impair their employment prospects."
" In addition, to the extent that transmissionmitigation procedures adopted by firms reduced their productivity, or if the reallocation of industry output resulted in a lasting reductio n in business investment, the longerrun level of potential output could be reduced."
" In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, participants reaffirmed that the Federal Reserve was committed to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challe nging time, thereby promoting its maximumemployment an d pricestability goals."
" In light of their assessment that the ongoing public health crisis would weigh heavily on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term and posed considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term, all participants judged that it would be appropriate to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent."
 Keeping the target range at the ELB would continue to provide support to the economy and promote the Committee’s maximumemployment and pricestability goals.
"Participants also agreed that, to support the flow of credit to households and businesses, over coming months it would be appropriate for the Federal Reserve to increase its holdings of Treasury securities and agency MBS and agency CMBS at least at the current pace to sustain smooth market functioning, thereby fostering effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions."
"Participants agreed that the current stance of monetary policy remained appropriate, but many noted that the Committee could, at upcoming meetings, further clarify its intentions with respect to its future monetary policy decisions as the economic outlook becomes clearer."
 A number of participants judged that it was important for forward guidance and asset purchases to be structured in a way that provides the accommodation necessary to support rapid economic recovery and fosters a durable return of inflation and inflation expectations to levels consistent with the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective.
" Many participants remarked that the completion of the monetary policy framework review, together with the announcement of the conclusions arising from the review and the release of a revised Committee statement on its goals and policy strategy, would help clarify further how the Committee intends to conduct monetary policy going forward."
"  Committee Policy Action  In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that the coronavirus outbreak was causing tremendous human and economic hardship across the United States and around the world."
 The virus and the measures taken to protect public health had induced sharp declines in economic activity and a surge in job Page 12Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________  losses.
 Consumer price inflation was being held down by weaker demand and significantly lower oil prices.
" Members agreed that the Federal Reserve was committed to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximumemployment and pr icestability goals."
" Members further concurred that the ongoing public health crisis would weigh heavily on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term and posed considerable downside risks to the economic outlook over the medium term."
 Members noted that they expected to maintain this target range until they were confident that the ec onomy had weathered recent events and was on track to achieve the Committee’s maximumemployment and pr icestability goals.
" Members agreed that they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook, including information related to public health, as well as global developments and muted inflation pressures, and would us e the Committee’s tools and act as appropriate to support the economy."
" In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the stance of monetary policy, members noted that they would assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to the Committee’s maximumemployment objective and its symmetric 2 pe rcent inflation objective."
" This assessment would take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
" To support the flow of credit to households and businesses, members agreed that over coming months it would be appropriate for the Federal Reserve to increase its holdings of Treasury se curities and agency MBS and agency CMBS at least at the current pace to sustain smooth market functioning, thereby fostering effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions."
" Increase the System Open Market Account holdings of Treasury securities, agency mortgagebacked securities (MBS), and agency commercial mortgagebacked securities (CMBS) at least at the current pace to sustain smooth functi oning of markets for these securities, thereby fostering effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions."
" Engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary  to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve’s agency MBS transactions.” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2:00 p.m.: “The Federal Reserve is committed to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time , thereby promoting its maximum employment and price stability goals."
 The virus and the measures taken to protect public health have induced sharp declines in economic activity and a surge in job losses.
 Weaker demand and significantly lower oil prices are holding down consumer price inflation.
"The ongoing public health crisis will weigh heavily on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term, and poses considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term."
 The Committee expects to maintain this target range until it is confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals.
"The Committee will contin ue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook, including information related to public health, as well as global developments and muted inflation pressures, and will use its tools and act as appropriate to support the economy."
" In determining the timing and size of future adjustment s to the stance of monetary policy, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective."
" This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
"To support the flow of credit to households and businesses, over  coming  months  the  Federal Reserve will increase its holdings of Treasury securities and agency residential and commercial mortgagebacked securities at least at the current pace to sustain smooth market functioning, thereby fostering effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions."
"Consistent with the Committee’s decision to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the Board of Governors voted unanimously to leave the interest rates on required and excess reserve balances at 0.10 percent."
"Clouse Secretary Page 14Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ Summary of Economic Projections In conjunction with the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting held on June 9–10, 2020, meeting participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real gross domestic product (GDP) growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2020 to 2022 and over the longer run."
" Each participant’s projections were based on information available at the time of the meeting, together with his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy—including a path for the federal funds rate and its longerrun value—and assumptions about other factors likely to affect economic outcomes."
" The longerrun projections represent each participant’s assessment of the value to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy.1  “Appropriate monetary policy” is defined as the future path of policy that each participant deems most likely to foster outcomes for economic activity and inflation that best satisfy his or her individual interpretation of the statutory mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability."
"The current projections for re al activity, the labor market, and inflation were substantially weaker than the projections in the December 2019 Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) because participants revised their economic outlook in light of the effects of the coronavirus (COVID19) pandemic and the measures taken to contain it.2  Table 1 and figure 1 provide summary statistics for the projections; participants’ projections in the current SEP reflected their assumptions about the course of the pandemic and actions to control its spread."
 All participants projected that real GDP will contract sharply in 2020 and that the unemployment rate in the final quarter of the year would be markedly higher than they had projected in December.
 Almost all participants projected that real GDP would grow faster than their estimates of its longerrun normal growth rate in 2021 and 2022 and that the unemployment rate would decline.
" Participants expected that a full economic recovery would take some time, with almost all participants projecting that the unemployment rate in the final quarter of 2022 would still be above their estimates of it s level in the longer run."
"1 One participant did not submit longerrun projections for real GDP growth, the unemployme nt rate, or the federal funds rate."
"Similarly, almost all particip ants projected that total inflation, as measured by the fourquarter percent change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), would be below the FOMC’s 2 percent inflation objective throughout the forecast period."
" Projections for core PCE inflation, which excludes food and energy, generally followed a tr ajectory similar to the projections for total inflation."
"  As shown in figure 2, almost all participants indicated that their expectations rega rding the evolution of the economy, relative to the Committee’s objectives of maximum employment and 2 perc ent inflation, would likely warrant keeping the federal fu nds rate at its current level through at least the end of 2022."
" In addition, a substantial majority of participants assessed the risks to their outlook for real GDP growth as weighted to the downside and the risks to their unemployment rate projections as weighted to the upside."
 The risks to inflation projections were judged as weighted to the downside by a substantial majority of participants; no participant assessed the risks to his or her inflation outlook as weighted to the upside.
"The Outlook for Real GDP Growth and the Unemployment Rate  As illustrated in figure 3.A, which shows the distributions of participants’ projections for real GDP growth from 2020 to 2022 and in the long er run, all participants projected that real GDP will  decline in 2020, a development that reflects the coronavirus outbreak and the measures undertaken to contain its spread."

" Almost all participants expected that the rate of real GDP growth in 2021 and 2022 would be above their estimates of its longerrun pace, with the median projections being 5.0 percent and 3.5 percent, respectively."
" The distribution of estimates of real GDP growth in the longer run was little changed from the December SEP, although the median projection ticked down to 1.8 percent."
"  The distributions of participants’ projections for the unemployment rate from 2020 to 2022 and in the longer run are shown in figure 3.B.  Reflecting the effects of the pandemic, the projections for the unemployment rate were revised up considerably throughout the forecast period relative to the December SEP."
" The projections for the unemployment rate in the final quarter of this year ranged from 7.0 to 14.0 percent, with a median of 9.3 percent."
" For the final quarter of 2021, the projections for the unemployment rate ranged from 4.5 to 12.0 percent, with the median  being 6.5 percent."
" The width of the ranges of the forecasts for the unemployment rate in the final quarters of this year and next year were 7.0 percentage points and 7.5 percentage points, respectively—more than three times the widest ranges for forecasts of similar horizons  that were submitted from 2007 to 2009."
" The median projection for the unemployment rate in th e final quarter of 2022, at 5.5 percent, was above the median estimate of the longerrun normal rate of unemployment of 4.1 percent."
" Indeed, almost all particip ants who submitted longerrun projections expected that the unemployment rate in the final quarter of 2022 would still be above their estimates of the longerrun value."
 The distribution of estimates for the longerrun unemployment rate was little changed from the December SEP.
 The Outlook for Inflation Figures 3.C and 3.D show the distributions of participants’ projections for total and core PCE inflation from 2020 to 2022 and in the longer run.
 All participants revised down their projections for inflation in 2020 relative to their December projections.
±1.3 ±1.8 ±2.0 Unemployment rate1 .
±0.7 ±1.0 ±1.0 Shortterm interest rates3 .
" As described in the box “Forecast Unce rtainty,” under certain assumptions, there is about a 70 percent probabilit y that actual outcomes for real GDP, unemployment, consumer prices, and the federal funds rate will be in ranges implied by the average size of projection errors made in the past."
" 0.7 and 1.3 percent, with me dian expectations for total and core inflation of 0.8 percent and 1.0 percent, respectively."
" In the December SEP, participants had expected that total inflation would be between 1.7 and 2.3 percent in 2020."
" In the current SEP, almost all participants expected the inflation rate to rise over the next two years."
" However, the vast majority of participants expected PCE price inflation in 2022 to  fall short of the Committee’s 2 percent inflation objective, with the median projection for total PCE price inflation being 1.7 percent."
"  Appropriate Monetary Policy The distributions of participants’ judgments regarding the appropriate target—or midpoint of the target range—for the federal funds rate at the end of each year from 2020 to 2022 and over the longer run are shown in figure 3.E.  With substantial agreement that the unemployment rate would remain above its longerrun level throughout the forecast period and that inflation would run below the Committee’s objective of 2 percent, almost all participants projected that it would be appropriate to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent through at least the end of 2022."

" Participants’ assessments of the level of uncertainty surrounding their individual economic projections relative to the average level of uncertainty over the past 20 years are shown in the panels on the left side of figure 4.3  All participants viewed the curr ent uncertainty surrounding each of the four economic variables—real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, total PCE inflation, and core PCE inflation—as being greater than the average over the past 20 years, which is the first time this situation has occurred since th e introduction of the SEP in 2007.4 Participants’ assessments of the balance of risks to their current economic projections are shown in the panels on the right side of figure 4."
 A substantial majority of participants judged the risks to their projections for real GDP growth as weighted to the downside and the risks to their unemployment rate projections as weighted to the upside.
 A substantial majo rity of participants viewed the risks to their inflation projections as weighted to the downside; no participant assessed the risks to his or her inflation outlook as weighted to the upside.
" The possibilities of second waves of contagion and delays in                                                            3 As a reference, table 2 provides estimates of the forecast uncertainty for the change in real GDP, the unemployment rate, and total consumer price inflat ion over the period from 2000 through 2019."
" Participants also mentioned a number of other unknowns and risk factors related to the outlook, including the extent of supplyside disruptions; possible changes in household behavior; the degree to which business bankruptcies might cause dislocations; the extent of fiscal policy support; and possibly depressed foreign demand given the global nature of the pandemic."
" Several participants also expressed concerns abou t longerrun issues in the event of a prolonged recession, such as labor market scarring if the unemployment rate remained elevated and inflation persistently undershooting the FOMC’s 2 percent inflation objective."
" Because the Committee adjusts monetary policy in response to actual and prospective developments over time in key economic variables—such as real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation—uncertainty surrounding the projected path for the federal funds rate importantly reflects the uncertainties about the paths for these economic variables, along with other factors."

" Thus, in setting the stance of monetary policy, participants consider not only what appears to be the most likely economic outcome as embodied in their projections, but also the range of alternative possibilities, the likelihood of their occurring, and the potential costs to the economy should they occur."
"Table 2 summarizes the average historical accuracy of a range of forecasts, including those reported in past Monetary Policy Report s and those prepared by the Federal Reserve Board’s staff in advance of meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)."
 The corresponding 70 percent confidence intervals for overa ll inflation would be 1.3 to 2.7 percent in the current year and 1.0 to 3.0 percent in the second and third years.
" As with real activity and inflation, the outlook for the future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerab le uncertainty."
 This uncertainty arises primarily becaus e each participant’s assessment of the appropriate stance of monetary policy depends importantly on the evolution of real activity and inflation over time.
" It should be noted, however, that these confidence intervals are not strictly consistent with the projections for the federal funds rate, as these projections are not forecasts of the most likely quarterly outcomes but rather are projections of participants’ individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy and are on an endof-year basis."
" However, the forecast errors should provide a sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy that would be appropriate to offset the effects of shocks to the economy."
