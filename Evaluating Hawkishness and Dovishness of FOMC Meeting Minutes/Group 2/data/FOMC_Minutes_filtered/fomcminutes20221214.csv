" Following several months of tightening, financial conditions eased over the period as investor concerns about global risks edged lower and incoming data showed nascent signs of a moderation in inflationary pressures."
" However, equity market contacts noted risks to growth  ahead , and earnings expectations for coming quarters had been marked down."
" In foreign exchange markets, moderating concerns about the potential for highly elevated U.S. interest rates spurred a depreciation in the foreign exchange value of the dollar."
"  Regarding the outlook for inflation in the United States, inflation compensation implied by Treasury I nflation Protected Securities declined over the period, responding to lower -thanexpected consumer price index ( CPI) data and a sizable drop in oil prices."
" However, the Desk survey -based measu res of inflation expectations were little changed from the prior survey, suggesting that falling inflation risk premiums may have contributed to the moves."
   Both market - and survey -based measures continued to point to expectations for a moderation of inflation over the coming year.
" Regarding the outlook for monetary policy, both market- and Desk survey -based measures indicated expectations for the Committee to maintain elevated policy rates through 2023."
" Repurchase agreement (r epo) rates firmed modestly relative to the overnight reverse re purchase agreement  (ON RRP ) facility rate over the period  with balance sheet reduction reportedly contributing , in part,  to an increase in the demand for financing of Treasury securities."
 Consumer price inflation— as measured by the  12month percent change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE)—stepped down in October but continued to be elevated.
 Total nonfarm payroll employment posted solid gains in October and November that were slower than the average monthly pace seen over the earlier part of the year.
 The unemployment rate moved up 0.2 percentage point to 3.7 percent in October and remained at that rate in November.
" On balance, the unemployment rate for African Americans edged down over those two months, while the unemployment rate for Hispanics increased slightly; the unemployment rates for both groups remained above the national measure."
 Both the labor force participation rate and the employmentto- population ratio declined a little over the past two months.
  Nominal wage growth continued to be elevated and remained above the pace judged to be consistent with the FOMC’s 2 percent inflation objective.
" Average hourly earnings rose 5.1 percent over the 12 months ending in November, close to the pace recorded in the employment cost index of hourly compensation in the private sector over the 12 months ending in September."
" Compensation per hour (CPH) in the business sector rose 4.0 percent over the four quarters ending in the third quarter, but the reported increase likely understated the true pace of increase in CPH, as the lower second -quarter employment data from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages had not yet been incorporated in the CPH measure."
  Consumer price inflation remained elevated but had eased in recent months.
" Total PCE price inflation was 6.0 percent over the 12 months ending in October, 0.3 percentage point below the September figure."

" A preliminary estimate of the staff’s common inflation expectations index, which combines information from many indicators of inflation expectations and inflation compensation, edged down in the fourth quarter but continued to be above prepandemic levels ."
"After expanding at a moderate pace in the third quarter, real PCE growth appeared to have picked up in the fourth quarter."
" In contrast, residential investment looked to be contracting sharply further, and growth in business fixed investment seemed to be slowing markedly, with tepid gains in equipment and intangibles spending and continued declines in nonresidential structures investment."
" After narrowing in the third quarter, the nominal U.S. international trade deficit widened in October."
" Foreign economic activity grew at a moderate pace in the third quarter, but more recent data pointed to weakening growth, weighed down by the economic fallout of Russia’s war against Ukraine and a COVID19-related slowdown in China."
" High inflation continued to contribute to a decline in real disposable incomes , which, together with disruptions to energy supplies, depressed economic activity, especially in Europe."
" In China, authorities began to ease social restrictions even as COVID cases surged, raising the prospect of significant disruptions to economic activity in the near term, but also a faster reopening."
 Weaker global demand and high interest rates also weighed on activity in emerging market economies.
" Despite tentative signs of easing in foreign headline inflation, core inflationary pressures remained elevated in Page 4Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________  many countries."
" In response to high inflation, many central banks further tightened monetary policy, albeit at a slower pace in some cases."
" Staff Review of the Financial Situation  Over the intermeeting period, Treasury yields and measures of inflation compensation declined, on net, and the implied path of the federal funds rate in 2023 ended modestly lower."
" Stock market indexes rose, on balance, likely reflecting reduced concerns about the inflation outlook, and market volatility declined n otably."
" The expected path of the federal funds rate implied by a straight read of financial market quotes  ended the intermeeting period lower, largely reflecting data releases that pointed to a larger -thanexpected moderation in inflation."
" Medium -tolonger -term nominal Treasury yields declined substantially over the intermeeting period, driven primarily by lower -thanexpected inflation data releases, which appeared to prompt a substantial reduction in investors’ concerns about the possibility that inflation would remain high for a long period."
" In line with those development s, inflation compensation measures based on inflation swaps declined notably, especially for shorter maturities."
" Broad stock price indexes increased, likely reflecting reduced concerns about the inflation outlook and the associated implications for the future path of policy."
" In line with reduced investor concerns about the inflation outlook, spreads of interest rates on corporate debt, mortgagebacked securities, and municipal bonds to comparable -duration Treasury yields all narrowed over the intermeeting period."
"  Foreign financial conditions broadly eased over the intermeeting period, largely driven by lower -thanexpected U.S. inflation  data."
 Optionimplied volatility measures for exchange rates and benchmark foreign yields declined but remained elevated by historical norms amid a high degree of uncertainty around global inflation and the prospects for  a reopening of the Chinese economy.
 Bank interest rates for commercial and industrial (C&I) loans continued to trend up in the third quarter.
" In contrast, interest rates in credit card offers continued to increase, reflecting the higher prime rate that was quickly passed through."
 Interest rates on auto loans also rose steadily through November.
" C&I loans continued to grow in October and November but decelerated relative to the thirdquarter pace, moderating the robust rate of growth observed earlier this year."
 The number of home purchases and refinance mortgage rate locks edged lower at subdued levels despite recent declines in mortgage interest rates.
 Staff Economic Outlook  The forecast for U.S. economic activity prepared by the staff for the December FOMC meeting was not as weak as the November projection.
" Recent data suggested that real GDP growth in the second half of 2022 was stronger than previously expected, but economic growth was still forecast to slow markedly in 2023 from its second-half pace ."
" Broad financial conditions were projected to be somewhat less restrictive than previously assumed, as the effect s of a higher path for equity values and a lower path for the dollar more than offset a higher mediumterm trajectory for interest rates."
" Nevertheless, the forecast for U.S. real GDP growth through 2025 remained subdued."
" Moreover, the staff assumed a slower pace of decline in the natural rate of unemployment over the near term in response to recent estimates suggesting that job -matching efficiency was not improving as fast as previously anticipated."
" Likewise, the unemployment rate was expected to move above the staff’s estimate of its natural rate near the end of 2024 and remain above it in 2025."
" On a four -quarter change basis, total PCE price inflation was expected to be 5.5 percent in 202 2, while core inflation was expected to be 4.7 percent, both lower than in the November projection."
" With the effects of supply–demand imbalances in goods markets expected to unwind further and labor and product markets projected to become less tight, the staff continued to forecast that inflation would decline markedly over the next two years ."
" Core goods inflation was anticipated to slow further, housing services inflation was expected to peak in 2023 and then move down, while  core nonhousing services Page 6Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________  inflation was forecast to move down as wage growth eased."
" I n 2025, both total and core PCE price inflation were expected to be near 2 percent."
" With inflation still elevated, the staff continued to view the risks to the inflation projection as skewed to the upside."
" Moreover, the sluggish growth in real private domestic spending expected over the next year, a subdued global economic outlook, and persistently tight financial conditions were seen as tilting the risks to the downside around the baseline projecti on for real economic activity, and the staff still viewed the possibility of a recession sometime over the next year as a plausible alternative to the baseline."
" Participants ’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook  In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2022 through 2025  and over the longer run, based on their individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy, including the path of the federal funds rate."
" The longer -run projections represented each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy."
" In their discussion of current ec onomic conditions, participants noted that recent indicators pointed to modest growth of spending and production."
" Nonetheless, job gains had been robust in recent months, and the unemployment rate had remained low."
" Inflation remained elevated, reflecting  supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher food and energy prices, and broader price pressures."
 The war and related events we re contributing to upward pressure on inflation and were weighing on global economic activity.
" Against this background, participants continued to be highly attentive to inflation risks."
" Participants observed that the growth of economic activity had slowed  significantly in 2022 from the previous year’s robust pace, partly in response to the Committee’s policy actions ."
" Participants remarked that, altho ugh real GDP appeared to have rebounded moderately in the second half of 2022 after declining somewhat in the first half, economic activity appeared likely to expand  in 2023 at a pace well below its trend growth rate."
" With inflation remaining unacceptably high, participants expect ed that a sustained period of below -trend real GDP growth would be needed to bring aggregate supply and aggregate demand into better balance and thereby reduce inflationary pressures."
" In their discussion of the household sector, participants noted that growth in consumer spending in September and October  had been stronger than they had previously expected, likely supported by a strong labor market and households running down excess savings accumulated during the pandemic."
 Participants commented that higher mortgage interest rates had notably restrained housing activity and that they expected housing activity to remain weak .
 A couple of participants remarked on anecdote s or concerns from builder contacts about contract cancellations by purchasers no longer able to qualify for loans at higher interest rates.
" With regard to the business sector, participants noted that growth in investment spending appeared modest and was being restrained by high borrowing costs and an outlook for slow growth of final demand, although views on investment prospects varied across businesses and Districts."
" Participants observed that the labor market had remained very tight, with the unemployment rate near a historically low level, robust payroll gains, a high level of job vacancies, and elevated nominal wage growth."
" Nevertheless, they noted that some other measures of employment —such as those based on the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ household survey and the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages —suggest ed that  job growth  in 2022 may have been weaker than indicated by payroll employment ."
" Participants generally concluded that there remained a large imbalance between labor supply and labor demand, as indicated by the stilllarge number of  job openings  and elevated nominal wage growth."
" Participants commented that labor demand had remained strong to date despite the slowdown in economic growth, with a few remarking that some busines s contacts  reported that they would be keen to retain workers even in the face of slowing demand  for output  because of their recent experiences of labor shortages and hiring challenges."
" Under  an appropriately restrictive path of monetary policy,  participants expected labor market supply and demand to come into better balance over time, easing upward pressures on nominal wages and prices."
" In the context of achieving the Committee’s broad -based and inclusive maximum -employment goal , a number of  participants  commented that as the labor market moved  into better balance, the unemployment rate for some demographic groups —particularly African Americans and Hispanics —would likely increase by more than the national average."
"With inflation still well above the Committee’s longer -run goal of 2 percent, participants agreed that inflation was unacceptably high."
" Participants concurred that  the inflation data received for October and November showed welcome reductions in the monthly pace of price increases, but they stressed that it would take substantially more evidence of progress  to be confident that inflation was on a sustained downward path."
" S ome participants  also noted that, by some measures , firms’ markups were still elevated and that a continued subdued expansion in aggregate demand would likely be needed to reduce remaining upward pressure on  inflation ."
" Regarding housing services inflation, many participants  observed that measures of rent based on new leases were indicating a deceleration, which would be reflected in the measures of  shelter inflation with some lag."
" Participants noted that , in the latest inflation data, the pace of increase for prices of core services excluding shelter —which represents the largest component of core PCE price inflation —was high."
 They also remarked that this component of inflation has tended to be closely linked to nominal wage growth and therefore would likely remain persistently elevated if the labor market remained very tight.
" Consequently, while there were few signs of adverse  wageprice dynamics at present, they assessed that bringing down this component of inflation to mandateconsistent levels would require some softening in the growth of labor demand to bring the labor market back into better balance."
"  Participants observed  that measures from surveys of households and businesses as well as from financial markets generally indicated that longer -term inflation expectations remained well anchored, while shortterm inflation expectations had come down."
" However, participants stressed that the Committee’s ongoing monetary policy tightening to achieve a stance that will  be sufficiently restrictive to return  inflation to 2 percent is essential for ensuring that longer -term expectations remain well anchored."
" Several participants  commented that the longer inflation remained well above the 2 percent goal, the greater the risk that longer -term inflation expectations could become unanchored."
" Such a development, if it materialized, would make it much more costly to bring inflation down to achieve the Committee’s statutory objectives of maximum employment and price stability."
" However, a couple of them  also noted that the current inver sion of the yield curve could reflect, in part, that investors expect the nominal policy rate to decline because of a fall in inflation over time."
Participants generally noted that the uncertainty associated with their economic outlooks was high and that the risks to the inflation outlook remained tilted to the upside.
" Participants saw  a number of uncertainties surrounding the outlook for inflation stemming from factors abroad, such as  China’s relaxation of its ze roCOVID policies, Russia’s continuing war against Ukraine, and effects of synchronous policy firming by major central banks."
  A number of participants judged that the risks to the outlook for economic activity were weighted to the downside.
" They noted that sources of such risks included the potential for more persistent inflation inducing more restrictive policy responses, the prospect of unexpected negative shocks tipping the economy into a recession in an environment of subdued growth, and the possibili ty of households’ and businesses’ concerns about the outlook restraining their spending sufficiently to reduce aggregate output ."
" In their consideration of appropriate monetary policy actions at this meeting, participants concurred that the Committee had made significant progress over the past year in moving toward a sufficiently  restrictive stance of monetary policy."
" Even so, participants agreed that inflation remained well above the Committee’s longer -run goal of 2  percent, while the labor market remained very tight, contributing to upward pressures on wages and prices ."
" Participants observed that a slowing in the pace of rate increases at this meeting would better allow the Committee to assess the economy’s progress toward the Committee’s goals of maximum employment and price stability, as monetary policy approached a stance that was sufficiently restrictive to achieve these goals."
" In determining the pace of future increases i n the target range, participants judged that it would be appropriate to take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments."
" With inflation staying persistently above the Committee’s 2 percent goal and the labor market remaining very tight, all participants had raised their assessment of the appropriate path of the federal funds rate relative to their assessment at the time of th e September meeting."
"  Participants  generally observed that a restrictive policy stance would need to be maintained until the incoming data pr ovided confidence that inflation was on a sustained downward path to 2 percent, which was likely to take some time."
" In view of the persistent and unacceptably high level of inflation, several  participants commented that historical experience cautioned against prematurely loosening monetary policy."
" In light of the heightened uncertainty regarding the outlooks for both inflation and real economic activity, most  participants emphasized the need to retain flexibility and optionality when moving policy to a more restrictive stance."
" Participants generally noted that the Committee’s future decisions regarding policy would continue to be informed by the incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation, and that the Committee would continue to make decisions meeting by meeting."
 Participants reaffirmed their strong commitment to returning inflation to the Committee’s 2 percent objective.
 A number of participants emphasized that it would be important to clearly communicate that a slowing in the pace of rate increases was not an indication of any weakening of the Committee’s resolve to achieve its pricestability goal or a judgment that inflation was already on a persistent downward path.
" Participants noted  that, because monetary policy worked importantly through financial markets, an unwarranted easing in financial conditions, especially if driven by a misperception by the public of the Committee’s reaction function, would complicate the Committee’s effort to restore price stability."
" Several  participants commented that the medians of participants’ assessments for the appropriate path of the federal funds rate in the Summary of Economic Projections , which tracked  notably above marketbased Minutes of the Meeting of December 13–14, 2022Page 9_____________________________________________________________________________________________  measures of policy rate expectations, underscored the Committee’s strong commitment to returning inflation to its 2 percent goal."
  Participants discussed a number of risk -management considerati ons related to the conduct of monetary policy.
" One risk was that an insufficiently restrictive monetary policy could cause inflation to remain above the Committee’s target for longer than anticipated , leading to unanchored  inflation expectations  and eroding the purchasing power of households , especially for those already facing difficulty making ends meet."
"  The other risk was that the lagged cumulative effect of policy tightening could end up being more restrictive than is necessary to bring down inflation to 2 percent and lead to an unnecessary reduction in economic activity, potentially placing the largest burdens on the most vulnerable groups of the population."
 Participants generally indicated that upside risks to the inflation outlook remained a key factor shaping the outlook for policy.
 A  couple of participants noted that risks to the inflation outlook were becoming more balanced.
  Participants generally observed that maintaining a restrictive policy stance for a sustained period until inflation is clearly on a path toward 2 percent is appropriate from a risk -management perspective.
