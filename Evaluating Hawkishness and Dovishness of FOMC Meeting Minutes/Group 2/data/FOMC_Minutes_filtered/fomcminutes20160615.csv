" Market participants’ expectations for a firming of monetary policy at the June FOMC meeting rose considerably in the middle of the period, largely in response to monetary policy communications, but those expectations subsequently fell sharply following the release of labor market data for May."
" Forward me asures of inflation compensation derived from yields on nominal and inflationindexed Treasury securities fell despite an appreciable increase in crude oil prices, a development that contrasted with the positive correlation between these variables that had been evident for some time."
" Consumer price inflation continued to run below the Committee’s longerrun objective of 2 percent, restrained in part by earlier decreases in energy prices an d in prices of nonenergy imports."
" Surveybased measures of longerrun inflation expectations were mixed in recent months, while marketbased measures of inflation compen sation declined from levels that were already low."
"Total nonfarm payroll employment gains slowed in April and May, even after adjusting for the effects of a strike at a large telecommunications  company."
" The unemployment rate dropped to 4.7 percent in May, partly reflecting an unusually large numb er of unemployed persons exiting the labor force."
" Over the first two months of the second quarter, both the labor  force participation rate and the employmentto-population ratio moved down on net."
" The fourweek moving average of initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits moved up a little, on net, from late April to early June but was still at a low level."
 Labor productivity growth remained slow over the four quarters ending in the first quarter of 2016.
" Measures of labor compensation continued to rise at a mo derate pace on balance:  Compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector increased 3¾ percent over the four quarters ending in the first quarter, the employment cost index for private workers rose 1¾ percent over the 12 months ending in March, and average hourly earnings for all employees increased 2½ percent over the 12 months ending in May."
"The unemployment rates for African Americans and for Hispanics stayed above the rate for whites, although the differentials in jobless rates across the different groups were similar to those before the most recent recession."
Growth in real personal consumption expenditures (PCE) appeared to be picking up in the second quarter.
 The apparent pickup  in real PCE growth was consistent with recent readings on key factors that influence consumer spending.
"The U.S. international trade deficit narrowed substantially in March, with a sharp decline in imports more than offsetting a fall in exports."
" In April, the deficit widened as imports recovered somewhat, bu t it remained narrower than its firstquarter average."
" Core PCE price inflation, which excludes ch anges in food and energy prices, was a little above 1½ percent over the same  12month period, held down in  part by decreases in the prices of nonenergy imports over much of this period and the passthrough of the declines in energy prices to prices of other goods and services."
" Over the 12 months ending in April, total consumer prices as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) also rose about 1 percent, while core CPI inflation was a little above 2 percent."
" The Michigan survey measure of longerrun inflation expectations fell to its lowe st level on record in early June, but other measures of such expectations—including those from the Survey of Professional Forecasters and from the Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants—were generally little changed, on balance, in recent months."
"Foreign real GDP growth picked up in the first quarter, supported by relatively robu st increases in Canada, the euro area, Japan, and Mexico."
" However, the pace of growth appeared to slow in  many foreign economies in the second quarter, although in some cases as a result of what were likely to be temporary disruptions, including wildfires in Canada and an ea rthquake in Japan."
" In contrast, indicators for emerging Asia, including China, suggested that economic growth picked up in the second quarter."
" Inflation remained low in the advanced foreign economies (AFEs), in part reflecting previous declines in energy prices."
 Inflation also contin ued to be subdued in most emerging market economies (EMEs).
" On balance, it flattened, largely in response to the disappointing May employment report and growing concerns among investors about the British referendum on membership in the European Union."
" The probability of an increase in June fell to near zero in early May in response to incoming econom ic data, jumped to about 30 percent after the release of the April FOMC minutes and other Federa l Reserve communications, and dropped again to near zero after the May employment report."
" Although a significant portion of Page 4 Federal Open Market Committee____________________________________________________________________________________________ _the declines in yields occurred following the release of the May employment report, yields at longer maturities had begun drifting down earlie r in the period, consistent with an apparent deteriorati on in global risk sentiment."
" Inflation compensation based on Treasury InflationProtected Securities (TIPS) decreased, particularly at longer tenors."
" Measures of inflation compensation based on inflation swap s also declined, but less than TIPSbased measures, consistent with anecdotal reports suggesting that a porti on of the declines in TIPSbased measures might have be en driven by elevated demand for longerterm nominal Treasury securities."
" Growth of commercial and industrial (C&I) loans on banks’ books remained strong in April and May, particularly at large banks."
" Consumer loan balances continue d to increase at a robust pace in recent months, with  yearover-year growth in credit card balances outstand ing continuing to trend upward."
 Interest rates on 30year fixedrate mortgages declined and continued to be low by historical standards.
"Over the intermeeting period , developments in global financial markets were  driven in large part by shifting views on the expected path of  U.S. monetary policy and by fluctuating expectations about the outcome of the U.K. vote on membership in the European Union."
 The exchange value of the U.S. dollar rose in the middle of the intermeeting period along with expectations for less accommodative Federal Reserve monetary policy.
" However, the dollar partially retraced these increases following the much weakerthan-expected U.S. employment report for May, finishing the pe riod a bit stronger against the currencies of the AFEs and about 3 percent higher against EME currencies."
"Staff Economic Outlook In the U.S. economic forecast prepared by the staff for the June FOMC meeting, real GDP growth was estimated to have been faster in the first quarter than in the April forecast, and the incoming information was consistent with a moderate pickup in GDP growth in the second quarter."
 Real GDP was projected to rise a little slower in the second half of th is year than in the previous forecast and to increase at about the same pace thereafter; the small boosts to real  GDP growth implied by a lower assumed path for interest rates and by a slightly stronger trajectory for home values were essentially offset by restraint from higher  projected paths for the foreign exchange value of the dollar and for oil prices.
" The unempl oyment rate was expected to remain relatively flat over  the second half of the year and then to gradually decline further; over this period, the unemployment rate was projected to run somewhat below the staff’s estimate of its longerrun natural rate."
The staff’s forecast for inflation was little changed from the previous projection.
" The staff continued to project that inflation would increase over the next several years, as energy prices and the pr ices of nonenergy imports were expected to begin steadily rising this year."
" However, inflation was still projected to be slightly below the Committee’s longerrun objective of 2 percent in 2018."
"The staff viewed the uncertainty around its April projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as similar to the average of the past 20 years."
" Consistent with the downside risks to aggregate demand, the staff viewed the risks to its outlook for the unemployment rate as tilted to the upside."
" The risks to the projection for inflation were still judged as weighted to the downside, reflecting the possibility that 4 One participant did not submit longerrun projections in conjunction with the June 2016 FOMC meeting."
longerterm inflation exp ectations may have edged down.
"Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, members of the Board of Governors and Federal Reserv e Bank presidents submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, inflation, and the federal funds rate for each year from 2016 through 2018 and over the longer run.4  Each participant’s projections were conditioned on his or her judgment of appropriate mone tary policy."
" The longerrun projections represented each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over ti me, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy."
" Although the unemployment rate had declined, job gains had diminished."
Growth in household spending had strengthened.
" Inflation had continued to run below the Committee’s 2 percent longerrun objective, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and in prices of nonenergy imports."
" Market-based measures of inflat ion compensation declined; most surveybased measures of longerterm inflation expectations were little change d, on balance, in recent months."
"Participants generally expected  that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of mone tary policy, economic activity would expand at a modera te pace and labor market indicators would strengthen."
" Inflation was expected to remain low in the near term, in part because of earlier declines in energy prices, but to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of past declines in energy and import prices dissipated and the labor market strengthened further."
 Participants generally agreed that the Committee should continue to closely Page 6 Federal Open Market Committee____________________________________________________________________________________________ _monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments.
Growth of consumer spending  appeared to have picked up from its slow pace in the first quarter.
" However, a few participants expressed caution about the outlook for consumer expenditur es, noting that slower increases in employment and hi gher energy prices could restrain spending."
 Those indicators were mixed rega rding the pace of economic activity within the manufacturing sector.
" While weakness in the drilling and mining sector was attributable to the earlier declines in oil prices, participants identified a variety of potential causes of the broader weakness in investment spending, including a slowdown in co rporate profits, concern about prospects for economic growth, heightened uncertainty regarding the future course of domestic regulatory and fiscal policies, and a persistent reluctance on the part of firms to undertake new projects in the wake of the financial crisis."
 A couple of participants also noted that elevated inve ntory levels could be a drag on economic growth in the ne ar term.
"The employment report for May showed considerably weaker growth in payrolls than had been expected, and gains in previous months were revised down."
" Although the unemployment rate fell in  May, a drop in labor force participation accounted for the decline."
" Many participants observed that, because of transitory factors, such as statistical noise and the effects of a strike in the telecommunications industry, the reported rate of payroll job growth likely unders tated its underlying pace; however, many participants thought that the underlying pace had slowed some from that of previous months."
" These indicators included a number of regional surveys of labor market conditions, relati vely low levels of initial claims for unemployment insu rance, surveys of business hiring plans, and positive views of labor market conditions in recent consumer surv eys."
" In contrast, some noted that the lower rate of  payroll gains could instead be indicative of a broader slowdown in growth of economic activity that was also evidenced by other downbeat labor market indicators, such as a decline in the diffusion indexes of industry payrolls, an increase in the number of workers reporting that they were working part time for economic reasons,  or the recent sharp drop in labor force participation."
" Finally, a few participants Minutes of the Meeting of June 14–15, 2016 Page 7 ____________________________________________________________________________________________ _suggested that the weak employment growth may instead reflect supply constraints associated with a general tightening of labor market conditions."
Almost all participants judged that the surprisingly weak May employment report increased their uncertainty about the outlook for the labor market.
 Participants generally expected  to see a resumption of monthly gains in payroll employment that would be sufficient to promote continued strengthening of the labor market.
" However, some note d that with labor market conditions at or near those consistent with maximum employment, it would be reasonable to anticipate that gains in payroll employment  would soon moderate from the pace seen over the past few years."
"Inflation continued to run below the Committee’s 2 percent longerrun objective, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and in prices of nonenergy imports."
" Core PCE price inflation registered an increase of 1.6 percent for the 12 months ending in April, while recent readings on retail energy prices moved up notably."
 Most participants expected to  see continued progress toward the Committee’s 2 percent inflation objective.
" They viewed the firming in some measures of core inflation, the evidence that wage growth was picking up, the ongoing tightening of resour ce utilization, the recent firming in oil prices, and the stabilization of the foreign exchange value of the dollar this year as factors likely to boost inflation over time."
" Ho wever, other participants were less confident that inflation would return to its target level over the medium term."
" They also saw important downside risks, incl uding persistent disinflationary pressures from very low inflation and weak economic growth abroad as well as the softening in some surveybased measures of lo ngerterm inflation expectations and marketbased measures of inflation compensation."
"Global financial conditions ha d improved since earlier in the year, and recent data on net exports suggested that the drag on domestic economic activity from the external sector had abated somewh at."
" Some participants indicated that prospects for economic activity in many foreign ec onomies appeared to be subdued, that global inflation and interest rates remained very low by historical standards, and that recurring bouts of global financial market in stability remained a risk."
 Many participants commented that the level of the federal funds rate consistent with maintaining trend econ omic growth—the socalled neutral rate—appeared to be lower currently or was likely to be lower in the longer run than they had estimated earlier.
" While recogn izing that the longerrun neutral rate was highly uncert ain, many judged that it would likely remain low relative to historical standards, held down by factors such as  slow productivity growth and demographic trends."
 Most participants indicated that they made only small changes to their forecasts for achieving and maintaining the Committee’s objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation over the medium term.
" Most judged that they would need to accumulate additional information on the labor market, production, and spending to help clarify how the economy was evolving in order to evaluate whether the stance of monetary policy should be adjusted."
"Most participants judged that, in the absence of significant economic or financial shocks, raising the target range for the federal funds rate would be appropriate if incoming information confirmed that economic growth had picked up, that job gains were continuing at a pace sufficient to sustain progress toward the Committee’s maximumemployment objective, and that inflation was likely to rise to 2 percent over the medium term."
 They also pointed out that core inflation had begun to move up and that the transitory factors that had been holding down headline inflation were receding.
" Several of them noted downside risks to the outlook for growth in economic activi ty and for further improvement in labor market conditions, including the possibility that the sharp slowdown in employment gains and the continued weakness in bu siness fixed investment signaled a downshift in economic growth, as well as the potential for global economic or  financial shocks."
" Moreover, several of them worried about the declines in measures of inflation compensation and in some surveybased measures of inflation expectations and suggested that monetary policy may need to remain accommodative for some time in order to move inflation closer to 2 percent on a sustained basis."
" A few pointed out that with inflation likely to rema in low for some time and to rise only gradually, mainta ining an accommodative stance of policy could extend the strengthening of the labor market."
" In addition, se veral participants observed that because shortterm interest rates were still near zero, monetary policy could, if ne cessary, respond more effectively to surprisingly strong inflationary pressures in the future than to a weakening in the labor market and falling inflation."
"A number of participants emphasized that the Committee’s approach to policysetting was necessarily data dependent given the uncertainties associated with mediumterm forecasts of economic activity and, accordingly, with the appropriate policy pa th over the medium term."
" Several participants expressed concern that the Committee’s communications had not been fully effective in informing the public how incoming information affected the Committee’s view of the economic outlook, its degree of confidence in the outlook, or the implications for the trajectory of monetary policy."
"Committee Policy Action In their consideration of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that the information received since the Committee met in April indicated that the pace of improvement in labor mark et conditions had slowed in recent months while growth in economic activity appeared to have picked up from the low rates recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016."
" Although the unemployment rate had declined over the intermeeting period, job ga ins had diminished."
" After only a modest increase early in the year, growth in household spending had strengthened  in recent months."
" Inflation continued to run below the Committee’s 2 percent objective, partly  reflecting declines in energy prices and in prices of nonenerg y imports."
 Marketbased measures of inflation comp ensation declined over the intermeeting period; most surveybased measures of inflation expectations were little changed.
"With respect to the economic outlook and its implications for monetary policy, me mbers continued to expect Minutes of the Meeting of June 14–15, 2016 Page 9 ____________________________________________________________________________________________ _that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity would expand at a moderate pace and labor market indi cators would strengthen."
 Most members made only sm all changes to their forecasts for economic activity and the labor market.
" Most judged it appropriate to avoid overweighting one or two labor market reports in thei r consideration of the economic outlook, but they indicated that the recent slowing in payroll employment ga ins had increased their uncertainty about the likely pa ce of improvements in the labor market going forward."
" Many noted that the slowdown could be a temporary aberration and that other labor market indicators—such as new claims for unemployment insurance, the rate  of job openings, and readings on consumers’ percepti ons of the labor market—remained positive."
 Some of them judged that labor market conditions were now at or close to the Committee’s objectives and pointed out that some moderation in employment gains was to be expected when such conditions were near those consis tent with maximum employment.
"Members expected inflation to remain low in the near term, in part because of earlier declines in energy prices, but most anticipated that inflation would rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of past declines in energy and import prices dissipated and the labor market strengthened  further."
" Although headline inflation continued to run below the Committee’s objective, some members observed that core inflation had risen, and one member noted that the annual rate of increase in core PCE inflation in the first quarter had exceeded 2 percent."
" However , several others continued to see downside risks to inflation, citing the decline in inflation expectations and the risk of adverse shocks to U.S. economic activity from developments abroad."
" In light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, the Committee agreed to continue carefully monitoring actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal."
"After assessing the outlook fo r economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, and after weighing the uncertainties associated with the outlook, members agreed to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged at ¼ to ½ percent at this meeting."
"  S o m e  o f  t h e m  e m p h a s i z e d  t h a t ,  w i t h  l a b o r  market conditions and inflation at or close to the Committee’s objectives, taking another step in removing monetary accommodation s hould not be delayed too long."
" However, a couple of  members underscored that they would need to accumulate sufficient evidence to increase their confidence that economic growth was strong enough to withstand a possible downward shock to demand and that inflation was moving closer to 2 percent on a sustained basis."
"Members reiterated that, in determining the timing and size of future adjustments to  the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee would assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation."
" This assessment would take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
" In that regard, they judged it appropriate to continue to leave their policy options open and maintain the flexibility to adjust the stance of policy based on how incoming information affected the Committee’s assessment of the outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation as well as the risks to the outlook."
 The Committee also directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve’s agency mortgagebacked securities transactions.” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p.m.: “Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in April indicates that the pace of improvement in the labor market has slowed while growth in economic activity appears to have picked up.
" Although the unemployment rate has de clined, job gains have diminished."
 Growth in household spending has strengthened.
" Inflation has continued to run below the Committee’s 2 percent longerrun objective, partly reflecting earlier de clines in energy prices and in prices of nonen ergy imports."
" Marketbased measures of inflation compensation declined; most surveybased measures of longerterm inflation ex pectations are little changed, on balance, in recent months."
"Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
" The Committee currently expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market indicators will strengthen."
" Inflation is expected to remain low in the near term, in pa rt because of earlier declines in energy prices, but to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of past declines in en ergy and import prices dissipate and the labo r market strengthens further."
 The Committee continues to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments.
" The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting further improvement in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation."
"In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation."
" Th is assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
" In light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, the Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal."
"Madigan SecretaryPage 12 Federal Open Market Committee____________________________________________________________________________________________ _Summary of Economic Projections  In conjunction with the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting held on June 14–15, 2016, meeting participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real output growth, the unemployment rate, inflation, and the federal funds rate for each year from 2016 to 2018 and over the longer run.1  Each participant’s projection was based on information available at the time of the meeting, together with his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy and assumptions about the factors likely to affect economic outcomes."
" The longerrun proj ections represent each participant’s assessment of the value to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy."
 “A ppropriate monetary policy” is defined as the future path of policy that each participant deems most likely to fo ster outcomes for economic activity and inflation that best satisfy his or her individual interpretation of the Federa l Reserve’s objectives of maximum employment and stable prices.
"FOMC participants generally expected that, under appropriate monetary policy, grow th in real gross domestic product (GDP) this year, next year, and in 2018 would be at or quite close to their individual estimates of GDP growth over the longer run."
 All but a few participants projected that the unemployment  rate at the end of this year will be at or below its longerrun normal rate and expected it to edge lower ne xt year.
" Almost all participants projected that inflation, as measured by the fourquarter percentage change in the pr ice index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), would increase this year and over the next two years, and most expected inflation to have converged to the Committee’s objective of 2 percent by 2018."
"As shown in figure 2, almost all participants expected that it would be appropriate for the target range for the federal funds rate to rise gradually as the economy steadily progresses toward the Committee’s longerrun goals of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation."
"Participants generally viewed the level of uncertainty associated with their individual forecasts for economic growth, unemployment, and inflation as broadly similar to the norms of the previous 20 years."
" Most participants also judged the risks around their projections for economic activity and inflatio n as broadly balanced, although many participants saw the risks to their GDP growth and inflation forecasts as weighted to the downside."
"The Outlook for Economic Activity The median of participants’ projections for the growth rate of real GDP, conditio nal on their individual assumptions about appropriat e monetary policy, was 2 percent for each year from 2016 through 2018, the same as the median of their projections of the longerrun GDP growth rate."
" However, a majority of participants expected that real GDP growth would pick up a bit in 2017 from this year’s pace, and most expected it to remain at or above their esti mates of its longerrun pace in 2018."
" Participants pointed to a number of factors that they expected would contribute to moderate output growth over the next few years, including a diminution of the drag on net exports from a strong dollar, the continued improvements in hou sehold and business balance sheets, accommodative financ ial conditions, and somewhat more supportive fiscal policy."
Participants’ median projecti ons for real GDP growth in 2016 and 2017 were slightly lower than the medians shown in the March 2016 Su mmary of Economic Projections (SEP).
" Participants who lowered their projections for nearterm GDP grow th generally attributed their revisions to weakerthan-expected growth in the first quarter and soft readin gs on economic activity in recent months, particularly t hose on business spending."
" Although several participants also reduced their forecasts for real GDP growth in 2018 and in the longer run, Page 1 ____________________________________________________________________________________________ _Table 1."

"The median of projections for the unemployment rate edged down from 4.7 percent at the end of 2016 to 4.6 percent in 2017 and remained at that level in 2018, modestly below the median assessment of the longerrun normal unemployment rate of 4.8 percent."
Figures 3.A and 3.B show th e distributions of participants’ projections for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate from 2016 through 2018 and in the longer run.
 The distribution of individual projections of GDP growth for 2016 shifted lower relative to the distribution of the March projections.
 The distributions of projections for GDP growth over the next two years and in the longer run also shifted down.
" For this year and next, the distributions of projections for the unemployment rate were little changed, while the distribution for 2018 became less dispersed."
"The Outlook for Inflation In the June SEP, the median of projections for headline PCE price inflation in 2016 was 1.4 percent, a bit higher than in March."
" Many partic ipants pointed to strongerthan-expected readings on inflation early this year, as well as to the recent stabilizat ion of oil prices, as factors contributing to the upward revision to their inflation projections."
" The projections for headline PCE price inflation over the next two years  and in the longer run were little changed since March, with the median inflation projection still rising to 1.9 percent in 2017 and to the Committee’s objective of 2 percent in 2018."
 Almost all participants projected that inflation will be within 0.1 percentage point of the Committee’s objective by 2018.
 The median of individual projections for core PCE price inflation also increases gradually over the next two years.
  Figures 3.C and 3.D provide information on the distribution of participants’ views about the outlook for inflation.
 The distribution of projections for headline PCE price inflation for this year sh ifted up relative to projections for the March meeting.
" The distribution of projections for core PCE price inflation this year also moved 2 One participant’s projections for the federal funds rate, GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation were informed by the view that there are mult iple possible mediumterm regimes for the U.S. economy, that these regimes are persistent, and that the economy shifts between regimes in a way that   to the right on balance."
" For 2017 and 2018, the distributions of projections for bo th total and core PCE price inflation were nearly unchanged."
Appropriate Monetary Policy Figure 3.E provides the dist ribution of participants’ judgments regarding the appropriate level of the target federal funds rate at the end of each year from 2016 to 2018 and over the longer run.2  The distributions for 2016 to 2018 and for the longer run shifted to the left.
"Participants’ projections for the path of the federal funds rate represented their individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy consistent with their projections of economic growth, employment, inflation, and other factors."
" In discussing their June forecasts, many participants expressed a view that increases in the federal funds rate over the next several years would need to be gradual in light of a shortterm neutral interest rate that was currently low—a phenomenon that several participants attributed to the persistence of factors that restrained spending over recent years—and that was likely to rise only slowly as the effects of those factors faded over time."
 Some participants noted the proximity of shortterm nominal interest rates to the effective lower bound as limiting the Committee’s ab ility to increase monetary accommodation to counter adverse shocks to the economy should they occur.
" Under this view, the economy currently is in a regime characterized by expansion of economic activity with low productivity growth and a low shortterm real interest rate, but longerterm outcomes cannot be usefully projected."

" Particip ants cited a number of factors that pushed down their projections of the longerrun rate, including domest ic and global demographic trends and weak productivity growth, which together imply a slower pace of trend output growth."
"Uncertainty and Risks  The lefthand column of figure 4 shows that all but a few participants judged the levels of uncertainty around their June projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and headline and core PCE price inflation to be broadly similar to the average levels of the past 20 years.3  A few participants saw the uncertainty about G D P  g r o w t h  a s  h i g h e r  t h a n  i t s  h i s t o r i c a l  a v e r a g e ,  u p  from only one in March."
 Th ese participants cited the surprisingly weak productivity  growth of recent years or the continuing fragile nature of the global economic environment as supporting such a view.
"As in March, most participants judged the risks to their projections of GDP growth and the unemployment rate to be broadly balanced, althou gh many still assessed the risks to GDP growth as weighted to the downside and some saw the risks to the unemployment rate as tilted to the upside (top two panels in the righthand column of figure 4)."
" Participants who saw the risks to growth as tilted to the downside attributed this assessment to the weakerthan-expected May employment report; recent softness in business fixed investment; concerns about the global economic environment, including possible economic and financial consequences of the upcoming British referendum on European Union membership; or the proximity of shortterm nominal interest rates to the effective lower bound."
 A majority of participants judged the risks to their inflation pr ojections to be broadly balanced.
" However, many viewed the risks to inflation as skewed to the downside, although fewer than in March."
 A couple of participants pointed to the firming of some measures of inflation in recent months as contributing to the change in their risk assessment.
" Among those who continued to judge that the risks to inflation were weighted to the downside, almost all cited recent declines in measures of inflation compensation and some surveybased measures of longerrun inflation expectations as reasons for that assessment."
"   3 Table 2 provides estimates of the forecast uncertainty for the change in real GDP, the unemployment rate, and total consumer price inflation over the period from 1996 through 2015."
 ±1.4 ±2.0 ±2.2 Unemployment rate1 .
" As described in the box “Forecast Uncertainty,” under certain assumptions, there is about a 70 percent probability that actual outcomes for real GDP, unemployment, and consumer prices will be in ranges implied by the average size of projection errors made in the past."

"Table 2 summarizes the average historical accuracy of a range of forecasts, including those reported in past Monetary Policy Report s and those prepared by the Federal Reserve Board’s staff in advance of meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee."
 The corresponding 70 percent confidence intervals for overall inflation would be 1.2 to 2.8 percent in the current year and 1.0 to 3.0 percent in the second and third years.
"As with real activity and inflation, the outlook for the future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable uncertainty."
 This uncertainty arises primarily because ea ch participant’s assessment of the appropriate stance of monetary policy depends importantly on the evolution of real activity and inflation over time.
