" Respondents saw upside inflation risks, albeit less than in March."
" Labor market conditions remained tight in March, as job gains were robust and the unemployment rate was low."
 Consumer price inflation —as measured by the 12 -month percent  change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE)—continued to be elevated in March.
" Li mited data were available on economic activity during  the period after the onset of banking -sector stress in mid -March, although  several recent surveys —such as the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS)  in April, the National Federation of Independent Business’s survey in March, and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Survey of Consumer Expectations in March —indicated that bank credit conditions were tightening further."
" The pace of increase s in total nonfarm payroll employment slowed in March but was still robust, and the unemployment rate ticked down to 3.5  percent ."
" The unemployment rate for African Americans fell to 5.0 percent, and the jobless rate for Hispanics dropped to 4.6 percent ."
 The aggregate measures of both the labor force pa rticipation rate and the employment -topopula-tion ratio edged up.

" Over the year en ding in March , the employment cost index (ECI) for private -sector workers increased 4.8 percent , down from its peak of 5.5  percent  over the year ending in June  of last year."
 Consumer price inflation remained elevated in March but continued to slow.
" Total PCE price inflation was 4.2 percent  over the 12 months ending in March, and core PCE price inflation —which excludes changes in consumer energy prices and many consumer food prices —was 4.6  percent ; the total inflation measure was down markedly from it s level in January, while the core measure was only slightly lower."
 The trimmed mean measure of 12 -month PCE price inflation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas was 4.7  percent  in March.
" Real GDP growth was modest in the first quarter, led by an increase in PCE."
" Growth in business fixed investment slowed further in the first quarter, and new orders  for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft continued to decline in March, pointing to weakness in capital goods shipments in the near term."
" Net export s made a small positive contribution to GDP growth in the first quarter, as exports rebounded more strongly than imports from their fourth -quarter declines."
" Foreign economic activity rebounded in the first quarter, reflecting the reopening of China’s economy from its COVID -19related shutdowns, a pickup in the economies of C anada and Mexico, and the resilience of Europe’s economy to the energy price shock from Russia’s war on Ukraine; a mild winter also helped reduce energy demand in Europe."
" In contrast, economic growth elsewhere in emerging Asia was weak in the first quarte r mainly due to a pronounced techcycle slowdown."
 A slowing of retail energy inflation continued to contribute to an easing of headline consumer price inflation in many advanced foreign economies (AFEs).
 Core inflation showed signs of easing in some foreign economies but remained persistently elevated amid tight labor markets.
" Accordingly, many foreign central banks continued their monetary policy tightening."
" Staff Review of the Financial Situation  Market sentiment improved over the intermeeting period, with concerns about a sharp near -term deceleration in economic activity appearing to recede as stress in the banking sector declined."
" Yields on n ominal Treasury securities with maturities greater than one year moved lower, and inflation compensation at mediumand long -term horizons edged down slightly."

 The ability of nonfinancial firms to service their debt kept pace with rising debt loads and interest rates.
 The majority of the banking system had been able to effectively manage this interest rate risk exposure.
"  However, the failure of three banks resulting from poor interest rate risk and liquidity risk management ha d put stress on some additional banks."
 Real GDP growth over 2024 and 2025 was projected to be below the staff’s estimate of potential output growth.
" The unemployment rate was forecast to increase this year, to peak next year, and then to start declining gradually in  2025."
" Resource utilization in both product and labor markets was forecast to loosen, with the level of real output moving below the staff’s estimate of potential output in early 2024 and the unemployment rate rising above the staff’s estimate of its natu ral rate at that time."
 The staff’s core inflation forecast was revised up a little relative to the previous projection.
" Recent data for core PCE goods prices and the ECI measure of wage growth —the latter of which importantly influences the staff’s project ion of core nonhousing services inflation—came in above expectations, and the staff judged that supply –demand imbalances in both goods markets and labor markets were easing a bit more slowly than anticipated."
" On a four -quarter change basis, total PCE price inflation was projected to be 3.1  percent  this year, with core inflation at 3.8  percent ."
" Core goods inflation was projected to move down further this year and then remain subdued, housing services inflation was expected to have about peaked in the first quarter and to move down over the rest of the year, and  core nonhousing services inflation was forecast to slow gradually as nominal wage growth eased further."
" Reflecting the projected effects of less tightness in resource utilization, core inflation was forecast to slow through next year but remain moderately above 2  percent ."
" With expected  declines in consumer energy prices and a substantial moderation in food price inflation, total inflation was projected to run below core inflation this year and next."
" In 2025, both total and core PCE price inflation were expected to be at about 2  percent ."
" If banking -secto r stress were to abate more quickly or have less of an effect on macroeconomic conditions than assumed in the baseline, then the risks would be tilted to the upside for economic activity and inflation, a scenario that the staff viewed as only a little less  likely than the baseline."
" If banking and financial conditions and their effects on macroeconomic conditions were to deteriorate more than assumed in the baseline, then the risks around the baseline would be skewed to the downside for economic activity an d inflation."
" On balance, the staff saw the risks around the baseline inflation forecast as tilted to the upside, as an upside economic scenario with higher inflation appeared more likely than a downside scenario with lower inflation, and because inflation  could continue to be more persistent than expected and inflation expectations could become unanchored after a long period of elevated inflation."
" Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook  In their discussion of current economic conditions, participants noted that economic activity had expanded at a modest pace in the first quarter."
" Nonetheless, job gains had been robust in recent months, and the unemployment rate had remained low."
 Inflation remained elevated.
" They commented that tighter credit conditions for households and businesses were likely to weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation."
" Against this background, participants concurred that they remained highly attentive to inflation risks."
" In assessing the economic outlook, participants noted that the growth rate of real GDP in the first quarter of this year was modest despite a pickup in consumer spending, as inventory investment —a volatile category—declined substantially."
 Pa rticipants assessed that the cumulative tightening of monetary policy over the past year ha d contributed significantly to more restrictive financial conditions .
" They also judged that banking -sector stress would likely weigh further on economic activity, but the extent to which that would be the case remained highly uncertain."
" With inflation well above the Committee’s longer -run 2 percent  objective, and core inflation showing only some signs of moderation, participants expected that a period of below -trend growth in real GDP and some softening in labor market conditions would be needed to bring aggregate supply and aggregate demand into better balance and reduce inflationary pressures  over time ."
" Participants judged that stress in the banking sector would, in coming quarters, likely induce banks to tighten lending standards by more than they would have in response to higher interest rates alone ."
" However , participants  gener ally noted  that it was too early to assess with confidence the magnitude and persistence of these effects on economic activity."
" They also remarked that the quarterly strength was driven mainly by very strong spending growth in January, while real spending fell modestly over February and March ."
" Participants remarked that higher interest rates would continue to restrain  interest -sensitive expenditures  by households , such as those on housing and durable goods."
" A few par ticipants remarked that there had been some ongoing reduction in consumers’ discretionary expenditures in the face of elevated inflation and higher borrowing rates, especially among lower - and middle -income households; some of those declines were reportedly driven by shifts in purchases toward lower -cost options."
" Regarding the business sector, participants observed that growth in business fixed investment was subdued in the first quarter, reflecting relatively high borrowing costs , weak growth of business -sector output , and businesses’ increasing concerns about the general economic outlook."
" Participants noted that the labor market remained very tight, with robust payroll g ains in March and an  unemployment rate near historically low levels."
" Nevertheless, they noted some signs that the imbalance  of supply and demand in the labor market w as easing , with prime -age labor force participation returning to its pre -pandemic level a nd further reductions in the rates of job openings and quits."
" Participants anticipated  that employment growth wo uld likely slow further , reflecting a moderation in aggregate demand  coming partly from tighter credit conditions ."
" Participants remarked that al though nominal wage growth appeared to be slowing gradually, it was still running at a pace that, given curren t estimates of trend productivity growth, was well above  what would be consistent over Page 8Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________the longer run with the Committee’s 2 percent  inflation objective."
" Participants generally anticipated that under appropriate monetary policy, imbalances in the labor market would gradually diminish, easing pressures on wages and prices."
 Participants agreed that inflation was unacceptably high.
" They commented that data through March indicated that declines in inflation, particularly for  measures of core inflation, had been slower  than they had expected."
" P articipants observed  that although core goods inflation had moderated since the middle of last year, it had decelerated less  rapidly than expected  in recent months , despite reports fro m several business contacts of supply chain constraints continuing to ease."
" Additionally, participants emphasized that core nonhousing services inflation  had shown few signs of slowing in the past few months."
 Some participants remarked that a further eas ing in labor market conditions  would be needed to help bring down inflation in this component.
" Regarding housing services inflation, participants observed  that soft readings on rents for leases  signed by  new tenants were starting to feed into measured inflation."
 They expected  that this process would continue and would help lead to a decline in housing services inflation over this year.
" In discussing the likely effects on inflation of recent banking -sector developments, several participants remarked that tighter credit conditions may not put much downward pressure on inflation in part because lower credit availability could restrain aggregate supply as well as aggregate demand."
 Several participants noted that longer -term measures of inflation expectations from surveys of households and businesses remained well anchored.
" Participants emphasized that with appropriate firming of monetary policy, wellanchored longer -term inflation expectations would support a return of inflation to the Committee ’s 2 percent longer -run goal."
" Participants judged that risks to the outlook for economic activity were weighted to the downside , although a few noted the risks were two  sided ."
" In discussing sources of downside risk to economic activity, participants referenced the possibility that the cumulative tightening of monetary policy could affect economic activity more than expected , and that further strains in the banking sector could prove more substantial than anticipated ."
" Regarding risks to inflation, participants cited the possibility that price pressures could prove more persistent than anticipated because of , for example, stronger -thanexpected consumer spending and a tight labor market, especially if the effect  of bank stress on economic activity proved modest."
" However, a few participants cited the possibility that further tightening of credit conditi ons could slow household spending and reduce business investment and hiring, all of which would support the ongoing rebalancing of supply and demand in product and labor markets  and reduce inflation pressures ."
" These vulnerabilities included significant unrealized losses on assets  resulting from rising  interest rates, heavy reliance on uninsured deposits, or strained profitability amid higher funding costs."
" In their consideration of appropriate monetary policy actions at this meeting, participants c oncurred that inflation remained substantially elevated relative to the Committee’s longer -run goal of 2  percent ."
 Economic activity had expanded at a modest pace in the first quarter.
" The labor market continued to be tight, with robust job gains in recent months, and the unemployment rate remained low."
"  Participants also noted that recent developments in the banking sector would likely result in tighter credit conditions for households and businesses, which would weigh on economic activity, hiring, a nd inflation."
" In discussing the policy outlook, participants generally agreed that in light of the lagged effects of cumulative tightening in monetary policy and the potential effects on the economy of a further tightening in credit conditions, the extent to which additional increases in the target range may be appropriate after this meeting had become less certain ."
 Participants agreed  that it would be important to closely monitor incoming information and assess the implications for monetary policy.
" In determining the extent to which additional policy firming may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent  over time, various participants noted specific factors that should bear on future decisions on policy actions."
" One such factor was the degree and timing with which cumulative policy tightening restrained economic activity and reduced inflation, with some  participants commenting that they saw evidence that the past years’  tightening was beginning to hav e its intended effect."
" Another factor was the degree to which tighter credit conditions for households and businesses resulting from events in the banking sector would weigh  on activity and reduce inflation, which participants agreed was very uncertain."
" Additional factors included the progress toward returning inflation to the Committee’s longer -run goal of 2  percent , and the pace at which labor market conditions softened and economic growth slowed."
 A few assessed  that there were upside risks to economic growth .
" However, a lmost all participants commented that downside risks to growth and upside risks to unemployment had increased because of the possibility that banking -sector developments could lead to further tightening of credit conditions and weigh on economic activity."
" Almost all participants stated that, with inflation still well above the Committee’s longer -run goal and the labor market remaining tight, upside risks to the inflation outlook remained a key factor shaping the policy outlook ."
 A few pa rticipants noted that they also saw some downside r isks to inflation.
" Some  participants commented that, based on their expectations that progress in returning inflation to 2  percent  could continue to be unacceptably slow , additional policy firming would likely be warranted at future meetings."
"  In light of the prominent risks to the Committee’s objectives with respect to both maximum employment and price stability, participants generally noted the importance of closely monitoring incoming information and its implications for the economic outlook."
  Participa nts discussed the importance and various aspects of clearly explaining monetary policy actions and strategy.
 All participants reaffirmed their strong commitment to returning inflation to the Committee’s 2 percent  objective over time and remained highly attentive to inflation risks.
