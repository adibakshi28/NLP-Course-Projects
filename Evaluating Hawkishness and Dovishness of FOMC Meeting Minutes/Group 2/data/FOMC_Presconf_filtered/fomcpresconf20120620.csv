" Employment gains have been smaller in recent months , and the unemployment rate , at 8.2 percent , remains elevated ."
" In light of these developments, C ommittee participants have generally marked down their projections for economic growth, but most still see the economy as expanding at a moderate pace over coming quarters and then picking up gradually ."
"  Based on their projections for economic growth, FO MC participants foresee slower progress in reducing unemployment than they did in April ."
" Committee participants ’ projections for the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of this year have a central tendency of 8.0 to 8.2 percent, declining to 7.0 perce nt to 7.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 2014 , levels that would remain above participants ’ estimates of the longer -run normal rates of unemployment ."
" In addition to projecting only slow progress in bringing down unemployment, most participants see the risks to the outlook weighted mainly toward slower growth and higher unemployment ."

" Well, as I ’ve said many times, monetary policy is not a panacea."
 Monetary policy by itself is not going to solve our economic problems .

" Long -term interest rates, mortgage rates are already at historic lows ."

" So, it ’s not just the effect on the longterm interest rate, but there ’s a broader set of effects that feed through other a sset prices, other interest rates, other spreads, and provide a broader ease in financial conditions which is supportive to the economy."
" Unemployment is still too high , but it has come down."
 You told Congress earlier this month that the defining factor in your decision about whether to do more would be whether  unemployment was coming down.

economic growth.
" First of all, Europe is , if not in a recession in every country, certainly many countries are in recession, and that affects our trade with Europe and the demand for our products ."
" More br oadly, the effects of European concerns on financial markets have added to volatility, have brought down stock prices, have increased credit spreads, and generally have been a negative for economic growth ."
" And more broadly, we ’ve seen some slowing in global economic growth more generally , including in Asia , which also has reduced somewhat our ability to export ."
" I’m not criticizing that;  it’s just a fact, though, that these contract ions are affecting the pace of growth in the broader economy ."
" Given the environment that you’ ve sketched out and the fact that interest rates are at historically low points, would it make sense—would it be an option for t he government to issue more long -term debt at this point and take advantage of that?"
" June 20, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  14 of 22  Ther e’s a bit of an issue here , which is that what the Federal Reserve is doing with the program we announced today, the maturity extension p rogram , is we ’re taking longer -term debt off the market in order to induce investors to move into other assets  and to l ower longer -term interest rates ."
 Is there a rate of job growth you need to look —to see?
"  And also, if the unemployment rate comes down, is that enough?"
