 My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.
" We understand the hardship that high inflation is causing, and we remain strongly committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal."
" Since early l ast year, the FOMC has  significantly tightened  the stance of monetary policy."
" We have raised our policy interest rate by 5 percentage points , and we ’ve continued to reduce our securities holdings at a brisk pace."
" In light of how far we ’ve come in tightening policy, the uncertain lags with which monetary policy affects the economy, and potential headwinds from credit tightening, today we decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to reduce our securities holdings."
" Looking ahead, nearly all Committee participants view it as likely that some further rate increases will be appropriate this year to bring inflation down to 2 percent over time."
 A nd I will have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments.
" The U.S. economy slowed significantly last yea r, and r ecent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a modest pace ."
" Although growth in consumer spending has picked up this year, a ctivity in the housing sector remains weak, largely reflecting higher mortgage rates."
 Higher interest rates and slower output growth also appear to be weighing on business fixed investment.
" Committee partic ipants generally expect subdued June 14, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 2 of 26  growth to continue."
" In our Summary of Economic Projections, the median projection has real GDP growth at 1.0 percent this year and 1.1 percent next year, well below the median estimate of the longerrun normal growth rate."
 The unemployment rate moved up but rema ined low in May at 3.
 T here are some signs that supply and demand in the labor market are coming into better balance.
" Nominal wage growth has shown signs of easing, and job vacancies have declined so far this year."
" While the jobs -toworkers gap has declined , labor demand still substantially exceeds the supply of available workers."
" FOMC participants expect supply and demand condi tions in the labor market to come into better balance over time, easing upward pressures on inflation ."
 The median unemployment rate projection in the SEP rises to 4.1 percent at the end of this year and 4.5 percent at the end of next yea r.
Inflation remains well above our longerrun 2 percent goal.
  Inflation has moderated somewhat since the middle of last year.
" Nonetheless, inflation pressures continue to run high, and the process of getting inflation back down to 2 percent has a long way to go."
" The median projection in the SEP for total PCE inflation is 3.2 percent this year, 2.5 percent next year, and 2.1 percent in 2025."
" Core PCE inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, is projected to run higher than total inflation, and the median projection has been revised in the SEP up to 3.9 percent this year."
" Despite elevated inflation, longerterm inflation June 14, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 3 of 26   expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets."
 The Fed ’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and price —and stable prices for the A merican people.
" My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes hardship, as it erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation."
" We are highly attent ive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we ’re strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective."
" We have been seeing the effects of our policy tightening on demand in the most interest  rate–sensitive sectors of the economy, especially  housing and investment."
" It will take time, however, for the full effects of monetary restraint to be realized, especially o n inflation."
" The economy is fac ing headwinds from tighter credit conditions  for households and businesses, which are likely to weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation."
" In light of how far we ’ve come  in tightening policy, the uncertain lags with which monetary policy affects the economy, and potential headwinds from credit tightening, the Committee decided at today’ s meeting to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5 to 5¼ percent  and to continue the process of significantly reducing our securities holdings ."
"As I noted earlier, nearly , nearly all Committee participants expect that it will be appropriate to raise interest rates somewhat further by the end of the year."
" I n determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time, the Committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments."
" If the economy does not evolve as projected, the path for policy will adjust as appropriate to foster our  maximumemployment and price -stability goals."
" We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting, based on the totality of incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation , as well as the balance of risks ."
We remain committed to bring ing inflation —bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keep ing longer -term inflation expectations well anchored.
 Reducing inflation is likely to require a period of below -trend growth and some softening of labor  market conditions.
 Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run.
" June 14, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 5 of 26   We will do everything we can to achieve our maximum -employment and price -stability goals."
 I’m curious what gives you and the Committee the confidence that waiting will not be counterproductive at a time when the monthly pace of core inflation is still so elevated.
" Interest rate –sensitive sectors like housing, w hile they ’ve felt the drag of the past Fed actions, have started to recover in some regions , and financial conditions, you know, most recently were easing."
" The main issue that we’ re focused on now is determining the extent of additional poli cy firming that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time —so that the pace of the increases and the ultimate level of increases are separate variables, given how far it —we have come."
" I was just wondering if you could help us understand the, the narrative here because it feels like there’ s been a level shift in the —in the dots, stronger GDP, less of a hit to unemployment, slower progress on inflation."
" And I ’m wondering in, in this sort of —where ’s the disinflation coming from?"
 Demand ’s not coming down all that fast.
" A nd if you go back to the old —the former SEP—the last SEP in March, you will see that  [compared with March, projected real GDP] growth moved up."
" These are not huge moves, but growth estimates moved up a bit."
 Unemployment estimates move d down a bit .
 Inflation estimates moved up a bit.
" So your question is , where ’s the—where’s the disinflation going to come from?"
 We—the C ommittee has consistentl y said and believed that the process of getting inflation down is going to be a gradual one.
" And I think you go back to the —to the three -part framework for [analyzing] core PCE inflation —which is, we think, as good an indicator as you can have for where inflation is going forward."
" And that should enable goods prices to continue —goods, goods  inflation to continue to come down over time."
 In terms of housing services inflation —that ’s another big piece.
" In fact, I think any forecast that people are makin g right now about inflation coming down this year will , will  contain a big dose of —this year and June 14, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 8 of 26   next year —will contain a , a good amount of , of disinflation [com ing] from that source."
" That leaves, you know, the big sector, which is a little more than half , pardon me, of the—of core PCE inflation that ’s not housing services."
 And I think many analysts  would say that the key to getting inflation down there is to have a continuing loosening in labor market conditions —which we have seen.
" I would almost say that the, the conditions that we need to see in place to get inflation down are, are coming into place ."
 And that would be [real GDP] growth meaningfully below trend.
" There, there —the things are in place that we need to see, but the process of that actually working on inflation is going to take some time."
" With only one June employment —with only the June e mployment and the CPI report for June due to be released before the July meeting —you ge t the ECI after, you get the S enior L oan O fficer S urvey after , you get some June 14, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 10 of 26   bank earnings at the end of next month—w hat incremental information will the C ommittee be using to inform their judgment on whether this is , in fact, a skip or a , a longer pause?"
" You obviously, in your forecasts , marked up the sort of path for growth, mark ed down the path for unemployment , and marked up the path for inflation pretty notably."
" I wonder, you know , since March, what has changed to make you think that the economy’ s a lot more resilient and inflation is going to be a lot m ore stubborn?"
" You know, I, I would say again that I think that , over time, the balance of risks, as we move from very, you know —from interest rates that are effectively zero now to 5 percentage points with , with an SEP calling for additional hikes —I think we ’ve moved much closer to our destination, which is that sufficiently restrictive rate , and I think that means by—almost by def inition that the —that the risks of , of sort of overdoing it and under , June 14, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 12 of 26   underdoing it are , are getting closer to being in balance."
" I still think , and my, my colleagues agree, that, that the risks to inflation are to the upside still."
 So we don’ t—we don’ t think we ’re there with inflation yet because we ’re just looking at the data.
" And  if you look at the —at the full range of , of inflation data, particularly the core data, you just —you just aren’ t seeing a lot of progress over the last year."
" Headline,  of course, inflation has come down materially, but , as you know, we look at core [inflation] as a better indicator of where inflation overall is going ."
"Sufficiently —so I think, you know , what , what we ’d like to see is credible evidence that inflation is topping out and then beginning to come down."
" It’s, it’s sort of standard thinking that monetary policy affects economic activity with long and variable lags."
" So if you—if you look back when we were lifting off, we started talking about lifting off—by the time we had lifted off , the two -year [interest rate], which is a pretty good estimate of where [monetary] policy is going, had gone from 20 basis points to 200 basis points."
" But broader demand , and spending, and, and asset values, and things like that —they just take longer."
" I think we ’ll see it when we see inflation, you know, really, really flattening out reliably and then starting to soften."
" And , as you noted, a significant portion of core inflation is now housing prices."
" And forecasters, including Fed forecasters, have consistently thought that inflation was about to tu rn down and, you know, traditional— you know, typically  forecasted that it would and been wrong."
So I think if you—I think if you look at the —at core PC E inflation overall—look at it over the last six months —you’ re just not seeing a lot of progress.
" We’re, you know, of course, we ’re going to get inflation down to 2 percent  over time."
" But we have to get inflation down to 2 percent , and we will."
" I mean, the last press conference you mentioned you didn’ t see wages driving inflation."
" Can you give us a little more, specifically, of how you see the tight labor market driving inflation at this point?"
" So I ’m, I’m not going to comment on any particular paper, but I, I would say that the —I think the over all picture is that at the beginning in, you know, early 2021, inflation was really becoming from very strong demand for —largely for goods."
"And, of course, at the same time—and because of that high demand, to some extent, supply chains got all snarled up."
 Inflation went way up.
" B ut as you—as you moved into—through ’ 21, into ’22, and now in ’ 23, I think many, many analysts believe that it will be important—an important part of getting inflation down, especially in the nonhousing June 14, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 16 of 26   services sector, to getting wage inflation back to a level that is sustainable, that is consistent with 2 percent  inflation."
 You also said a number of times that it would take a while to bring inflation down.
" You reiterated that again today and that we, we’d get to a point where inflation could be sticky."
" In other words, if nothing much changes —if we ’re looking at the same sort of labor market, the same sort of inflation levels in July or in September or November—will you move because you’ ve said you feel you need to?"
" Is it time that’ s going to require additional movement , or would it be reversal in inflation?"
"Well, do you think inflation is likely to continue coming down based on the lags and based on your threat of additional movement?"
" So inflation is running —core PCE inflation is running at about 4½, a little higher than 4½ percent."
" W e’re, we’re committed to getting inflation down."
" We will, of course, continue to monitor conditions in money markets, and we ’re prepared to make adjustments to make sure that , that  monetary policy transmission works."
 Have you seen sufficient cooling in the housing market to bring inflation down?
" For example, how does the recent rebound affect your forecasts , and how does it fact or into monetary policy?"
" I do think we —we will see rents , rents and , and  house prices filtering into , into housing se rvices inflation."
 The CBO projects the federal deficit to be $2.8 trillion in 10 years.
 Because —assuming monetary policy cannot handle alone the inflation or keep that inflation in check with the higher -level spending.
" We—we  hope and expect that other policymakers will respect our independence on , on monetary policy."
" The unemployment rate, meanwhile, was pulled downward."
" I continue to think —and this really hasn ’t changed—that there is a path to getting inflation back down to 2 percent  without having to see the kind of sharp downturn and, and large losses of employment that we’ ve June 14, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 21 of 26   seen in so many past instances."
" We, we  see—the C ommittee —as you can see from the SEP, the C ommittee is completely unified in the need to get inflation down to 2 percent  and will do whatever it takes to get it down to 2 percent  over time."
" And, you know, we , we understand that allowing inflation to get entrenched into the —in the U .S."
" I’m just a little confused because you said the C ommittee will do whatever it takes to get in flation down over time , but when I look at the  SEP, inflation is still projected to be elevated next year, but the fed funds rate is lower than where it is now."
" But what they’ re showing is that as inflation comes down in the —in the forecast, if you don’ t lower interest rates, then real rates are actually going up, r ight?"
" So for us to get inflation down, t hat probably means —that, that certainly means that, that it will be appropriate to cut rates at such time as inflation is June 14, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 22 of 26   coming down really significantly."
 Inflation has not really moved down.
  The May job report showed a rebound in May in the B lack workers ’ unemployment.
 Is it consistent with the Fed ’s maximum -employment mandate?
" But we do conside r that when we ’re thinking about what constitutes maximum employment —it is, for us , a broad and inclusive goal."
" But remember, all unemployment, including Black unemployment, has been bouncing around right near historic lows —histo ric modern lows here."
" So overall unemployment of 3.7 percent i s, is higher —three -tenths  higher  than it was measured to be at the last —a month ago."
" We do need to see, you know , rents bottom out here or at least stay quite low in terms of their increases because we want —we want t he, you know, we want inflation to come down."
" What you see is—look at —look at core inflation over the past six months, a  year."
" And, you know, the C ommittee —people on the C ommittee —the median went up significantly, so that the median participant now thinks that core PC E inflation  on a 12 -month basis will be 3.9 percent this year."
" So we see that , and we see that inflation forecasts are coming in low again,  and we see that —that that tells us that we need to do more."
" Could you also talk briefly about your outlook for wages a nd, given the recent slowdown in core services excluding housing, how far you think w ages might need to fall in order to get inflation back in line ?"
" So we , we,  you know —what we’re talking about is having wage increases still at a very strong level but at a level that ’s June 14, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 24 of 26   consistent with 2 percent  inflation over time."
" But we want that as part of the process of getting inflation back down to 2 percent , which benefits everyone."
" I mean, inflation hurts those same people more than anyone else."
" People on a fixed income are hurt the worst , and the fastest , by high inflation."
" And, you know, we ’re making judgments about what it will take to get inflation down to 2 percent  in the aggregate."
" And it ’s becoming more about that as we —as we get into really servicesector inflation, which is the part of the economy where we have seen the least progress."
