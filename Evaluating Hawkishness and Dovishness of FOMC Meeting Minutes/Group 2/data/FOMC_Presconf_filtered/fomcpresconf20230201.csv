" My colleagues and I understand the hardship that high inflation is causing, and we are strongly committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal."
" Over the past year, we have taken forceful actions to tighten th e stance of monetary policy."
"Today, the FOMC  raised our  policy interest rate b y 25 basis  point s."
 We continue to anticipate that ongoing increases will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2  percent  over time .
 I will have more to say about today’s monetary policy actions after briefly reviewing economic develop ments.
 R ecent indicators point to modest growth of spending and production this quarter .
 Higher interest rates and slower output growth also appear to be weighing on business fixe d investment .
"Despite the slowdown in growth, the labor market remains extremely tight, with the unemployment rate at  a 50year low, job vacancies still very high, and wage growth elevated."
" February 1, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  Page 2 of 23  Job gains have been robust, with employment rising by an average of 247,000 jobs per month over the last three months ."
" Although t he pace of job gains has slowed over the course of the past year and nominal wage growth has shown some signs of easing, the labor market continues to be out of balance."
" Labor demand substantially exceed s the supply of available workers , and the labor force participation rate ha s change d little  from a year ago ."
Inflation remains well above our longerrun goal of 2 percent.
 The inflation data received over the past three months show a welcome reduction in the monthly pace of increases.
" And, while recent developments are encouraging, we will need substantially more evidence to be confident that inflation is on a sustained downward path."
"Despite elevat ed inflation, longerterm inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, a s well as measures from financial market s."
" Alth ough inflation has moderated recently, it remains too high."
" The longer the current bout of high inflation continues, the greater the chance that expectations of higher inflation will become entrenched ."
The Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our m andate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.
" My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship , as it erodes purchasing power , especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation."
" We are highly attentive to the risks that inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective."
 W e continue to anticipate that ongoing increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate  in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time.
" We are seeing the effects of our policy actions on demand in the most interest -sensitive sectors of the economy, particularly housi ng."
" It will take time, however, for the full effects of monetary restraint to be realized, especially on inflation."
" In light of the cumulative tightening of monetary policy  and the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation , the Committee decided to raise interest rates by 25 basis points today, continuing the stepdown from last year’s rapid pace of increases."
" We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting, taking into account the totality of incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation."
 We have been taking forceful steps to moderate demand so that it comes into better alignment with supply .
 Our overarching focus is using our tools to bring inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keep longer -term inflation expectations well anchored .
 Reducing inflation is likely to require a period of below -trend growth and some softening of labor market conditions.
" Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum February 1, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  Page 4 of 23   employment and st able prices over the longer  run."
 We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum -employment and price -stability goals.
 Does that make your job of combating inflation harder?
 So it is important that overall financial conditions continue to reflect the policy restraint that we ’re putting in place in order to bring inflation down to 2 percent .
" Over the last quarter, we ’ve seen a deceleration in prices, in wages, and a fall in consumer spending, all wh ile the unemployment rate has been able to stay at a historic low."
" Does this, at all, change your view of how much the unemployment rate would need to go up, if at all, to see inflation come down to the levels you ’re looking for?"
 So I would say it is a good thing that the disinflation that we have seen so far has not come at the expense of a weaker labor market.
  But I would also say that that disinflationary process that you now see under  way is really at an early stage.
"  What you see is, really , in the goods sector you see inflation now coming down because supply chains have been fixed, demand is shifting back to services, and shortages have been abated."
" In the other —in the housing services sector , we expect inflation to continue moving up for a while but then to come down, assuming that  [rent increases associated with]  new leases continue to be lower."
" The issue is that we have a large sector called nonhousing service—core nonhousing services, where we don’ t see dis inflation yet."
 Has your expectation for where the unemployment rate might go change d since December?
" I will say that it is gratifying to see the disinflationary process now February 1, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  Page 6 of 23   getting under  way, and we continue to get strong labor market data."
 That also coinci ded with slowdown in wage inflation.
 Do you believe that openings are an important indicator to be studying to understand where the labor market is and where wage inflation might be heading?
 What we did see—w e’ve seen average hourly earnings and now the employment cost index abating a little bit still off of their highs of six months ago and more but still at levels that are fairly elevated.
" So many, many—by many, many indicator s, the job market is still very strong."
"  We did, however, continue to say that we believe ongoing rate hikes will be appropriate to attain a sufficiently restrictive stance of policy to bring inflation back down to 2 percent ."
" Inflation springs back , and we have to go back in."
" But we , you know, if we feel like we ’ve gone too far, we can certainly —and inflation is coming down faster than we expect , then we have tools that would work on that."
" So I do think that , in this situation , where we have still the highest inflation in 40 years, you know, the job is not fully done."
" As I started to mention earlier, we have a sector that represents 56 percent  of the core inflation index where we don ’t see dis inflation yet."
 Inflation in the core services ex.
" In the other two sectors representing, you know, less than 50 percent,  you actually, I think, now have a story that is credible, that’ s coming together, although you don’ t actually  see dis inflation yet in housing services, but it ’s in the pipeline, right?"
" We n eed to see —our goal, of course, is to bring inflation down."
" There are many , many factors driving inflation in that sector, and they should be coming into play to have inflation—the disinflationary process begin in that sector."
 You ’re saying inflation has eased  T hat’s new.
" We can now say, I think, for the first time that the disinflationary process has started."
" We—you know, it ’s supply chains, it ’s shortages, and it ’s demand revolving back towards services."
" And we —as I mentioned , with housing services, we  expect , and other forecasters expect , that measured inflation will continue moving up for several months but will then come down , assuming that  [rent increases associated with]  new leases continue to be soft."
" And we actually see disinflation in the goods sector , and we see it in the pipeline for two sectors that amount to a little less than half."
 And we note that when we say inflation is coming down that this is good.
" We expect to see that that disinflation process will be seen, we hope soon, in the core goods ex."
"  In any case, we don’ t see dis inflation in that sector yet."
 We’re just telling you that we don’ t see inflation moving down yet in that large sector.
" Until we do, I think we —you know, we see ourselves, we ’ve got to be honest with ourselves , but w e see ourselves as having perhaps more persistent —we’ll see more persistent inflation in that sector, which will take longer to get down."
" Chair Powell, you observed several years ago that we learned we can have a low unemployment rate without above -target inflation."
 And we have learned lately that inflation can come down from its uncomfortably high level despite a historically low unemployment rate.
"  We think, because inflation is still running very hot ."
" It really —the story we ’re telling about inflation is to ourselves , and the way we understand it is basically the three things that I’ ve just gone through a couple of times."
 We’ re going to be carefully watching the economy and watching inflation and watching the progress of the disinflationary process.
 And we said that we continue to anticipate that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate in order to attain that stance of sufficiently restrictive monetary policy that will bring inflation down to 2 percent .
" Mr. Chairman, the S EP has the P CE inflation rate in 2023 at 3.1 percent ."
" And you’ ve also achieved it witho ut the 1 percentage point increase in the unemployment rate, which you have penciled in for this year."
" I ’m wondering if you’ ve considered the idea of whether or not your understanding of the inflation dynamic may be wrong, and it ’s possible to achieve these things without raising rates that high and also without the surge in unemployment."
 The idea that it may not require unemployment rising to get this sector of inflation under control.
" First, on the forecast, if—you’ re right—i f you take very short -term three -month, say, measures of PCE —core PCE inflation, they ’re quite low right now."
" But that ’s because that ’s driven by, you know, significantly negative readings from goods inflation."
" Most forecasters would think that the significantly negative readings will be transitory and that goods inflation will move up fairly soon, back up to its longer -run trend of something around zero, something like that."
" You know, let ’s say inflation does come down much faster than we expect, which is possible."
 So there are lots of things in that mix that will drive inflation.
" I would say overall, though, my own view would be that you ’re not going to have, you know, a sustainable return to 2 percent  inflation in that sector without a better balance in the labor market."
" And I don’ t know what that will require in terms of increased unemployment, your question."
" And so far , we’ve got —as I mentioned, in goods , we have inflation moving down without the softening in the labor market."
  I think most forecasters would say that unemployment will probably rise a bit from here.
  But I still think —I continue to think that there ’s a path to getting inflation back down to 2 percent  without a really significant economic decline or a significant increase in unemployment.
" The inflation that we originally got was very much a collision between very strong demand and hard supply constraints, not something that you really have seen in prior —you know, in prior business cycles."
" And so now we see goods inflation coming down for the reasons we thought, and we understand why housing inflation will come down."
" But I think there is —there’s ongoing disinflation , and we don’ t yet see weakening in the labor market."
" It may well be that as —yeah, as —that it will take more slowing than we expect —than I expect to get inflation down to 2  percent ."
 My bas e case is that the economy can return to 2  percent  inflation without a really significant downturn or a really big increase in unemployment.
" I ’d like to pick up on what you were just saying about a substantial downturn and ask, with the full weight of your tightening not in place yet and with the progress against inflation, there ’s still a lot of talk about very, very slow growth going forward in 2023."
" So I ’m wondering if you’ ve changed your view or you have a more nuanced view of what you think the danger to economic growth is going forward and whether you’ re very close to perhaps tipping it into the wrong place, which calls for more restraint on your part."
" So I do think you—most forecast s and, you know, my own assessment would be that that growth will continue —positive growth will continue but at a subdued pace as it did last year."
" We had growth of —GDP growth of 1 per cent last year and also final sales growth, which we think is a better indicator , of about 1  percent ."
" I think, you know, most forecasts and certainly my assessment would be that growth will continue at a fairly subdued level this year."
" As inflation does come  down, sentiment will improve."
 And so that ’s going to support economic activity.
 So I think there ’s a good chance that those factors will help support positive growth this year.
" And that ’s my base case , is that there will be positive growth this year."
" Second off, I think, earlier on in the press conference, you said you need to see substantially more evidence of inflation coming down."
" And so  is it just the inflation data , or do you have to see the labor market coming back into better balance to have that “ substantially more evidence ” metric ?"
" So, of course, we ’ll be looking —by the time of the March meeting, we’ll have two more employment reports, two more CPI reports, and we ’ll be looking at those carefully as all of us will."
"  But I will say, though, we —you know, it is our job to restore price stability and achieve 2 percent  inflation for the benefit of the American public."
" And so we are strongly resolved that we will, you know, complete this task because we think it has benefits that will, you know, support economic activity and benefit the public for many, many years."
 So you’ ve talked about we had solid job growth.
" We had solid job growth, a slight falling in the increase in consumer spending."
 It seems so far it ’s been relatively mild from the economy to go to —from a 9.1 percent  CPI inflation to 6.5  percent  CPI inflation.
" You know, the —so we, of course, expected goods inflation to start coming down by the end of 2021, and it didn’ t come down all through ’ 22."
 Inflation —it’s just harder to forecast inflation.
" And, you know, our job is to deliver inflation back to target , and we will do that."
 It’ s just —it’s the early stages of disinflation.
"  And it ’s most welcome to be able to say that we are now in disinflation, but that ’s great."
" You know, so—a gain, my forecast and that of my colleagues as you will see from the S EP and —I mean, there are many different forecasts, but , generally, it ’s a forecast of slower growth, some softening in labor market conditions, and inflation moving down steadily but not quickly."
" You know, if that happens —inflation comes down much faster, you know, then we ’ll be seeing that , and it will be incorporated into our thinking about policy."
"  I’m not particularly concerned about the divergence, no, because it is largely due to the market ’s expectation that inflation will move down more quickly."
" So, again, as I just mentioned, we —you know, our forecasts —different participants have  differe nt forecasts, but , generally, those forecasts are for continued subdued growth, some softening in the labor market but not a recession, not a recession."
" And we have inflation moving down, you know, into th e—somewhere in the mid -threes or maybe lower than that this year."
" They show inflation coming down, in some cases, much quicker than that."
" If we do see inflation coming down much more quickly, that ’ll play into our policy s etting , of course."
" That means that , effectively, in people ’s decisionmaking, inflation has become a really salient issue."
" And, you know, so that ’s why we worry that the longer we’re at this and the longer people are talking about  inflation all day long, every day, you know, the more risk of something like that."
" And I ’ve seen some data, too, that show people are, you know, gradually—they’ re glad that inflation is coming down."
 People really don’ t like inflation.
" And as we see it coming down, that could also add a boost to economic activity."
" You look at the sentiment surveys now, and they’ re very, very low with 3½ percent unemployment and, you know, high wage increases nominally by historical standards."
" It has to be inflation, right?"
" That ’s at the very heart, is consumers and businesses that, you know, are the—essentially, we believe that expectations of future inflation are a very important part of the process of creating inflation."
" And , in this case, I would say , the risk eight months ago or so, longer -term inflation expectations had moved up."
" I think, you know, the markets have decided, and the public has decided, that inflation is going to come back down to 2 percent  and it’ s just a matter of us following through ."
 That's immeasurably helpful to the process of getting inflation down.
" In the minutes of the December meeting, there was a couple of sentences that struck people as important , when the C ommittee said participants talked about this unwarranted easing of financial conditions was a risk and it would make your life harder to bring inflation down."
" As we ’ve discussed a couple times here, there ’s a difference in perspective b y some market measures on how fast inflation will come down."
" And I think the answer is, basically, I don’ t think there ’s likely to be any important interaction between the two, because I believe Congress will wind up acting , and—as it will and must, in the end, to raise the debt ceiling in a way that doesn’ t risk, you know, the progress we ’re making against inflation and the economy and the financial sector."
