 Earlier t oday  the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) approved new measures to support  the recovery and employment  growth .
"  As you know, the Federal Reserve conducts  monetary policy under a dual mandate  from  Congress  to promote maximum employment and price stability."
" While the economy appears to be on a path of moderate recovery, it isn’t  growing fast enough to make significant  progress reducing  the unemployment rate."
" And, at  8.1 percent, the unemployment rate is nearly unchanged since the beginning of the year and is well above normal levels."
  The weak job market should concern every American.
" High unemployment imposes hardship on millions of people, and it entails  a tremendous  waste of human skills and talents ."
" With our main policy interest September 13, 2012    Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL 2 of 25 rate near its effective lower bound, we have been using two complementary tools to carry out monetary policy —balance sheet actions and forward guidance regarding how long we anticipate maintaining ex ception al levels of policy accommodation."
" While providing this support, we  have been prudent, carefully weighing the potential benefits and costs of each new policy action, and recognizing that monetary policy, particularly in the current circumstances, cannot cure all economic ills."
"  However, incoming  data confirm that the modest pace of growth continues to be inadequa te to generate much progress on unemployment."
" W ith inflation anticipated to run at or below our 2 percent objective, the Committee has  become convinced that further policy accommodation is warranted to strengthen the recovery and support the gains we have begun to see in housing and other sectors."
" The program of MBS purchases should increase the downward pressure on long -term interest rates more September 13, 2012    Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL 3 of 25 generally, but also on mortgage rates , specifically, which should provide further support for the housing sector by encouraging home purchases and refinancing."
 We will be looking for the sort of broad -based growth in jobs and economic activity that generally signal sustained improvement in labor market conditions and declining unemployment.
" Of course , in determining the size, pace, and composition of any additional asset purchases, we will, as always, take appropriate account of the inflation outlook and of their efficacy and costs."
"  Additionally, the Committee  emphasized that it expects a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy to remain appropriate for a considerable time after the economic recovery strengthens."
" Committee participants’  projections for the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of t his year have a central tendency of 8.0 to 8.2 percent, declining to 6.0 to 6.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2015, levels that September 13, 2012    Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL 4 of 25 remain  somewhat above participants’  estimates of the longer -run normal rate of unemployment."
 Participants’  projections of inflation have a central tendency of 1.7 percent to 1.8 percent for this year and 1.8 percent to 2.0 percent for 2015.
"Before I take your questions , I’d like to briefly address three concerns that have  been  raised about the Federal Reserve’s  accommodative monetary policy."
 The third is that the Federal Reserve’s  policies risk inflation down the road.
"  But low interest rates also support the value of many other assets that Americans own, such as homes and businesses  large and small."
" Thus, while low interest rates do impose some costs, Americans will ultimately benefit most from the healthy and growing economy that low interest rates help promote."
"And f inally, on inflation:  Inflation  has varied in recent years with swings in global foo d and fuel prices caused by a range of factors, such as drought and geopolitical tensions."
" However, overall inflation has averaged very close to the Committee’s  goal of 2 percent  per year for quite a few years now, and a variety of measures show that longer -term inflation expectations are quite stable."
 The Federal Reserve is fully committed to both sides of its mandate—to  price stability as well as to maximum employment—and it has both the tools and the will to act at the appropriate time to avoid any emergin g threat to price stability.
" Your forecast doesn ’t get back to full employment for four years, so could these new bond purchases go on for years?"
 We ’ll be looking for signs that the economy is strong enough to prom ote improvement and sustained improvement in labor market conditions and declines in unemployment.
" I mean, that ’s—we ’re not going to be able to sustain purchases until September 13, 2012    Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL 6 of 25 we’re all the way back to full employment, that’ s not the objective ."
" The idea is to qu icken the recovery , to help the economy begin to grow quickly enough to generate new jobs and reduce the unemployment rate ."
" E ven after the economy starts to recover more quickly, even after the unemployment  rate begins to move down more decisively, we ’re not going to rush to begin to tighten policy ."
" Does that mean that your tolerance for inflation will be higher in coming years , in the middle of the recovery?"
" And , if not, what good is that language there if it doesn’ t tell people that the reaction function relative to inflation has changed?"
" Well , our policy approa ch doesn ’t involve intentionally trying to raise inflation ."
 The idea is to make su re we provide enough support so the economy will grow fast enough to bring unemployment down over time .
" I mean, September 13, 2012    Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL 7 of 25 as we look back at the last six m onths or so, we ’ve seen unemployment at basically the same place it was in January ."
" We’ve seen not enough jobs growth to bring down the unemployment rate, and what we need to see is more progress ."
" But if you look at our projections, you’ ll see it doesn ’t involve any inflation , that we still believe that inflation is going to be close to our 2 percent target."
" Does this —so you ’re saying it does not include greater tolerance for inflation , that you will— you would reverse course if inflation were to  be above your target level, even given that statement?"
" Well, if inflation goes above the target level, as we talked about in our statement in January, we take a balanced approach ."
" We bring inflation back to the target over time , but w e do it in a way that takes into account the deviations of both of our objectives, you know, from their targets ."
4 reduction in unemployment .
" Well , our assessment —I talked about this at my remarks at Jackson Hole —our assessment , and that of the research literature, is that the polic ies that we ’ve undertaken have had real benefits for the economy —that they have provided some support, that they have eased financial conditions and help reduce unemployment ."
" All tha t being said, September 13, 2012    Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL 8 of 25 monetary policy, as I ’ve said many times, is not a panacea."
" We’ll do our part , and we’ll try to make sure that unemployment moves  in the right direction , but we can ’t solve this problem by ourselves."
 We don’ t have tools that are strong enough to solve the unemployment problem.
" Can you give us an idea of how much you think it might push rates down, a nd why moving r ates down a few basis points might change demand, which seems to be the problem in the economy?"
" We do  think that these policies can  bring interest rates down—not just Treasury rates , but a whole range of rates, including mortgage rates and rates for corporate bonds and other types of important interest rates ."
" We ’re just  trying to get the economy  moving in the right direction , to make sure that we don ’t stagnate at high levels of unemployment, that we ’re making progress toward s more acceptable l evels of unemployment."
" If the unemployment situation doesn’ t improve , then what other measures  do you have available?"
" We are trying to create more employment , we are trying to meet our maximum employment mandate, so that ’s the objective ."
" Our tools involve —I mean , the to ols we have involve affecting financial asset prices , and that ’s—those are the tools of monetary policy ."
" There are a number of different channels —mortgage rates, I mentioned other interest rates, corporate bond rates, but also the prices of various assets, like , for example, the prices of homes ."
" One of the main concerns that firms have is there is not enough demand, there ’s not enough people coming and demanding their products ."
" And if people feel that their financial September 13, 2012    Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL 11 of 25 situation is better because their 401(k) looks better  or for whatever reason, their house is worth more, they are more willing to go out and spend, and that ’s going to provide the demand that firms need in order to be willing to hire and to invest."
" We’re looking for something that involves unemployment coming down in a sustained way, not necessarily a rapid way , because I don ’t know if our tools are that strong, but we ’d like to see an economy which is strong enough that it will support improving labor market conditions and unemployment that ’s declining gradually over time ."
" We want to see the unemployment rate come down, but that ’s not the only indicator, obviously, of labor market conditions ."
 The u nemployment rate came down last month because participation fell .
 We want to see lower unemployment .
" Mr. Chairman, one of the innovations of your statement today is that you have for the first time explicitly predicated your monetary policy action on the achievement of explicit economic goals , in this case a substantial improvement in the labor market ."
" In particular , what ’s the state of the labor market, what ’s the state of the outlook for economic growth?"
" Sir , just to follow  up on—Peter Barnes with Fox Business —to follow up on Darren’ s questions, a question about getting back to full employment ."
" You said that you can’ t cure all ills, that you haven ’t got strong enough tools to deal with the unemployment problem ."
" The CBO has suggeste d that  if that’s allowed to take place, that it would cause unemployment to begin to rise , and it might throw the economy back into recession."
" So I think one very basic thing that could be done to help address the recovery —the weakness of the recovery and the need  for more employment —would be to address the fiscal clif f while simultaneously addressing longer -term fiscal sustainability issues which remain, of course, very serious ."
" In the economic and inflation projections , you foresee a low inflation r ate below 2 percent to 2015—not  you personally , but the FOMC ."
" I am wondering , if you look at the growth rate s, you have growth rates of about 3.4 perc entage points in 2014 and 2015."
" How long September 13, 2012    Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL 19 of 25 do you think that it might work that you have such strong growth and no inflation pressur e?"
" Well, the—on inflation, we do anticipate at some point what ’s normal in a recovery, which is , given that the economy fell very quickly and there ’s a lo t of unused capacity, there ’s a lot of slack in the economy, it would be normal that there would be a peri od where the economy would grow faster than trend in order to make up some of the slack that was created ."
" And as long as we pay close attention to inflation expectations as well as the trajectory of the economy, we think inflation will remain close to our 2 percent target ."
" Our job is to use the tools we have to meet our mandate, which is maximum employment and price stability ."
" But, you know, that ’s not our province;  we are the monetary policy authorit ies, and our job is to use monetary policy as effectively  as we can."
" I am particularly struck by the statement that “ the C ommittee expects that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the economic recovery strengthens .”  I assume that was done to make your forward guidance more credible, and yet the question remains whether, you know, as the economy picks up steam, whether the FOMC will really follow through and keep rates lo w or whether you will do as the Fed has always done and begin to raise the funds rate."
" Michael Woodford— who, by the way, is my former colleague and coauthor and friend, so I know him quite well , and  I know his works quite well —I think, actually, the thrust of his research is that forward guidance—communication about future policy —is, in fact , the most powerful tool that central banks have when the interest rate is close to zero ."
" And he advocates pol icies like nominal GDP targeting , for example, that would essentially require credibility lasting many years , the implication being that the Fed would target the nominal level of GDP  and promise to do that for many years in the future even if inflation, you know, rose as part of that policy ."
" And the evidence , which I also , again , discussed in my remarks recently , is that when we ’ve announced extended guidance , that financial markets have September 13, 2012    Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL 21 of 25 responded to that, that private -sector forecasters have changed their estimates of what unemployment and inflation will be when the Fed begins to remove accommodation."
" Well, again , as I mentioned before , it’s true that our mortgage -back ed securities purchases ought to drive down mortgage rates, and put downward pressure on mortgage rates , and create more demand for homes and more refinancing ."
 How much is that fear contributing t o lack  of—lack of growth or adequate GDP growth in the economy?
" And, as I talked about in a speech in March , in order for employment gains to be sustaine d, for unemployment to fall, the economy needs to grow at or above trend levels."
" So we ’ve been responding to that problem and trying to take steps that will assure somewhat stronger growth and, we hope , will help  bring unemployment down over time ."
 One of the aspects we’ve seen in recent reports on unemployment is the shrinking labor force .
 They might even temporarily raise the unemployment rate because they ’re now looking again.
" And it’s why I said ea rlier that we do want to look at a range of indicators, not just the unemployment rate , although that ’s a very important indicator , not just payrolls , although that also is a leading indicator , but participation, hours, part -time work , and a variety of other measures which suggest that our labor market is still in quite weak condition."
