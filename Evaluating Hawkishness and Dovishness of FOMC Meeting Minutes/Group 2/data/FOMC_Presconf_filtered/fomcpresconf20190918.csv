 We do this by steadfastly       pursuing the goals Congress has given us :  maximum employment and stable prices.
 To day we decided to lower interest rates.
" H ousehold spending—support ed by a strong job market, rising incomes, and solid con sumer confidence —has been the key driver of growth."
 The main reasons appear to be slower growth abroad and trade policy developments —two sources of uncertainty that we ’ve been monitoring all year.
" Since the middle of last year, the global growth outlook has weakened , notably in Europe and China."
" September 18, 2019   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 2 of 26  As seen from FOMC participants ’ most recent projections , the median expectation for real GDP  growth remains near 2 percent this year and next before edging down toward its estimated longer -run value."
 The job market remains strong .
" The unemployment rate has been near half -century lows  for a year and a half, and  job gains have remain ed solid in recent months."
" This underscores , for us , the importance of sustaining the expansion so that the strong job market reaches more of those left behind."
 We expect the job market to remain strong .
 The m edian of participants’ projections for the unemployment rate remains below 4 percent over the next several years.
 Inflation continues to run below our symmetric 2 percent objective.
" Over the 12 months through July, t otal PCE inflation was 1.4 percent and core inflation , which excludes volatile food and energy prices, w as 1.6 percent."
" We still expect inflation to rise to 2 percent; the median projection is 1.9 percent this year and 2 percent in 2021.1  However, inflation pressures clearly remain muted, and indicators of longer -term inflation expectations are at the lower end of their historical ranges."
 We are mindful that continued below -target inflation could lead to an unwelcome downward slide in longer -term inflation expectations.
" Overall, as we say in our postmeeting statement, we continue to see sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near our symmetric 2 percent                                                  1 Chair Powell intended to say that the median projection is 1.9 percent next year."
" While this has been our outlook for quite some time , our views about the path of interest rates that will best achieve these outcomes have changed significantly over the past year."
" As I mentioned, weakness in global growth and trade policy uncertainty have weighed on the economy and pose ongoing risks ."
" These factors, i n conjunction with muted  inflation pressures , have led us to shift our views about appropriate monetary policy over time toward a lower path for the federal funds rate , and this shift has supported the outlook."
" Of course, this is the role of monetary poli cy—to adjust interest rates to maintain a strong labor market and keep inflation near our 2 percent objective."
" Today’s decision to lower the federal funds rate target by ¼ percent , to 1.75  percent to 2 percent , is appropriate in light of the global developments I mentioned as well as muted inflation pressures."
" The Fed has no role in the for mulation of trade policy, but we do take  into account anything that could materially affect the economy relative to our employment and inflation goals."
 The future course of monetary policy will depend on how the economy evolves and what developments imply for the economic outlook and risks to the outlook.
Let me say a few words about  our monetary policy operations.
" While these issues are important for market functioning and market partici pants, they  have no implications for the economy or the stance of monetary policy."
" In addition, as w e have done in the past, we made a technical adjustment to the interest rate paid on required and excess reserve balances, setting it 20 basis points below the top of the target range for the federal funds rate."
" Consistent with our decision earlier this year to continue to implement monetary policy in an ample -reserves regime, we will, over time, provide a sufficient supply of reserves so that frequent operations are not required."
"  To summarize, we are fully committed to pursuing our goals of maximum employment and stable prices."
" As the Committee contemplates the future path of the target range for the federal funds rate, it will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the econ omic outlook and will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion, with a strong labor market and inflation near its symmetric 2  percent objective."
" So, as you can see from our policy statement and from the SEP, we see a favorable economic outlook, with continued moderate growth, a strong labor market, and inflation near our 2 percent objective ."
" As our statement also highlights , though, there are risks to this positive outlook due particularly to weak global growth and trade developments ."
" We’ve seen —you know, if you look at the things we ’re monitoring, particularly global growth and trade development s, global growth has continued to weaken ."
" So I told you where  the C ommittee —the bulk of the Committee is going , meeting by meeting, and I think the main takeaway is that this is a C ommittee that has shifted its policy stance repeatedly, September 18, 2019   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 8 of 26  consistently , through the course of the year to support economic activity as it has  felt that it ’s appropriate ."
" The strains in the money markets reflect forces that we saw coming, and they just had a bigger effect than I think most folks anticipated —strong demand for cash to purchase T reasuries and pay corporate taxes."
" Earlier in the year, as you will all recall, after careful study over a period of years, actually, the C ommittee announced the decision to implement monetary policy in an ample -reserves regime."
 The main hallmark of that regime is that we use adjustments in our administered rates— the IOER and RRP rates—to keep the fed fund rates in the target range.
" So, going forward, we ’re going to be very closely monitoring market developments and assessing their implications for the appropriate level of reserves, and we’ re going to be assessing, you know, the question of when it will be appropriate to resume the organi c growth of our balance sheet ."
" And as you know, we ’ve invested lots of time talking to many of the large holde rs of reserves to assess their —what they say is their demand for reserves."
" But , yes, there ’s real uncertainty, and it is certainly possible that we will need to resume the organic growth of the balance sheet earlier than we thought ."
 A nd it suggested that it could drag through the busine ss investment channel on growth as much as a percentage point over the course of the next year .
" You talked about the C ommittee thinking about September 18, 2019   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 13 of 26  resuming organic growth, you know, over time ."
" I guess the question is, if you have shrunk your balance sheet maybe just a little bit too small to the point that reserves are too scarce to get through sort of these unusual periods, is organic growth in the balance sheet enough to get back to a point of ample reserves that can get us through those tough times , or would you need to see something a little b it above that ?"
 About a month ago or so you said that there ’s no precedent to integrate trade uncertainty in to monetary policy.
" In the last few weeks, have you figured out how to incorporate trade uncertainty —and this level of trade uncertainty —into monetary policy going forward ?"
" We ’re talking about it because anything tha t affects the achievement of our  goals can , in principle , be something that monetary policy should take into consideration."
" But we do have a very powerful tool which can counteract weakness , to some extent , by supporting demand through sound monetary policy."
" A nd we think our policy tools support economic activity through fairly well -understood channels :  by reducing interest September 18, 2019   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 15 of 26  burden and encouraging consumer purchase of durables , of homes , and other interestsensitive items ; by creating broadly more accommodative financial conditions, which support spending and also investment by businesses ; and also by boosting household and business confidence ."
 We’re supposed to be reacting on behalf of the American economy to support maximum employment and stable prices.
" So what we are looking for through all of the data, all the events that are going on around the world, we ’ll be looking at, you know, the evolving geopolitical events , we’ll be looking at global growth, w e’ll be looking at trade policy uncertainty."
"economy, particularly the outlook as it relates to maximum employment and stab le prices."
" But , overall, you see an economy that —I think , generally , forecasts show  growth similar to our own, forecasts coming in about 2 percent, which is a good, solid year."
" So the difference here is, we have significant , really , risks to that outlook from not just the geopolitical events , but also from slowing global growth and tra de policy uncertainty."
 You mentioned negative interest rates.
 So negative interest rates is some thing that we looked at during the financial crisis and chose not to do.
" We chose to —after we got to the effective lower bound, we chose to do a lot of aggressive forward guidance and also large -scale asset purchases, and those were the two unconventional  monetary policy tools that we used extensively."
" By the way, we are in the middle of a monetary policy re view where we ’re looking through all of these questions about the longer -run framework —the strategy , tools , and communications —and we expect that to be completed sometime around the middle of next year."
" So, in terms of how our rate cuts will affect the real economy, first, we th ink monetary policy works with, as Friedman said , long and variable lags."
" But, you know, we think that l ower interest rates will reduce  interest burden for borrowers , so that interest -sensitive things like housing and durable goods and other things like that —cars —it supports purchases of those."
" So I think, through all of those channels , monetary policy works."
" We ’ll—we’ll us e our tools to offset negative —that’s really the job of monetary policy, is, to the extent it can, to offset, you know, things that drive us away from maximum employment and stable prices."
" Chair Powell, are you worried that the low interest rates are adding to , or could create a bubble of , September 18, 2019   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 19 of 26  consumer and corporate debt that could make it more difficult for , especially , consumers to recover from the next recession or survive the next recession?"
" So is the economy over  the next year —between now and the end of next year , do you think GDP growth is going to hold s teady , and the unemployment rate —could you talk about , just , how do you see the economy evolving over the next year?"
" You know, so, I think— and my colleagues and I , I think, all think that the most likely case is for continued moderate growth, continued strong labor market, and inflation moving back up to 2 percent."
" It ’s that global growth will have an effect on U.S. growth over time — less so than for many other economies, but , still, there ’s a sector of our economy that ’s exposed to that."
" But , nonetheless —so the job of monetary policy is to adjust both to e nsure against  those downside risks , but also to support the economy in light of the existing weakness that we do see."
" But we are adjusting monetary policy in a more accommodative direction to try to support what is , in fact , a favorable outlook."
" There are a number —there can be a signal about expectations about growth there for sure, but there can also just be low  term premiums."
" Nonetheless, that is a signal about weak global growth, probably, and weak global growth would affect us."
 What is your rule for stopping as far as interest rate cuts go?
" The Fed and your fellow central banks have been sort of exploring the far reaches of what ’s possible for monetary policy, even going so far as to make rates negative in some cases, with mixed results."
" As you and your col leagues do this monetary policy framework review, do you ever consider the limitations of monetary policy?"
 Should you be more explicit about what monetary policy can and cannot do in this environment?
" You know, we try to be clear about that , but, really, I think our job is to use our tools as best we can to achieve—you know , to do the jobs that Congress has assigned us, which is achieve maximum employment and stable prices."
" A nd, at a high level, yes, I would say, and I ’ve said before, that it ’s really fiscal policy that is more powerful and that has muc h more to do with—fiscal policy can do those things that will increase the longer -run growth rate of the United States by improving productivity and labor force September 18, 2019   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 24 of 26  participation and the skills and aptitudes of workers."
" Over the long run, we can’ t really affect the growth rate of the United States ."
 The potential growth rate of the United States  is not a function of monetary policy.
 A nd I assu re you that my colleagues and I will continue to conduct monetary policy without regard to political considerations.
" As we saw with falling yields , at least up until the beginning of this month, there ’s been a lot of demand for U.S. Treasuries, and even that was  partly maybe to blame for the liquidity crunch in  repo markets that we saw this week."
" That’s really —that ’s really Treasury ’s job and Congress ’s job, in terms of, well, there ’s how much to spend, and how big the deficits are , and then there ’s how to finance it."
" Mr. Chairman, in your view, is there any risk to the United States having much higher interest rates than Europe  and Japan and other parts of the world?"
" And, you know, the way I would characterize it is this :  that low rates abroad are a symbol —or a sign, rather, of weak global growth, e xpectations of low inflation, low growth, and, you know, just kind of a lack of policy space to move against or ideas about how to break out of that low equilibrium."
 We take that into account in setting our interest rate policy.
