 My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.
" Inflation has eased from its highs, and this has come without a significant increase in unemployment."
" But inflation is still too high, ongoing progress in bringing it down is not assured, and the path forward is uncertain."
" As we look ahead to next year, I want to assure the American people that we’ re fully committed to returning inflation to our 2 pe rcent goal."
" Since early last year, the FOMC has significantly tightened the stance of monetary policy."
 We ’ve raised our policy interest rate by 5¼ percentage points and have continued to reduce our securities holdings at a brisk pace.
" Our actions have moved our policy rate well into restrictive territory, meaning that tight policy is putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation, and the full effects of our tightening likely have not yet been felt."
" Today, we decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to reduce our securities holdings."
 I will have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewi ng economic developments.
 Recent indicators suggest that growth of economic activity has slowed substantially from the outsized pace seen in the third quarter.
" Even so, GDP is on track to expand around December 13 , 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 2 of 24   2½ percent for the year as a whole, bolstered by strong consumer demand as well as improving supply conditions."
 Higher interest rates also appear to be weighing on business fixed investment.
" In our Summary of Economic Projections  (SEP) , Committee participants revised up their assessments of GDP growth this year but expect growth to cool, with the median projection falling to 1.4 percent next year."
" The labor market remains tight, but supply and demand conditions continue to come into better balance."
 The unemployment rate remains low at 3.7  percent.
" Nominal wage growth appears to be easing, and job vacancies have declined."
" Although the jobs -toworkers gap has narrowed, labor demand still exceeds the supply of available workers."
" FOMC participants expect the rebalancing in the labor market to continue, easing upward pressures on inflation."
 The median unemployment rate projection in the SEP rises somewhat from 3.8 percent at the end of this year to 4.1 percent at the end of next year.
 Inflation has eased over the past year but remains above our longer -run goal of 2 percent.
" December 13 , 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 3 of 24   The lower inflation readings over the past several months are welcome, but we will need to see further evidence to build confidence that inflation is moving down sustainably toward our goal."
" Longer -term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets."
" As is evident from the SEP, we anticipate that the process of getting inflation all the way to 2 percent will take some time."
 The Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.
" My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship , as it erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation."
" We are highly , highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are strongly committed to returning inf lation to our 2 percent objective."
 Our restrictive stance of monetary policy is putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation.
" While we believe that our policy rate is likely at or near its peak for this tightening cycle, the economy has surprised forecasters in many ways since the pandemic, and ongoing progress —sorry —ongoing progress  toward our 2  percent inflation objective is not assured."
" We ’re committed to achieving a stance of December 13 , 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 4 of 24   monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation sustainably down to 2  percent over time and to keeping policy restrictive until we ’re confident that inflation is on a path to that objective."
" While participants do not view it as likely to be appropriate to raise interest rates further, neither do they want to take the possibility off the table."
" These projections are not a Committee decision or plan; if the economy does not evolve as projected, the path of  policy will adjust as appropriate to foster our maximum -employment and price -stability goals."
" We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting, based on the totality of the incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation , as well as the balance of risks."
" In determining the extent of any additional policy firming that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2  percent over time, the Committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments."
 We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keeping longer -term inflation expectations well anchored.
 Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run.
 We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum -employment and price -stability goals.
" Fed Governor Chris Waller said that if inflation continues to fall, then the Fed in the next several months could be cutting interest rates."
" I wonder if you could comment on whether you agree with Fed Governor Waller on that, that the Fed would become more restrictive if it didn ’t cut rates if inflation fell."
" We are seeing, you know, strong growth that  is—that  appears to be moderating ; we’re seeing a labor market that is coming back into balance by so many measures;  and we ’re seeing inflation making real progress."
" I have always felt, since the beginning, that there was a possibility, because of the unusual situation, that the economy could cool off in a way that enabled inflation to come down without the kind of large job losses that have often been associated with high inflation and tightening cycles."
" And not only did that not happen—that includes F ed forecasters and really , essentially , all forecasters ; a very high proportion of forecasters predicted very weak growth or a recession —not only did that not happen, we actually had a very strong year, and that was a combination of , of strong demand but also of real gains on the supply side."
"So this was the year when labor force participation picked up, where immigration picked up, where the distortions to supply and demand from the pandemic —you know, the shortages and the bottlenecks —really began to unwind."
" So we had significant supplyside gains with strong demand, and we got what looks like a 2½ percent -plus, or a little more than that , growth year at a time when potential growth this year might even have been higher than that, just because of the healing on the supply side."
"I think the inflation forecast is roughly , roughly what people wrote down a year ago, but in a very different setting ."
" And I would say the labor market , because of the stronger growth, has also been significantly better."
" If you look back at the SEP from a year ago, there was a December 13 , 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 9 of 24   significant increase in , in unemployment."
" So we’ve seen, you know, strong growth, still a tight labor market but one that ’s coming back into balance with the—with support from the supply side, a greater supply of labor."
" I, I wonder if you could give a little more color or detail on what —on what  motivates the lower rates next year, whether it’ s a coincidence, for example, that the spread between PC E inflation, core inflation, and the federal funds rate stays constant over the year."
" Are you simply calibrating against the fall in prices, in the price level that you ’re expecting, in the rate of inflation that you ’re expecting as o pposed to supporting the economy?"
" A nd I think if you look at the big difference from September in the SEP, [it is that] the expectations for inflation this year, both headline and core, have come down, you know, really significantly in three months."
" At the same time, [real GDP] growth has turned out to be very stro ng in the third quarter ."
" I ’m wondering, just related to, to Steve ’s question, how the —how the  tactics of this play out given the slowing of inflation and the fact that the deeper you get into 2024, the closer you get to a presidential election."
 The markets seem to think inflation is coming down credibly.
 Do you believe we ’re at the point where inflation is coming down credibly?
" You’re actually above 3  percent on core , through November , PCE  [inflation]."
" And that —it’s one of our two jobs, along with maximum employment, and they ’re equal."
" In the SEP from today, [real GDP] growth is notably below potential in 2024."
" If growth were to surprise us again in the way that it has for years now by being stronger than December 13 , 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 13 of 24   expected next year, would it still be possible to cut rates ?"
" Or, put another way, is below -trend growth necessary to cut rates, or would continued progress on inflation alone be sufficient?"
" Growth is one thing, so is inflation , so is labor market data."
" If we have stronger growth, you know, that ’ll be good for people."
 It might actually mean that it takes a little longer to get inflation down to 2 percent.
" We will get it down to 2  percent, but , you know, if we see stronger growth, we’ll—we will set policy according to what we actually see ."
" I guess the —I guess the question I ’m asking, if you don’ t mind a quick follow -up, I guess the question I ’m asking is, is above -trend growth itself a problem?"
" And, you know, if you have —if you have  growth that ’s robust , what that will mean is probably it will keep the labor market very strong."
" It probably will , will place some upward pressure on inflation."
 That could mean that it takes longer to get to 2  percent inflation.
" It’s—you see —you see  job growth still strong but moving back down to more sustainable levels , given population growth and labor force participation."
" If you look at shortages of workers, whereas they thought job, job availability was the highest that it ’d ever been or close to it, that’s now down to more normal levels  by so many measures —participation, unemployment —so many measures:   the unemployment —job openings, quits, all of those things."
 So wages are still running a bit above what would be consistent with 2 percent inflation over a long period of time.
" And I guess there , there  are just a couple of other —the unemployment rate is very, very low."
" A common theme is that, while inflation is coming down, and that ’s very good news, the price level is not coming down."
" So [nominal] wages are now moving up more than inflation, as inflation comes down."
" The thing that we can do is to do our jobs, which is to use our tools to foster price stability, which has such great benefits over such long periods of time , and which is the thing that really enables us to work for and achieve an extended period of high employment, which is so beneficial for, you know, families and, and companies around the country."
" I wanted to ask, you know, on, on the flip side of if things start to deteriorate rapidly, if we do fall into a recession, if we do start to see unemployment rise, at sort of the levels of inflation that we ’re seeing now, how would you all think about that in terms of rate cuts?"
" Would that be a sign that you ’ve, you’ve  done your job demandwise?"
" Obviously, we ’re hoping to, to see something very different —which is a continuation of what we have seen, which is the labor market coming into better balance without a significant increase in unemployment, inflation coming down without a significant increase in unemployment, and growth moderating without a significant increa se in unemployment."
" Mr. Chairman, you were, by your own admission, behind the curve in starting to raise rates to fight inflation, and you said earlier, again, “ the full effects of our tightening (cycle)  have not yet been felt.”  How will you decide when to cut rates, and how will you ensure you’ re not behind the curve there?"
" You know, we ’re, we’re  obviously looking hard at what ’s happening with demand, and what we see ?"
 We see good evidence and good reason to believe that growth will come in lower next year.
" I think the median  growth—median  participant wrote down 1.4 percent growth, but , you know, we ’ll have to see."
" We’ll also be looking to see progress on inflation and, you know, the labor market remaining strong but , but ideally , without see ing the kind of large increase in unemployment that happens sometimes."
" And you focused on core  inflation, we ’ve heard from— in other meetings."
 How sticky is core inflation right now?
" Well, that ’s what we ’re finding out, and we ’ve, you know, we ’ve seen real progress in , in core inflation."
" I’m assuming those were not incorporated into the forecast we see today, but I just wanted to ask, you know, how that kind of adds to your thinking, you know, on the inflation outlook."
" So we got —we got  CPI the morning of the first day, and we got PPI the next day, which informs the, you know, the translation into PCE  [inflation]."
" And so, for example, if it ’s risen, and I ’m not saying that it  has, but if it were to have risen, that would mean that , that interest rates would need to be a little bit higher to convey the same level of restriction."
"In terms of demand, has demand shifted more away from services into goods?"
 You said back in July that you needed to start cutting rates before getting to 2 percent inflation.
" As you mentioned, PCE inflation is now running at 3 ½ on core."
" I mean , you’ d want to be reducing restriction on the economy well before 2 percent because—or before you get to 2 percent so you don’ t overshoot, if we think, think of restrictive policy as weighing on economic activity."
" You know, it takes —it takes a while for policy to get into the economy, affect economic activity, and affect inflation."
 I wanted to go back to the stickinessof-inflation question.
" Over the past couple of years, a lot of central bankers have talked about the more difficult last mile of getting inflation back down to 2  percent, yet it ’s also been surprising how fast inflation has come down this year."
" I’m curious, do you think something has changed in our understanding of inflation, or do you subscribe to this notion still ?"
" The first factor is just the unwinding of, of  what happened in the pandemic :  the distortions of supply and demand."
" A nd the second thing would be our policy, which was weighing on aggregate demand and actually making it easier for the supply side to recover because of lower demand."
" I think that this inflation was not the classic demand overload, potboiling -over, kind of inflation that we [typically] think about."
" It was a combination of very strong demand, without question, and unusual supplyside restriction s, both on the goods side but December 13 , 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 22 of 24   also on the labor side, because we had a—we had a  participation shock."
" So we , we had the view that you could come straight down that vertical supply curve to the extent demand [was] lowered, reduced."
" Immigration could help, but it may be that , at some point —at some point , you will run out of supplyside help, and then it gets down to demand, and it gets harder."
" I mean , inflation keeps coming down."
