 My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.
" We understand the hardship that high inflation is causing, and we remain strongly committed to bringing inflation b ack down to our 2 percent goal."
" Since early last year, the FOMC has significantly tightened the stance of monetary policy."
 We have raised our policy interest rate by 5¼ percentage points and have continued to reduce our securities holdings at a brisk pace.
 The stance of policy is restrictive—meaning that tight policy is putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation—a nd the full effects of our tightening have yet to be felt.
" Today, we decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to reduce our securi ties holdings."
 I ’ll have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments.
 Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a strong pace and well above earlier expectations.
 Higher interest rates also appear to be weighing on business fixed investment.
" The labor market remains tight, but supply and demand conditions continue to come into better balance."
 The unemployment rate remains low at 3.8  percent.
" Nominal wage growth has shown some signs of easing, and job vacancies have declined so far this year."
" Although the jobsto-workers gap has narrowed, l abor demand still exceeds the supply of available workers."
 Inflation remains well above our longerrun goal of 2 percent.
" Inflation has moderated since t he middle of last year, and readings over the summer were quite favorable."
 But a few months of good data are only the beginning of what it will take to build confidence that inflation is moving down sustainably toward our goal.
 The process of getting inflation sustainably down to 2 percent has a long way to go.
" Despite elevated inflation, longerterm inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecast ters, as well as measures from financial markets."
 The Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.
" My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship as it erodes purchasing power, espe cially for November 1, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  Page 3 of 27   those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation."
" We are highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 perc ent objective."
 Our restrictive stance of monetary policy is putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation.
" We are committed to achieving a sta nce of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation sustainably down to 2 percent over time, and to keeping policy restrictive until we are confident that inflation is on a path to that objective."
 We are attentive to recent data showing the resilience of economic growth and demand for labor.
" Evidence of growth persistently above potential, or that tightness in the labor market is no longer easing, could put further progress on inflation at risk and could warrant further tightening of monetary policy."
" Because persistent changes in financial conditions can have implications for the path of monetary policy, we monitor financi al developments closely."
" We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting, based on the totality of the incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation as well as the balance of risks."
" In determining the extent of additional policy firming November 1, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  Page 4 of 27   that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time, the Committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments."
 We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keeping longer -term inflation expectations well anchored.
 Reducing inflation is likely to require a period of below -potential growth and some softening of labor market condit ions.
 Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run.
 We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum -employment and price -stability goals.
" Inflation has been coming down, but it ’s still running well above our 2 percent target."
" GDP growth has been strong, although many forecasters are forecasting , and they have bee n forecasting, that it will slow."
" November 1, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  Page 5 of 27   As for the C ommittee, we are committed to achieving a stance of monetary policy that ’s sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to 2 percent over time , and we ’re not confident yet that we have achieved such a stance."
" As I mentioned, persistent changes in broader financial conditions can have implications for the path of monetary policy."
"  So, in the meantime , though, perhaps the most important thing is that these higher Treasury yields are showing through to higher borrowing cost s for households and businesses and those higher costs are going to weigh on economic activity to the extent this tightening persists and the mind ’s eye goes to the 8 percent —near 8 percent mortgage rate, November 1, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  Page 6 of 27   which could have pretty significant effect on housing."
" And that ’s—that is —the way we ’re going to be going into these future meetings is to be , you know, just determining the extent of any additional further policy tighte ning that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time."
" I wonder , you know, if you don’ t raise interest rates in December, would the presumption be at that point that we should expect that rates are at their peak, or is there a possibility of restarting rate increases next year?"
" But we ’re going into December meeting —we ’ll get, as you know, two more inflation ratings, two more labor market readings, some data on, on economic activity, and so we ’ll be taking —and also the broader situation , the broader financial condition situation and broader world situation."
" I ’d like to follow  up and ask what makes you confident —what makes you confident in the tighter financial conditions will slow above -trend growth when 500 basis points of rate hikes, QT, and a minor banking crisis have not thus far?"
" Well , I just— that’s, you know, the way our policy works is —and sometimes it works with lags , of course, which can be long and variable, but ultimately , if you raise interest rates, you do see those effects ."
" Our job is to—is to achieve maximum employment and price stability , and so we take the economy as it comes."
" In terms of the thresholds that you’ ve laid out of what could warrant further tightening, the additional evidence of persistently above -trend growth, or some kind of reversal in the recent easing of labor market tightness —that seems to suggest something more powerful than just one more ¼ point rate hike would be necessary."
" You know, what ’s happening with our progress toward the 2 percent inflation goal ?"
" You know, growth —we look at growth insofar as it has implications for our two manda te goals ."
" We’re still very focused on the first question, which is , have we achieved a stance of monetary policy that ’s sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to 2 percent over time sustainably?"
 And what we ’ve sa id there is that we ’ll keep policy restrictive until we ’re confident that inflation is on a sustainable path down to 2 percent.
" You say in the statement you ’re looking to assess the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the extent to which you may need to hike additionally."
" I would say—I mean , the language , looking at it here, “I n determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time."
" But I would go back to—the bigger picture from our standpoint is, we ’ve got a very strong economy, strong labor market, making progress on the labor market, making progress on inflation ."
 And we ’re very focused on getting confident that we have achieved a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive.
" You know, what you hear —and it ’s consistent there—which is people are really suffering under high inflation."
 You ’ve spoken before about the pain that would likely be coming for the economy in order to get inflation down.
" But since the economy has not responded to rate hikes in ways that would normally be expected, have you changed your views on that at all —on how necessary or inevitable that kind of pain would be, say, for the labor market or overall growth?"
" Well , I think everyone has been very gratified to see that we ’ve been able to achieve , you know, pretty significant progress on inflation without seeing the kind of increase in unemployment that has been very typical of rate hiking cycles like this one."
 And the same is true of growth.
" You know, w e’ve been saying that we need to see below -potential growth ."
" And growth has been strong, but yet we ’re still seeing this."
"  It is still likely to be true —not a certainty —but likely that we will need to see some slower growth and some softening in the labor market —in labor market conditions to get , you know, to fully restore price stability."
 One of them —one of which is the unwinding of the distortions to both supply and demand [that arose] from the pandemic and the response to the pandemic.
"  And the other is , is, you know, restrictive monetary policy, which is moderating demand and giving the supply side time to recover —time and space to recover."
  So you see those two forces now working together to bring down inflation.
" But it’ s that first one can bring down inflation without the need for higher unemployment or slower growth, it ’s just —it’s supply—you know, supplyside improvements like shortages and bottlenecks and that kind of thing going away."
 And that’s where monetary policy and what we do with demand is still going to be important.
  So I don’t—I think we have to make monetary policy under great uncertainty about how long the lags are.
"”  And this is one of the reasons why we have slowed the process down this year , was to give monetary policy time to get into the economy."
" One quick clarification  I wanted to ask about Rachel ’s question is, you said you need slower growth."
 You had always said before a period of lower -thantrend growth.
 So the dot plot is a picture in time of what the people in the C ommittee think is likely to be appropriate monetary policy in light of their own personal economic forecast.
" In terms of —so we ’re not really changing the way—in terms of growth, what I said was “below potential .”  So what you have here recently is growth that is —that is temporarily —potential growth is elevated for a year or two right now over its trend level."
" So the right way to think about it is, what ’s potential growth this year?"
" People think trend growth over a long period of time is a little bit less than 2 percent , or I would say just around 2 percent."
" But what we ’ve had is , with the—with the, you know, improvement in the size of the labor force, as I mentioned, through both participation and immigration, and with the , the, you know, the better functioning in the labor market and with the —with the, you know, the unwinding of the supply chain and shortages and those kinds of things, you’ re seeing actually elevated potential growth."
 There ’s catch -up growth that can happen in potential.
 We’re asking ourselves whether we’ ve achieved a stance of policy that is sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to 2 percent over time .
 Monetary policy is restrictive .
" So for the last three months, the year -overyear PCE inflation was at 3.4 percent, core well over 3 percent."
" You ’ve said in the past, 2 percent remains the Federal Reserve target, but with no rate increase today, how long would you be okay then with a 3 percent or 3 percent plus overall inflation?"
" You know, I think the core PCE [inflation rate] came down by almost 60 basis points in the third quarter."
" So  the best thing I could point you to would be the September SEP where , you know, the expectation was that , that  inflation by the end of November 1, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  Page 20 of 27   next year, on a 12month trailing basis, would be well into the 2s  and the year after that, further into the 2s."
"  So that ’s, that’s —if you look historically, that ’s, that’s  sort of consistent with the way inflation comes down."
" But the good news is, you know, we ’re making progress and monetary policy is restrictive."
"  But you’ ve said in the past that doing too little on interest rates could take years to fix, but the cost of doing too much could be easily fixed."
" And we know that, if we fail to restore price stability, the risk is that expectations of higher inflation get entrenched in the economy, and we know that that ’s really bad for people."
 Inflation will be both more —both higher and more volatile .
" And—but we ’re committed to getting inflation back down to our target over time , and we will."
 Quick second question about inflation expectations —the U .
Michigan  sentiment s urvey showed a big jump in one -yearahead inflation expectations last month from 3.2 to 4.2.  Last year you said that particular survey was a really decisive factor in one of your rate hike decisions .
" And, you know, there ’s—it’s just cl ear that inflation expectations are in a good place ."
" The public does believe that inflation will get back down to 2 percent over time, ."
" Y ou can always find one reading that is a little bit out of whack , but, honestly, the bulk of them are just very clear that the public believes that inflation will come down ."
" It’s a very important variable in , in the way we think about monetary policy, but you can’ t identify it with any precision in real  time."
"  What we know now is , you know, within a range of estimates of the neutral rate policy, is restrictive, and it ’s therefore putting downward pressure on economic activity, hiring, and inflation."
 Does it —does it  feel like monetary policy is restrictive enough to bring inflation down to 2 percent over time?
" Earlier you talked about the inflation outlook, but I ’m curious if you have any concerns whether wage inflation at its current level could be —could risk pushing up overall inflation or re -acceleration ?"
" So , if you look at the —look at the broad range of wages, they have —wage increases have really come down significantly over the course of the last 18 months to a level where they ’re substantially closer to that level that would be consistent with 2 percent inflation over time, making standard assumptions about productivity over time."
" Also I would say it isn’ t—in my thinking, it ’s not the case that , that  wages have been the princip al driver of inflation so far, although I think it ’s all—I do think it ’s fair to say that , as we go forward, as monetary policy becomes more important relative to the supplyside issues I ’ve talked about in the unwinding of the pandemic e ffects, it may be that the labor market becomes more important over time , too."
" Chair Powell, are you now as concerned about overshooting and raising interest rates too much as you are about getting inflation down to the 2 percent target?"
 I t was not getting rates high enough in time to avoid having inflation expectations —higher inflation expectations become entrenched.
" That range, if you take off a mainstream estimate of the expected inflation, take one year inflation, you’ re going to see that ."
" Well, I think what we ’re looking at is are we still— is inflation still broadly cooling?"
" Do we —is it sort of validating the path we saw over the summer, where inflation was clearly cooling and coming down."
 Are we seeing —is inflation still coming down?
" The second thing is , in the labor market , what we ’ve seen is a very positive rebalancing of supply and demand, partly through just much more supply coming online ."
" And with labor demand still clearly remaining very strong—when you have the kind of job growth we ’ve had over the last quarter , it’s still very strong demand."
 Do you think that there has been any structural change in either consumption or in the job market that ’s pushing at consumption?
" The dynamic has been really strong job creation with now  wages that are—that are higher than inflation, in the aggregate anyway, and that raises real disposable income, and that raises November 1, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  Page 26 of 27   spending, which continues to drive more hiring."
" So  the whole thing has led to more growth, more spending, and that kind of thing."
" And i t’s been —you know, it’s been  good, and the thing is, we ’ve been achieving progress on inflation in the middle of this."
"The F ed’s Financial Stability Report said the Israel –Hamas conflict and the conflict in Ukraine “pose important risks to global economic activity, including the possibility of sustained disruptions to regional trade and food, energy, and other commodities.”   You ’ve had organizations at the W orld Bank warning of a possibl e surge in oil prices if the war spreads to other countries in the region."
