" My colleagues and I have one overarching goal:  to sustain the economic expansion, with a strong job market and stable prices, for the benefit of the American people."
" The U.S. economy is in a good place, and we will continue to use our monetary policy tools to help keep it there."
" The unemployment rate is near historic low s, and inflation remains near our 2 percent goal."
" With the benefit of fiscal stimulus and other tailwinds, growth in 2018 was strong —in fact, at 3.1 percent, the strongest  year in more than a decade."
" For some time, most forecasts have called for growth to continue in 2019 at a somewhat lower but still healthy pace."
" For example, last September, Committee participants saw growth coming in at about 2.5 perce nt this year."
   Data arriving since September suggest that growth is slowing somewhat more than expected.
" While conditions March 20, 2019      Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 2 o f 23  have eased since then, they remain less supportive of growth than during most of 2018."
" Growth has slowed in some foreign economies —notably , in Europe and China."
 Unusually strong payroll job growth in January was followed by little growth at all in February.
" Smoothing through these variations, average monthly job growth appears to have stepped down from last year’s strong pace, but job gains remain well above the pace necessary to provide jobs for new labor force entrants."
" Weak retail sales data for December bounced back considerably in January but , on balance , seem to point to somewhat slower growth in consumer spending."
" Inflation has been muted, and some indicators of longer -term inflation expectations remain at the low end  of their ranges in recent years."
" FOMC participants sought —now see 2019 growth at roughly 2 percent, with the unem ployment rate remaining below 4  percent."
" Core inflation, which omits the effects of volatile food and energy prices, remains close to 2  percent."
" Declines in oil prices since last fall are expected to push headline inflation below 2 percent for a time, but this effect is likely to be temporary."
" Now , I’m March 20, 2019      Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 3 o f 23  describing views of the most likely outcomes, but historical experience reminds us that growth and inflation this year could be stronger or wea ker than what we now project."
 It may be some time before the outlook for jobs and inflation calls clearly for a change in policy.
" Thus, we always emphasize that the interest rate projections in the SEP are not a Committee decision."
 We have long said that the size of the balance sheet will be considered normalized when the balance sheet is once again at the smallest level consistent with conductin g monetary policy efficiently and effectively.
" When the Committee judges that reserves should not decline further, securities holdings will again begin to rise, as dictated by the grow th of demand for our reserve and nonreserve liabilities."
" So, as I mentioned, FOMC participants continue to see growth this year of around 2 percent, just a bit below what we saw  back in —at the end of last year."
 You ’ve got very low unemployment.
"As far as  balance sheet —the balance sheet plan, the answer to that is, you asked whether that’s related to our monetary policy , in effect, and the answer is really “ no.”  We are—we still—we think of the interest rate tool as the principal tool of monetary policy, and we think of ourselves as returning the balance sheet to a normal level over the course of the next six months ."
 And we ’re not really thinking of those as two different tools of monetary policy.
 That was the year of synchronized global growth.
" And just as st rong global growth was a tailwind, weaker global growth can be a headwind to our economy."
" Chinese authorities have taken many steps since the middle of last year to support economic activity, and I think the base case is that , ultimately , Chinese activity will stabilize at an attractive level."
" And in Europe, you know, we see some weakening, but, again, we don’ t see—we don’ t see recession, and w e do see positive growth still."
 I think the main factors are the de levering campaign that th e government undertook a couple of years ago and also just the longer -term slowing to a more sustainable pace of growth that economies find as they mature.
" And we put in place, really , an unprecedented sanction in the form of an asset growth cap, and we will not lift that until Wells Fargo gets their arms around this, comes forward with plans, implements those plans, and we ’re satisfied with what they ’ve done."
" So, in our SEP projections, C ommittee members, participants, generally see growth of around 2 percent."
 They see unemployment remaining below 4 percent.
 They see inflation remaining close to target.
" And they see growth, as I said, around 2 percent."
" You know , you see slowing global growth."
 We ’re also carefully monitoring what ’s happening with U.S. growth.
" On the other hand, as I mentioned, we see the underlying economic fundamentals for growth this year as still very positive."
"  I’m curious, you’re now a full percentage point —actually , more than a percentage point —below the White House in your projections for growth this year."
 You can think of growth as being composed of two things.
 And one is really growth in the workforce —more hours worked.
 And the other is productivity —it’s output per hour.
 You can really think of growth as those two things.
Productivity is much harder.
 It’s v ery difficult to  project productivity over long stretches of time.
" So , I guess I would say, what is the potential growth rate?"
 I think it ’s clear that the tax and spending policies that were adopted early last year supported demand in a significant way last year.
" You March 20, 2019      Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 10 o f 23  know, the idea would be that lowering corporate taxes would spur more corporate investment, which would spur more productivity, and lowering individual taxes would spur greater labor force participation."
 Inflation is close to target.
" Does  it concern you, given that the F ed has traditionally been a consensus -                                                 1 Chair Powell intended to say that the unemployment rate is under 4 percent."
" Just —you mentione d that you have , kind of , a positive outlook as it regards the economy but also see slower growth on the household side and the business side."
" It’s strong economic underlying fundamentals , so, rising wages, high levels of employment, low levels of unemployment, high levels of job creation , confidence."
"And I would also say, you know, that the whole question of monetary policy and financial stability is an unsettled and difficult one in our world."
" We do think that the principal tools for, you know, for managing financial stability are regulation, supervision, macroprudential tools, and those sorts of things a s opposed to changing the interest rate."
" If I could ask a follow -up—i f it’s the case that we’ re in a lower neutral interest rate world where you could have more asse t price appreciation, do you think the Fed needs more macroprudential tools so that it doesn’ t have to lean  on monetary policy to do so much ?"
" I do think that deficits matter, and I do think— I think it ’s not really controversial to say that our debt can ’t grow faster than our economy indefi nitely and that ’s what it’s doing now."
" How much of a factor has this been for the F ed in turning towards a kind of patient approach to monetary policy, and what ’s your base case on that?"
" Chairman Powell, could you talk through your outlook for inflation this year?"
 And rising —why aren ’t risin g wages feeding into inflation?
" So —but that ’s not price inflation , that’s wage inflation."
" Our mandate, sorry, is price inflation."
 So what I see is inflation that’ s close to 2 percent but that sort of keeps bumping up against 2 percent and then maybe  moving back down a little bit.
" What we really mean is that we would look at —we know that inflation will move around on both sides of the target, and what we say is  that we would be equally concerned with inflation persistently above as  persistently below the target."
" And I don’t think we’ve quite achieved that yet, because we’re really 10 years deep in this —almost 10 years —in this exp ansion, and inflation is still kind of, I’d say , not, you know, clearly meeting our target."
" I think, as I’ve said before, I think inflation that is a little bit below our target—March 20, 2019      Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 16 o f 23  particularly headline inflation this year will be, you know, meaningfully below our target for most of the year because of lower oil prices, but we project that  core will be too—t hat gives us the ability to be patient and not move until we see that our target goals are being ac hieved."
" I just wanted to press a little bit about, what is the story the C ommittee —you know, when you get in the discussion today and yesterday about inflation, what kind of is the story that emerges?"
 One of them is just that the natural rate of unemployment is lower than people think.
" Another is tha t expectations play a very —inflation expectations play a very key role in our framework and other frameworks, and, you know, there is the possibility that some people discuss of expectations being anchored but below 2 percent."
" I’m just kind of curious —I mean , this below -target inflation is a globa l phenomenon, at least across advanced economies, and I’d just like to kind of hear your thoughts about what kind of challenges that poses to policymakers like yourself and the global economy in general."
" It’s one of the major challenges of our time, really, to have inflation— you know, downward pressure on inflation, let ’s say."
" So if inflation expectations a re below 2 percent, they ’re always going to be pulling inflation down, and we’re going to be paddling upstream in  trying to, you know, keep inflation at 2 percent, which gives us some room March 20, 2019      Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 17 o f 23  to cut, you know, when it’ s time to cut rates when the economy weak ens."
 It’s one of the —one of the things we ’re looking into as  part of our strategic monetary policy review this year.
" The proximity to the  zero lower bound calls for more creative thinking about ways we can, you know, uphold the credibility of our inflation target, and, you know, we ’re open minded about ways we can do that."
 Fed Vice Chairman Rich Clarida has talked about how the decline in labor ’s share of income and the corresponding high profit margins might mean that lower unemployment and high er wage growth is not flowing through to price inflation the way it used to.
" March 20, 2019      Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 18 o f 23  has not allowed wage growth to rise above longer -term interest rates until just very recently ."
" So I’m wondering if , going forward, given these insights about the labor share and high profit margins and t he linkage between wages and prices, would you be in favor of allowing wage growth to continue accel erating without matching that with  higher interest rates?"
" Well , let me say that we ’ve had, you know, a significant move up in wages and compe nsation over the last few years, and I —which does not trouble me from the standpoint of inflation."
" We ’ve had —also had —in other cycles, we’ve had situations where, you know, unit labor costs were moving up above inflation, and that didn’ t lead to price inf lation."
" But, nonetheless, I don’t see the current wage picture as concernin g from an inflation standpoint."
" More generally, to the extent that wage growth in excess of interest rates allows households to pay down debt faster , whereas interest rates in excess of wage growth risk s a further buildup in debt, how do you account for the sort of financial stability consequences of varyi ng interest  rates relative to wage growth?"
" I don’ t think we look at —I understand what you’re asking, but we ’re looking at —our mandate is price inflation and maximum employment, and that ’s what we ’re looking at with setting interest rates."
" I’m asking because we’re seeing the waning  effect of tax reform and no material news on infrastructure, s o just wondering kind of how you feel the monetary policy –fiscal policy balance is in swing right  now ."
" A nd if it is our view at that time that we ’re still a ways away from—a ways above a balance sheet that is what we need to efficiently  and effectively conduct monetary policy, at that time we will hold the balance sheet constant."
" The level of reserve demand is something that we ’ve put a lot of effort and time into creating estimates , based on market intelligence and surveys and that kind of thing."
