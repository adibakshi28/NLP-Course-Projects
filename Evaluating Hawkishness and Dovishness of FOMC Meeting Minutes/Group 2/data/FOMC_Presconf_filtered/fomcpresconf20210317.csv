 We are strongly committed to achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us:  maximum employment and price stability.
 Today the FOMC kept interest rates near zero and maintained our sizable asset purchases.
" These meas ures, along with our strong guidance on interest rates and on our balance sheet, will ensure that monetary policy will continue to deliver powerful support to the economy until the recovery is complete."
"Following the moder ation in the pace of the recovery that began toward the end of last year, indicators of economic activity and employment have turned up recently, although the sectors of the economy most adversely affected by the resurgence of the virus and by greater social distancing remain weak."
"The overall recovery in economic activity since last spring is due importantly to unprecedented fiscal and mone tary policy actions, which have provided essential support to households, businesses, and communities."
" The recovery has progressed more quickly than generally expected, and forecasts from FOMC participants for economic growth this year have been revised u p notably since our December Summary of Economic Projections."
" As with overall economic activity, conditions in the labor market have turned up recently."
" Employment rose by 379,000 in February, as the leisure and hospitality sector recouped about March 17, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 3 of 30   twothirds of the jobs that were lost in December and January."
" Nonetheless, employment in this sector is more than 3 million below its level at the  onset of the pandemic."
" For the economy as a whole, employment is 9.5 million below its pre -pandemic level."
" The unemployment rate remains elevated at 6.2 percent in February; this figure understates the shortfall in employment, particularly as participat ion in the labor market remains notably below pre -pandemic levels."
" Looking ahead, FOMC participants project the unemployment rate to continue to decline; the median projection is 4.5 percent at the end of this year and moves down to 3.5 percent by the end of 2023."
 Overall inflation remains below our 2 percent longerrun objective.
" Over the next few months, 12month measures  of inflation will move up as the very low readings from March and April of last year fall out of the calculation."
" However, these onetime increases in prices are likely to have only transient effects on inflation."
 The median inflation projection of FOMC participants is 2.4 perc ent this year and declines to 2 percent next year before moving back up by the end of 2023.
" The Fed ’s response to this crisis has been guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibil ities to promote the financial— the stability of the financial system."
" As we say in our Statement on March 17, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 4 of 30   Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, we view maximum employment as a “broadbased and inclusive goal.”  Our ability to achieve maximum employment  in the years ahead depends importantly on having longer -term inflation expectations well anchored at 2 percent."
" As the Committee reiterated in today ’s policy statement, with inflation running persistently below 2 percent, we will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer -term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent."
 We expect to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these employment and i nflation outcomes are achieved.
" With regard to interest rates, we continue to expect it will be appropriate to maintain the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with th e Committee ’s assessment of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time."
" I would note that a transitory rise in inflation above 2 percent, as seems likely to occur this year, would not meet this standard."
" In addition, we will continue to increase our holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency mortgage -backed securities by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been ma de toward our maximum -employment and price -stability goals."
" The economy is a long way from our employment an d inflation goals, and it is likely to take some time for substantial further progress to be achieved."
" Our forward guidance for the federal funds rate, along with our balance sheet guidance, will ensure that the stance of monetary policy remains highly accommodative as the recovery progresses."
" Our guidance is outcome based and ties the path of the federal funds rate and the March 17, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 5 of 30   balance sheet to progress toward reaching our employment and inflation goals."
" Overall, our interest rate and balance sheet tools are providing powerful support to the economy and will continue to do so."
" So  could you talk us through how the , the forecasts for 2021 map into the “ substantial further progress ” definition —you know, 2.4 percent inflation—I  understand that ’s considered transitory."
" That still seems like some progress there, 4½ percent unemployment ."
" It is , we want to see that , that the labor markets have moved —labor market conditions have moved —you know, have made substantial progress toward maximum employment, and inflation has made substantial progress toward the 2 percent goal."
" We do expect that we’ ll begin to make faster progress on both spending—you know, labor markets and inflation as the year goes on because of the progress with the vaccines, because of the fiscal support that we’ re getting."
"  But just sort of more broadly, do you think, long  term , that the leverage ratio poses problems for implementing monetary policy at a time when the reserve supply is going to remain large ?"
" Well, then I ’ll ask about unemployment."
" You know, there ’s—the unemployment rate is —you all have projections for the U -6 rate, but you ’ve also been, you know, really emphasizing the fact that that ’s not the only thing that you all are looking at."
 So are you all looking at ways of maybe adding to how you’ re projecting the unemployment rate to the Summary of Economic P rojections ?
"  We never only looked at the unemployment rate, which is the only indicator of , of labor market outcomes that’s in the SEP."
" You hear us talk all the time about participation ; about em ployment to population, which is the combination of the two;  about different measures of, of  unemployment."
 All that g oes into an assessment of maximum employment .
" You know, obviously, the thing that we do include is just the unemployment rate , and that ’s a very insufficient statistic ."
" You ’re forecasting a very low unemployment rate next year and in 2023, you have inflation —or, the Fed overall is, in the SEP, forecasting inflation at or above 2 percent by 2023, yet no rate hike in any of this —in any of this forecast horizon ."
 So is this telling us that we could see a higher inflation rate than was projected ?
" Or do you not —as you’ ve been talking about, is the unemployment rate insufficient?"
" And it ’s really three things:  labor market conditions that are consistent with our estimates of maximum employment—a nd, as I mentioned, we consider a  wide range of indicators in assessing labor market conditions, not just the unemployment rate ; inflation that has reached 2  percent, and not just on a transitory basis ; and inflation that ’s on track to run moderately above 2 percent for some time ."
" One, how high are you comfortable letting inflation rise ?"
" There , there  is some ambiguity in, in your new target, as you mentioned, “ expectations driven .”  And, and do you think that that ambiguity might cause markets to price in a lower tolerance for inflation than the Fed actually has, thereby causing financial conditions to tighten prematurely?"
 So we ’ve said we’ d like to see inflation run moderately above 2 percent for some time .
" Part of that just is , talking about inflation is one thing;  actually having inflation run above 2 percent is the real thing."
" So I—you know, over the years we ’ve, we’ve  talked about 2 percent inflation as a goal, but we haven ’t achieved it ."
" That ’s what we ’d really like to do, is to get inflation moderately above 2 percent ."
" I’m curious, based on the projections that you released today that show unemployment will still be above  estimates of maximum employment through the end of next year and perhaps sometime into 2023, do you think policymakers need to be doing more here to sort of align the herd immunity and full employment timelines, if you will?"
" There is an element of j udgment in that , and we ’ll, we’ll—therefore , we’ll  supply clear communication well in advance of , of actually tapering, and we just went through, you know, the , the criteria for raising interest rates ."
" If I could just briefly follow up , how do you see sort of the disconnect in terms of an economy that is expected to be widely reopened this year but full employment taking longer to achieve ?"
" You know, it can—it can  happen maybe , maybe  more quickly than it has in the past, because it involves the reopening of a sector of the economy, as opposed to stimulating aggregate demand and waiting for that to produce job demand for workers ."
" No matter how well the economy performs, unemployment will  take quite a time to go —to go  down, and so will participation."
 We think the stance of our —of monetary policy remains appropriate .
" What I ’m telling you is that the stance of monetary policy we have today, we believe , is appropriate ."
 And I ’m curious if you can speak to specific indicators that the Fed will be using to measure job gains for groups that have persistently higher rates of unemployment compared to white Americans .
" So the African American unemployment rate is substantially elevated, and so is the Hispanic unemployment rate."
"We—our tools, of course, affect unemployment generally, but we ’re going to look at those as, as  a form of slack in the labor market and hope that, you know, that  there ’s progress there ."
" And I think that ’s just the size and the speed with which Congress has delivered—you know, with the CARES Act and since then, has —is going to wind up very much accelerating the return to full employment ."
" It’s, it’s maximum employment and price stability here in the United States ."
 So I think U.S. demand—very strong U.S .
"demand, if, if—as the economy improves is going to support global activity as well over time ."
" And that layer s, you know, very significant additional stress on top of the stress the banks have already absorbed over the past year, with the unemployment rate going to 11 percent and stock prices falling more than 50 percent ."
" We’ ve set out very clear criteria for liftoff, right,  where we’ ve said we want to see labor market conditions that are consistent with our estimates of, of  maximum employment ."
" And that doesn’ t just mean unemployment, it means a much broader set of criteria ."
" We want inflation at 2 percent , and not on a transitory basis ."
 And  we want inflation on track to be moderately —to run moderately above 2 percent for some time .
" So you’ re going to have differe nt perspectives from C ommittee participants about how fast growth will be, how fast the labor market will hea l, or how fast —sorry, inflation will move up."
 But it ’s an estimate based on —based on assumptions about growth.
" But, really, I wanted to make the longer -run point th at if—to work on the productivity—on productivity  over longer periods, that is—that is —comes down to a number of things ."
" I ’m just saying , that, that is what fiscal policy can do that , really , monetary policy can’ t do—is, is invest in the future productive capacity of the economy, raise potential growth ."
" The inflation that you’ re talking about for this year , you say, is “transitory .”  Then , by 2023, you’ re back down to 2.1 percent ."
" If you get to 3½ percent unemployment but inflation is only at 2 or 2.1 percent, are you willing to leave rates at zero going forward from there —or, roughly zero going forward from there ?"
" In other words, could we be in a Japanlike situation where  rates just stay low because inflation does ?"
 And  they’re —also remember that the SEP doesn ’t actually include all the things that go into maximum employment .
" It’s, it’s only —it only includes unemployment ."
" It’s inflation up t o—no, sorry, it ’s, it’s labor market conditions consistent with our estimates of maximum employment —and that ’s not just unemployment, it ’s all the other indicators, but , overall, totaling up to maximum employment ; it’s inflation at 2 percent , and not on a transient basis;  and inflation on track to exceed 2 percent for —moderately for some time ."
" If I could follow up , I’m just wondering—before 2019, I would say you were focused on the problems with having interest rates too low ."
 Now are you saying we’re willing to live with it until we reach these goals even if you get—meet your  goal on maximum employment ?
" So what I would say is , we’re committed to giving the economy the support that it needs to return as quickly as possible to a state of maximum employment and price stability ."
" And, you know, to the extent having r ates low and support for monetary policy broadly, to the extent that raises other questions, we think it ’s absolutely essential to maintain the strength and stability of the —of the  broader financial system and to carefully monitor financial stability quest ions if that ’s what you’ re getting at ."
"So I think that ’s, that’s —you know, monetary policy should be , to me , for, for achieving our macroeconomic aims ."
" Chair man Powell, could you talk to us a little bit about the relationship between the persistent pandemic unemployment and the expected increase in , in inflation ?"
 I was asking if you could talk to us a little bit about the relationship between the persistent pandemic unemployment and the expected increase in inflation .
 You ’re asking about the relationship between unemployment and inflation ?
 If they offset each other— the persistent pandemic unemployment .
 There was a time when there was a tight connection between unemployment and inflation .
" We had extremely low unemployment  in, in—not extremely low."
 We had low unemployment in 2018 and ’ 19 and the beginning of ’20 without having troubling inflation at all.
 We were bouncing around with unemployment 3.5 percent to 4 percent .
 And it wasn ’t just unemployment.
 And we didn’ t see price inflation move up.
 There is a relationship between wage inflation and unemployment .
" But that has not —what , what  happens is that when wages move up because unemployment is low, companies have been absorbing that increase into their margins rather tha n raising prices ."
" So we’re, we ’re not —when , when we —when we  seek to achieve low unemployment, high levels of employment, which is our mandate, you know, we think we have the freedom to do that based on the data without worrying too much about inflation."
" And I wonder if , combined with that , you have an unl eashing of, you know, pentup demand."
 How much do you think that would affect —that would affect  inflation ?
" And from that, you can develop an estimate of the impact on spending, on growth, on hiring, and , ultimately , on inflation ."
" And what , what  it comes down to is what I said before, which is , there very likely will be a step -up in inflation as March and April of last year drop out of the 12month window, because they were very low inflation numbers ."
 That ’s a— that’ll be a fairly significant pop in inflation .
" They won’ t be—they won’t be  able to service all of the demand maybe , maybe  for a period."
 We’ve—and w hat we see is relatively modest increases in inflation .
" And so it ’ll turn out to be a one—a one -time sort of bulge in , in prices, but it won’ t change inflation going forward, because inflation expectations are strongly anchored around 2 percent ."
 We know that inflation dynamics do evolve over time .
" And there was a time when, when inflation went up, it would stay up."
 And they tend to— tend to change when the central bank doesn ’t understand that having inflation expectations anchored at 2 percent is the key to it all .
" If we saw inflation expectations moving materially above 2 percent, of course, we would conduct policy in a way that would, would make sure that that didn’ t happen."
" We’ re committed to having inflation ex pectations anchored at 2 percent, not materially above or below 2 percent ."
" I think it ’s, it’s a relatively unusual —very unusual situation to have all these savings  and this , this  amount of fiscal support and monetary policy support ."
" You know, it ’s a little bit the story about, you know, the wage —the wage  Phillips curve  does show that as unemployment goes down, wages move up."
