" Turning to the broader economy and monetary policy :  Inflation remains too high, and the labor market continues to be very tight."
" My  colleagues and I understand the hardship that high inflation is causing, and we remain strongly committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal."
 Higher interest rates and slower output growth al so appear to be weighing on business fixed investment.
Committee participants generally expect subdued growth to continue.
" As shown in our Summary of Economic Projections, the median projection for real GDP growth stands at just 0.4 percent this year and 1.2 percent next year, well below the median estimate of the longerrun normal growth rate."
 And nearly all participants see the risks to GDP growth as weighted to the downside.
" Job gains have picked up in recent months, with employment rising by an average of 351,000 jobs per month over the last three months."
 The unemployment rate remained low in February at 3.6 percent.
" T he labor force participation rate has edged up in recent months, and wage growth has shown some signs of easing."
" However, with job vacancies still very high, l abor demand substantially exceeds the supply of available workers."
" FOMC participants expect supply and demand conditions in the labor market to come into better balance over time, easing upward pressures on wages and prices."
 The median unemployment rate projection in the SEP rises to 4.5 percent at the end of this year and 4.6 percent at the end of next year.
"March 2 2, 20 23   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 3 of 23   Inflation remains well above our longerrun goal of 2 percent."
" Inflation has moderated somewhat since the middle of last year, but the strength of these recent readings indicates that inflation pressures continue to run high."
" The median projection in the SEP for total PCE inflation  is 3.3 percent for this year, 2.5 percent next year, and 2.1 percent in 2025."
 The process of getting inflation back down to 2 percent has a long way to go and is likely to be bumpy.
"Despite elevated inflation , longer -term inflation expectations appear to  remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets."
 The Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable pri ces for the American people.
" My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship , as it erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportati on."
" We are highly attentive  to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective."
" Since our previous FOMC meeting, economic indicators have generally come in stronger than expected, demonstrating greater momentum in economic activity and inflation."
 It is too soon to determine the extent of these effects and therefore too soon to tell how monetary policy should respond.
" As a result, we no longer state that we anticipate that ongoing rate increases will be appropriate to quell inflation; instead, we now anticipate that some additional policy firming may be appropriate."
" We will closely monitor incoming data and carefully assess the actual and expected effects of tighter credit conditions on economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, and our policy decisions will reflect that assessment."
" These projections  are not a Committee decision or plan; if the economy does not evolve as projected, the path for policy will adjust as appropriate to foster our maximum -employment and price -stability goals."
" We will continue to make our meeting —decisions meeting by meeting, based on the totality of the v incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation."
 We remain committed to bring ing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keep longer -term inflation expectations well anchored.
 Reducing inflation is likely to require a period of below -trend growth and some softening in  labor market conditions.
 Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run.
 We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum -employment and price -stabili ty goals.
" A nd, really , it is that the intermeeting data on inflation and the labor market came in stronger than expected and, really, before the recent events, we were clearly on track to cont inue with ongoing rate hikes."
" We are committed to restoring price stability , and all of the evidence says that the public has confidence that we will do so —that we ’ll bring inflation down to 2 percent over time."
" So we also assess, as I mentioned, that the events of the last two weeks are likely to result in some tightening credit conditions for households and businesses and thereby weigh on demand, on the labor market , and on inflation."
"  I mean , it, it’s possible that this will turn out to have very March 2 2, 20 23   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 7 of 23   modest effects—that these events will turn out to be very, very modest effects on the economy, in which case inflation will continue to be strong —in which case, you know , the path will look —might look differe nt."
" It ’s also possible that this potential tightening will contribute significant tightening in credit conditions over time and, in principle, if that—that means that monetary policy may have less work to do."
" I mean , with our monetary policy, we’re , we’re really focused on macroeconomic outcomes ."
" And, you know , in a way, the early— the data in the first part —the first five weeks of the intermeeting period pointed to stronger inflation and stronger labor market s."
" Y ou know , we know that we have other , other  tools in effect, but no, we think our monetary policy tool works , and we think, you know , many, many banks —our rate hikes were well  telegraphed to the market , and many banks have managed to handle them."
" You mentioned the word “disinflation ,” I believe, 9 or 10 times, a process that you felt was—I forget the word you used—but gratefully under  way , or something like that."
 Is disinflation still occurring in the U.S. today?
" Goods inflation has been coming down now for six months ; it’s proceeding more slowly than we would have liked, but it ’s certainly proceeding."
 We continue to see the new leases being signed at much lower levels of inflation.
" And that is, you know , that ’s just something that will have to come through softening demand and perhaps some softening in labor market conditions ."
" I will say that the inflation data that we got, to your point, really pointed to stronger inflation."
" There ’s a great deal of literature on the connection between tighter credit conditions, economic activity, hiring, and inflation."
" So, at a basic level, Silicon Valley Bank management failed badly—they grew the bank very quickly, they expose d the bank to significant liquidity risk and interest rate risk, didn ’t hedge that risk."
 You ’ve been very consistent in saying that the F ed would be raising interest rates and then holding them there for quite some time.
" So we published an SEP today, as you will have seen, and it shows that basically participants expect relatively slow growth, a gradual rebalancing of supply and March 2 2, 20 23   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 13 of 23   demand in the  labor market, with inflation moving down gradually."
"So, the key is, we have to have —policy has got to be tight enough to bring inflation down to 2 percent over time."
" In the meantime, you know —obviously, at the end of the day, we  will do enough to bring inflation down to 2 percent."
" Inflation has been rather sticky , so do you need help from the fiscal side to get inflation down faster?"
 So—and we will get inflation down to 2 percent in time.
 So it ’s prolonging inflation.
" You have to look at , at the impulse from spending because spending was, of course , tremendousl y high during the pandemic , and then, as the pandemic programs rolled off, spending actually came down, so the —this sort of fiscal impulse is actually not what’ s driving inflation right now."
" It was —it was at the beginning perhaps part of what was driving inflation, but that ’s not really the story now."
" Do you feel , though, that if inflation remains high, you’ ll be able to resume additional hikes as needed , or have you somewhat tied your hands here with these signals about rate hikes coming to an end?"
" We know that can have, you know , an effect on the macroeconomy, on demand, on labor market, on inflation, and we ’re—we’re  going to be watching to see what that is."
 And we ’ll also be watching what ’s happening with inflation and in the labor market.
" So  we’ll be watching all those things , and of course we will —we will eventually get to [a] tight enough policy to bring inflation down to 2 percent."
" Large -scale purchases of long -term securities are , are really meant to alter the stance of policy by pushing down—pushing up the price and down the rates, longer -term rates, which supports demand through channels we understand fairly well."
 The balance sheet expansion is really temporary lending to banks to meet those special liquidity demands created by the recent tensions ; it’s not inte nded to directly alter the stance of monetary policy.
" But , but I will tell you , though, that we have —there have been presentations about , about interest rate risk."
" In the Summary of Economic Projections , the FOMC sees the unemployment rate March 2 2, 20 23   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 20 of 23   increasing to 4.5 percent this year."
 So that ’s just —that’s an estimate of what will happen as demand slows and as conditions soften in the labor market and it ’s just —it’ s a highly uncertain estimate.
" And, I mean, I was r eally —we have to bring inflation down to 2 percent."
" And if you read your history,  as I’m sure you have, you can see that if  the c entral bank doesn’ t get inflation back in place, get inflation —make sure that inflation expectations remain anchored, you can have a long series of years where inflation is high and volatile , and it ’s hard to invest capital, it ’s hard for an economy t o perform well."
" But I guess the question is, historically , it’s hard to —historically , it’s been hard to contain unemployment and I,  I—the question is, do you worry about some sort of snowball effect , and how do you factor that into your projections and your thoughts?"
" We don’ t know —if so, we don’ t know how significant it will be , and so, you know , we’re very focused on getting inflation down because we know in the longer run that that is the thing that will most benefit the people we serve."
" Four of the five longest, or three of the four longest expansions in U.S. history have been really since the high -inflation period."
" And the reason was inflation wasn ’t forcing the c entral bank to come in and stop an incipient or , or, you know , an expansion."
"  You can  have very, very long expansions without high inflation, and we had several of those , and they’ re very good for people."
" You see late in an expansion—you see low unemployment, you see the benefits of wages going to people at the lower  end of the wage spectrum ."
" If credit becomes expensive enough, choking off growth, as you said you’ re watching for, would that situation warrant a rate cut?"
