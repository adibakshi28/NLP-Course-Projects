" Before I go into the details of today ’s meeting, I would like to underscore for the American people that we understand the hardship that high inflation is causing and that we are strongly committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal ."
" Over the course of the year, we have tak en forceful actions to tighten the stance of monetary policy."
" Today, the  FOMC  raised our policy interest rate by ½ percentage point ."
 We continue to anticipate that ongoing increases will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time .
 I will have more to say about today ’s monetary policy actions after briefly reviewing economic developments.
 Recent indicators point to modest growth of spending and production this quarter .
" Growth in consumer spending has slowed from last year ’s rapid pace, in part reflecting lower real disposable income and tighter financial conditions ."
" Higher  interest rates and December 14 , 2022   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 2 of 23   slower output growth also appear to be weighing on business fixed investment ."
" As shown in our Summary of Economic Projections, the median p rojection for real GDP growth stands at just 0.5 percent this year and next, well below the median estimate of the longer -run normal growth rate."
" Despite the slowdown in growth, the labor market remains extremely tight, with the unemployment rate near a 50year low, job vacancies still very high, and wage growth elevated."
" Job gains have been robust, with employment rising by an average of 272,000 jobs per month over the last three months ."
" Although job vacancies have moved below their highs and the pace of job gains has slowed from earlier in the year, the labor market continues to be out of balance, with demand substantially exceeding the supply of available workers ."
" FO MC participants expect supply and demand conditions in the labor market to come into better balance over time, easing upward pressures on wages and prices ."
 The median projection in the SEP for the unemployment rate rises to 4.6 percent at the end of next year.
 Inflation remains well above our longerrun goal of 2 percent .
 The inflation data received so far for October and November show a welcome reduction in the monthly pace of price increases .
 But it will take substantially more evidence to give confidence that inflation is on a sustained downward path.
 Russia’ s war against Ukraine has boosted prices for energy and food and has contributed to upward pressure on inflation.
" The median projection in the SEP for total PCE inflation is December 14 , 2022   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 3 of 23   5.6 percent this year and falls to 3.1 percent next year, 2.5 percent in 2024, and 2.1 percent in 2025; participants continue to see risks to inflation as weighted to the upside."
"Despite elevated inflation, longer -term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters as well as measures from financial markets."
" But that is not grounds for complacency; the lo nger the current bout of high inflation continues, the greater the chance that expectations of higher inflation will become entrenched."
 The Fed ’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the Amer ican people .
" My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship as it erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation."
" We are highl y attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective."
" With today’ s action, we have raised interest rates by 4 ¼ percentage points this year ."
 We continue to a nticipate that ongoing increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time .
" Financial conditions fluctuate in the short term in response to many factors, but it is important that , over time , they reflect the policy restraint that we are putting in place to return inflation to 2 percent ."
" We are seeing the effects on demand in December 14 , 2022   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 4 of 23   the most interest -sensitive sectors of the economy, such as housing ."
" It will take time, however, for the full effects of monetary restraint to be realized, especially on inflation ."
" In light of the cumulative tightening of monetary policy and the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, the Committee decided to raise interest rates by 50 basis points today, a step -down from the  75 basis point pace seen over the previous four meetings ."
 Our decisions will depend on the totality of incoming data and their implications for the outlook for  economic activity and inflation.
We are taking forceful steps to moderate demand so that it comes into better alignment with supply.
 Our o verarching focus is using our tools to bring inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keep longer -term inflation expectations well anchored .
 Reducing inflation is likely to require a sustained period of below -trend growth and some softening of labor market conditions .
 Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run .
" Is this loosening of financial conditions a problem for the Fed in its effort, and its fight , against inflation?"
" So, as I mentioned, it is important that overall financial conditions continue to reflect the policy restraint that we ’re putting in place to bring inflation down to 2 percent ."
" And those, in turn, affect economic activity, the labor market, and inflation ."
" And today we ’re—the SEP th at was published shows again that , overwhelmingly , FOMC participants believe that inflation ris ks are to the upside ."
" Obviously, if data —if the inflation data come in worse, that could move up ."
 And it could move down if inflation data are softer.
" So, as I ’ve been saying, as we’ ve gone through the course of this year, as we lifted off and got into t he course of the year and we saw the— how strong inflation was and how persistent, it was very important to move quickly."
" But, ultimately, that question about how high to raise rates is going to be one that we make looking at our progres s on inflation, looking at where financial conditions are , and making an assessment of whether policy is restrictive enough ."
"And there, the strong view on the Committee is that we ’ll need to stay there, you know, until we ’re really confident that inflation is coming down in a sustained way."
"  If you look at —you can break inflation down into three , sort of , buckets ."
" The first is goods inflation, and we see now, as we ’ve been expecting, really , for a year and a half , that supply conditions would get better ."
" And, ultimately, supply chains get fixed, and demand settles down a little bit and maybe goes back to services a little bit."
 And we start to see goods inflation coming down.
" We know the story there is that housing services inflation has been very, very high and will continue to go up, actually."
" So, once we work our way through that backlog, that inflation will December 14 , 2022   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 8 of 23   come down sometime next year ."
" The third piece, which is something like 55 percent of the index, PCE core inflation index, is nonhousing- related core services."
" And we do see a very, very strong labor market, one where we haven’ t seen much softening, where job growth is very high, where wages are very high."
" Vacancies are quite elevated , and, really, there ’s an imbalance in the labor market between supply and demand."
"The other —you know, the goods inflation has turned pretty quickly now after not turning at all for a year and a half ."
" But there ’s an expectation, really, that the services inflation will not move down so quickly, so that we ’ll have to stay at it, so that w e may have to raise rates higher to get to where we want to go ."
" You describe GDP growth in the SEPs as moderate or modest, I believe ."
 You described labor market unemployment rate as represent ing some softening.
" I don’ t think it would qualify as a recession, though, because you’ ve got positive growth."
" The expectations in the SEP are basically as you said, which is, we ’ve got growth at a modest level, which is to say that December 14 , 2022   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 9 of 23   ½ percentage poi nt, that ’s positive growth."
 It’ s slow growth.
" It’s going to feel like very slow growth, right ?"
 Unemployment does go up a bit.
 I would say that many analysts believe that the natural rate of unemployment is actually elevated at this moment .
 So it ’s not clear that those forecasts of  inflation are really much above the natural rate of unemployment.
" So that we —you know, there are channels through which the labor market can come back into balance with relatively modest increases in unemployment, we believe."
" The decision to step down the pace of rate increase —rate rises appears to have been socialized at your last meeting, largely before the past two CPI reports showed inflation decelerating in line with the C ommittee ’s forecasts this year ."
 I’m wondering if we could talk about the projection for the unemployment rate .
 Why has the F ed raised its unemployment projection?
"  Is it because the model suggests that a higher terminal rate would automatically cause a higher unemployment December 14 , 2022   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 11 of 23   rate?"
" It is more just that, you know, by now, we had expected—we ’ve continually expected to make faster progress on inflation than we have, ultimately."
 You see that —you see the fact that we’ ve made less progress than  expected on inflation.
" And that ’s why unemployment goes up, because we’ re having to tighten policy more ."
" But that ’s the idea , is slower progress on inflation, ti ghter policy, probably higher rates probably held for longer just to get to where you—the kind of restriction that you need to get inflation down to 2 percent ."
" And history would, you know, would say that, in a situation like t his, the declines in unemployment would be more meaningful, I think, than what you see written down there ."
"I mean, I think we ’ve—it feels like we have a structural labor shortage out there wher e there  are, you know, 4 million fewer people, a little more than 4 million who were in the December 14 , 2022   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 12 of 23   workforce available to work than there ’s demand for workforce ."
" And it means that it may take longer, but it also means that the costs in unemployment may be less ."
 How should we interpret the higher core inflation forecast for 2023 in the SEP?
" What you see is our best estimate, as of today—really, as of today—for how high we need to raise rates to— how much we need to tighten policy to create enough, you know, restrictive policy to slow economic activity and slow —soften the labor market and bring inflation down through those channels ."
" I wanted to make sure I understand specifically what ’s going on in the SEP , because you all expect rates to go higher, but you’re also more pessim istic about what inflation is going to look like next year ."
" And I was just December 14 , 2022   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 13 of 23   wondering, you know, given that we have seen some cooling in inflation, you know, is it —is that primarily because of wage growth, that you expect wage growth to be sort of a headwi nd?"
" We’ re going into next year with higher inflation than we had thought, right ?"
" So we’re actually moving down to—the level that we ’re moving down to next year is still a very large drop in inflation from where inflation is running now, well more than 1 percent change in inflation ."
 That would be —that ’s a pretty significant drop in inflation .
" By the middle of next year, we should begin to see lower inflation from the housing services sector ."
" And, you know, that ’s where you need to see —we believe you need to see a better balancing of supply and demand in t he labor market so that you have —it’s not that we don’ t want wage increases."
 We just want them to be at a level that ’s consistent with 2 percent inflation .
" Right now that —if you put into— if you factor in productivity estimates, standard productivity estimates, wages are running, you know, well above what would be consistent with 2 percent inflation ."
" You know, our focus right now is really on moving our policy stance to one that is restrictive enough to ensure a return of inflation to our 2 percent goal over time ."
 I guess I would say it this way:  I wouldn’ t see us considering rate cu ts until the Committee is confident that inflation is moving down to 2 percent in a sustained way.
" I’m wondering if you see that as disinflationary because you’ re seeing supply chains improve or inflationary because it obviously brings a lot more demand globally, improves the  global outlook for growth and for commodities prices ."
 And that could push inflation up in the West .
" You know, we ’ve seen , waves of COVID all around the world can interfere with economic activity ."
 I wondered if you could comment a bit more about yesterday’ s inflation report.
" I mean, it showed inflation cooling in all three of the categories that you laid out at Brookings ."
" As I mentioned in my opening statement, it will take substantially more evidence to give confidence that inflation is on a sustained down ward path."
" And what it does is , it provides greater confidence in our forecast of declining inflation ."
"As I mentioned, we ’ve been expecting significant —forecasting significant declines in overall inflation and core inflation in the coming year ."
" In terms of the pieces, we have been expecting goods inflation to come down as supply chain pressures eased ."
" As long as hous ing—new housing leases show declining inflation, that will show up in the measure around the middle of next year ."
" But we will be looking for wages moving, you know, down to more normal levels where workers are doing well and, ultimately, their gains are not being eaten up by inflation."
" And I ’m wondering if you’ re reacting t o the fact that the markets have loosened financial conditions or if you feel the Fed may be a little bit behind on inflation, whether the recent disinflation we ’re seeing is transitory or not , and how this affects the idea of a soft landing if you’ re projecting just ½ percent growth for this year."
" And, of course, we ’re—we welcome these better inflation reports for the last two months ."
" But we need to be honest with ourselves that there ’s, you know, inflation—12month core inflation is 6 percent CPI ."
" I mean, I would say this:  You know, to the extent we need to keep rates higher and keep them there for longer and inflation, you know, moves up higher and higher, I think that narrows the runway."
" But lower inflation readings, if they persist, in time, could certainly make it more possible ."
" And certainly, you know, lower inflation reports, were they to continue for a period of time, would increase the likelihood of a —put it this way, of a return to price stability that involves significantly less of an  increase in unemployment than would be expected given the historical record."
 How would you describe that to Americans if the projections on unemployment find themselves —that ’d be 1.6 million Americans out of jobs?
" So the largest amount of pain —the worst pain would come from a failure to raise rates high enough and from us allowing inflation to become entrenched in the economy so that the ultimate cost of getting it out of the economy would be very high  in terms of employment, meaning very high unemployment for extended periods of time, the kind of thing that had to happen when inflation really got out of control and the F ed didn’ t respond aggressively enough or soon enough in a prior episode, you know, 50 years ago."
"What we’ re doing now is, you know, it ’s raising interest rates for people ."
" You ’ve reiterated today and the Committee has reiterated its commitment to that 2 percent inflation December 14 , 2022   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 19 of 23   target."
" I wonder, is there ever a point where you actually reevaluate that target and maybe increase your inflation target if it is stickier than even you think it is?"
" That ’s just —so , changing our inflation goal is just something we ’re not thinking about, and it ’s something we ’re not going to think about ."
" It’s—we have a 2 percent inflation goal, and we ’ll use our tools to get inflation back to 2 percent ."
 We’ re going to keep our inflation target at 2 percent .
 We’re going to use our tools to get inflation back to 2 percent .
" As you monitor wage growth and unemployment data, I wonder if you ’re paying close attention to a sector or even income level?"
" That ’s—and all of that because of a tight labor market, a tight labor market which had inflation running, you know, just a tick below 2 percent and the economy growing right at its potential ."
" We look at —it’s our regular practice to talk about unemployment rates by different groups, including racial groups and that sort of thing."
" What would you do if the economy slows so much that we enter a recession before we see strong consistent signs that inflation is slowing—in other words, stagflation?"
 So let me just say that we have to use our tools to support maximum employment and price stability .
" You’re  near a 50 -year low where you’ re at or above maximum emplo yment , a 50year low in unemployment, vacancies are very high, wages —nominal wages December 14 , 2022   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 21 of 23   are very high."
 Where we’ re missing is on the inflation side.
 And we ’re missing by a lot on the inflation side .
" So that means we need to really focus on getting inflation under control, and that ’s what we’ ll do."
" But right now, clearly, the focus has to be on getting inflation down."
" So, what I meant by that, with “ structural labor shortage ,” is, if you look at where we are now, as I mentioned , there —if you just look at demand for labor, you can look at vacancies plus people who are actually working."
 Just assume population and reasonable growth and aging of the population;  our labor force should be 3½ million more than it is .
 You say you expect growth of just ½ percent next year .
" Given that you’ ve said the process of raising rates and getting inflation back under control will be painful , have you had discussions within the Committee and addressed how long and/or how deep of a recession you would be willing to ac cept?"
" And, you know, if you look at those forecasts, those are forecasts for slow growth, for a softening labor market, by which I mean, unemployment goes up but not a great deal."
 And you see inflation coming down.
 You see inflation coming down.
" If you’ re reaching peak rates around 5 percent in the first half of next year and inflation starts to decline materially, that w ould seem to make the real rate gradually more restrictive ."
" But, as I mentioned, you know, we wouldn’ t—I wouldn’ t see the Committee cutting rates until we ’re confident that inflation is moving down in a sustained way."
" It would—really , it’ll be a test of—for cutting rates, I think, in the event , it’ll be a question of , do we actually feel confident that inflation is coming down in a sustained way?"
