 The Committee  also updated its guidance regarding the likely future path of the short -term interest rates.
" As I’ll explain more fully  in a moment, this change in our guidance does not indicate any change in the Committee ’s policy intentions as set forth in its recent statements; rather, the change is meant to clarify how the Committee  anticipates policy evolving after the unemployment r ate declines below 6 ½ percent."
" Despite some softer recent data, the FOMC’s outlook for continued progress toward our goals of maximum employment and inflation returning to 2 percent remains  broadly unchanged."
" The unemployment rate, at 6.7 percent, is three -tenths lower than the data available at the time of the December meeting."
" Further, broader measures of unemployment —such as the U -6 measure, which includes marginally attached workers and those working part time but preferring full -time March 19, 2014  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 2 of 23   work —have fallen even  more than the headline unemployment rate over this period, and labor force participation has ticked up."
Inflation has continued to run below the Committee ’s 2 percent objective.
" Given that longer -term inflation expectations appear to be well  anchored, and in light of the ongoing recovery in the United States and in many economies around the world, the FOMC continues to expect inflation to move gradually back toward its objective."
 The Committee  is mindful that inflation running persistently below its objective could pose risks to economic performance.
" The Committee  also recognizes, however, that policy actions tend to exert pressure on inflation that is manifest only gradually over time."
 The F OMC will continue assessing incoming data carefully to ensure that policy is consistent with attaining the FOMC’s longer -run objectives of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent.
" As always, each participant’s projections are conditioned on his or her own view of appropriate monetary policy."
 The central tendency of the  unemployment rate projections has shifted down by about twotenths since December and now stands at between 6.1 and 6.3 percent at the end of this year.
 The unemployment rate is projected to reach its longer -run normal level by the end of 2016.
 The cent ral tendency of the projections for real GDP growth stands at 2.8 to 3 percent for 2014 and remains somewhat above that of the estimates of longer -run normal growth through 2016.
" Meanwhile, as I noted, FOMC participants continue to see inflation March 19, 2014  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 3 of 23   moving only gradually back toward 2 percent over time as the economy expands."
" The central tendency of the inflation projections is 1.5 to 1.6 percent in 2014, rising to 1.7 to 2.0 percent in 2016."
" These si zable and stillincreasing holdings will continue to put downward pressure on longer -term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and make financial conditions more accommodative, helping to support job creation and a return of inflation to the Committee ’s objective."
" As before, if incoming information broadly supports the Committee ’s expect ation of ongoing improvement in labor markets and inflation moving back over time toward its longer -run objective, the Committee  will likely continue to reduce the pace of asset purchases in measured steps at future meetings."
" However, purchases are not on a preset course, and the Committee ’s decisions about the pace of purchases remain contingent on its outlook for jobs and inflation as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases."
 Today  the FOMC also updated its forward guidance regarding the path of short -term interest rates.
" In December 2012, the Committee  first stated its guidance in terms of economic thresholds , stipulating that the current low range for the federal funds rate target would be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6 ½ percent, inflation is projected to be no more than a half percentage point  above our longer -run goal, and longer -term inflation expectations remain well anchored."
" Since that time, progress in the labor market has been more rapid than we had anticipated, while inflation has been lower than the Committee  had expected."
" Although the thresholds served well as a useful guide to policy over the past year, last December the FOMC judged it appropriate to update that guidance, noting that the current target range for the federal funds rate would likely be maintained “well past the time that the unemployment rate declines below 6½ percent, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee ’s 2 percent longer -run goal.”  Today  the Committee  has fur ther revised its forward guidance to better reflect conditions as they now stand and are likely to evolve over coming quarters."
 The revised formulation starts with a general description of the factors that drive FOMC decisionmaking and then provides the FOMC’s current assessment of what those factors will likely imply for the future path of short -term interest rates.
" In particular , the Committee  states that “[ i]n determining how long to maintain the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate, it [the Committee] will assess progress—both realized and expected —toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.”   In short, the larger the shortfall of employment or inflation from the respective objectives set by the FOMC, and the longer any such shortfall is expected to persist, the longer the target federal funds rate is likely to remain in the present 0 to ¼ percent range."
" March 19, 2014  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 5 of 23   The FOMC will base its ongoing assessment on a wide range of information , including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments."
" The Committee  continues to anticipate that conditions will likely warrant maintaining “the current range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends , especi ally if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee ’s 2 percent longer -run goal, and provided that longer -term inflation expectations remain well anchored .” The FOMC also supplemented its guidance pertaining to the period after the asset purchase program ends and the initial increase in the federal funds rate target has occurred."
" The statement now adds the Committee ’s current anticipation that  “even after employment and inflation are near mandateconsistent levels, economic conditions may, for some t ime, warrant keeping ” short -term interest rates “ below levels the Committee  views as normal in the longer run.”  This guidance is consistent with the paths for appropriate policy as reported in the participants’ projections, which show the federal funds ra te for most participants remaining well below longer -run normal values at the end of 2016."
" Although FOMC participants provide a number of explanations for the federal funds rate target remaining below its longer -run normal level, many cite the residual impacts of the financial crisis, and some note that the potential growth rate of the economy may be lower, at least for a time."
" March 19, 2014  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 6 of 23   In summary, the Committee ’s actions today reflect its assessment that progress in the labor market is continuing, but that much re mains to be done on both the jobs and inflation fronts."
" Unemployment is still elevated, underemployment and long -term unemployment remain significant concerns, and inflation is running significantly below the FOMC’s objective."
" The Federal Reserve’s interest rate guidance and its substantial and still -increasing holdings of longer -term securities will ensure that monetary policy remains highly accommodative, promoting the FOMC’s objectives of maximum employment and price stability."
"  And could you also address the concerns raised in the dissent that by dropping this , it lowers the commitment on fighting low inflation?"
" But it is becoming —as the unemployment rate gets closer and closer to 6½ percent , to breaching that threshold tha t seems like the one that is likely to be breached ."
" March 19, 2014  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 7 of 23   So the purpose of this change is simply to provide more information than we have in the past, even though it is qualitative information , about what we will be looking at as the unemployment rate declines below 6½ percent in deciding how long to hold the federal funds rate at this 0 to ¼ percent range."
 We initially started  with an unemployment rate as a threshold.
" That was easy enough for the Committee  to say , “With an unemployment rate above 6½ percent, we know we’re not close to full employment, not close to an employment level consistent with our mandate, and unless inflation were a significant concern, we wo uldn’ t dream of raising the federal funds rate target."
"”  Now, the Committee  has never felt that the unemployment rate is a sufficient statistic for the labor market."
" I think if I had to choose one indicator of the labor market, the unemployment rate is probably as good a  one as I could find."
" And that indicates that it’ s unlikely to be back to normal levels for some  time , but he questions whether or not the  reformulated forward guidance shows March 19, 2014  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 8 of 23   sufficient commitment of the Committee  to its 2 pe rcent inflation objective."
" And I will simply say on my own behalf , and on behalf of the Committee , that we are fully committed to the 2 percent inflation objective , and we do not want to undershoot inflation for a prolonged period of time."
" As I mentioned, monetary policy operates with lags , so, the policies we have in place, we think, will gradually —only gradually —move inflation back to 2 percent ."
" But if the Committee  had real concerns that inflation were going to remain persistently below 2 percent, I feel confident that the Committee  would act to prevent that."
" Chair Yellen , in the interest rate projections made by FOMC participants that supplement your statement, there seems to be a slight upward drift in the expectations for rates going out to 2016."
" A s I mentioned, unemployment has come down."
" Looking further out, let ’s say if you look toward the end of 2016 when most participants are projecting that the employmen t situation —that the unemployment rate will be close to their notions of mandate -consistent or  longer -run normal levels."
" So, just so I understand correctly, it mea ns that once you hit the longer -run unemployment rate of 5—which is the central tendency  average of being 5.4 per cent—once you get a 2 percent inflation rate, the market should not , then , anticipate the longer -run 4 percent fed funds rate, a nd that woul d be question one."
" Yes, I think it does suggest a shallower glide path, and what the Committee  is expressing here, I would say , is its forecast of what will be appropriate some years from now ba sed on its —the understanding that we ’ve developed about what are the economic forces that have been driving economic activity."
  We’ve had a series of years now in which growth has  proven disappointing.
" N ow, members of the Committee  have different views about why this is likely to be true , that the funds rate—when the labor market is normalized and inflation is back to our objective —they maybe have slightly different views on exactly why it ’s likely to be the case that interest rates  will be a little lower than they would in the longer run."
"  But the general assessment is that even after we’ve had an accommodative monetary policy for long enough to get the economy back on track in the sense of meeting our objectives, the stance of policy that will be appropriate to accomplish that will be easier or involve somewhat lower than would be normal short -term interest rates."
" You mentioned in your testimony on Capitol Hill recently that the Fed was trying to assess the balance of weather effects versus more fundamental  weakness in the economy as the reason for the slowdown in growth in the first quarter , and you guys mentioned in the statement weather specifically."
" Does that mean that the Fed’s analysis has come down on the side  of weather, or are you still concerned t hat there could be something else going  on that could be contributing  to slower growth ?"
 And you guys also lowered your forecast for GDP growth this year .
" So , I’d say , certainly  the analysis that we’ ve done —and we did spend a lot of time discussing weather  and how it ’s affected businesses and households in various parts of the country —certainly weather has played an important role in weakening economic activity March 19, 2014  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 12 of 23   in Q1."
" It’s not the only factor that is at work, and most proje ctions for growth in the first quarter are reasonably weak ."
" Madam Chair, given  that the new qualitative guidance doesn’ t give any information about how you will trade  off your unemployment and inflation objectives, does it a ctually give us any information?"
  How will you trade off the risk of higher inflation versus faster  progress on unemployment as you get closer to full employment?
" So, I’d say so far we haven ’t had that tradeoff to make because inflation is r unning well below our objective, a nd by any measure there remains substantial slack in the labor market."
" As we get closer to meeting our goals , it could become an element, a nd I would say that we ’ve given guidance in the statement —and we gave perhaps more guidance in our socalled consensus  statement or statement of longer -run goals and mon etary policy strategies that we ’ve now reaffirmed for three years in a row —that the Committee  would take a balanced approach in situations where our objectives conflict and we ’re faced with tradeoffs between inflation and unemployment."
"  When we first put our thresholds into effect, we envisioned a possible situation where such a tradeoff could arise, where we might fa ce a situation where unemployment was quite high—namely , over 6½ percent —and inflation might be drifting close to 2  or even a little bit above 2."
 And our thresholdbased guidance gave some more concrete indication that we would tolerate inflation running a little bit over 2 percent with unemployment sufficiently high before moving the federal funds rate off zero.
" But I would point you to the statement —the final statement in th is statement that says that the FOMC does not see this guidance as indicating any change in our policy i ntentions , and I would include how we would make tradeoffs between our inflation and employment objectives if we were to face that situation."
" We need to see where the labor market is, how close are we to our full employment goal —that will be a March 19, 2014  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 15 of 23   complicated assessment not just base d on a single statistic —and how rapidly are we moving toward it ?"
"  And then, what the statement emphasizes , and this is the same language we used in December and January,  we used the language especially if inflation is running below our 2 percent objective."
" Inflation matters here , too, and our general principle tries to capture that notion."
" If we have a substantial shortfall in inflation, if inflation is persistently running below our 2 percent objective , that is a very good reason to hold the funds rate at its present range for longer."
" And, secondly , if I may, there ’s a lot of research showing that short -term unemployment seems to be responsible for the level of inflation and that long -term unemployment seems relatively uncorrelated."
 Is that one reason that you expect inflation to rebound in the next couple of years?
 The first is that we need to assess that the labor market continues to be on the mend and that we feel reasonably satisfied that the outlook is for further improvement in  the labor market that will get us back to our maximum employment objective.
" And , second of all, we March 19, 2014  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 16 of 23   need to see— and now coming back to inflation again—inflation is low , and it ’s been running well below our objective."
" And we need to see evidence that leaves us feeling satisfied that inflation will move up over time, that we believe the evidence is consistent with its moving up over time ."
 But I would want to feel confident in making those two statements about the labor market and inflation.
"  With respect to the issue of short -term unemployment and its being more relevant for inflation and a  better measure of the labor market, I ’ve seen res earch along those lines."
 I think it would be tremendously premature to adopt any notion that says that that is an accurate read on either how inflation is determined or what constitutes slack in the labor market.
" So I think this is something our Committe e will be looking at, especially as unemployment goes down and other labor market indicators hopefully simultaneously improve."
 You’ve spoken in the past about —thinking about back to March of la st year —of how you supplement your view of the labor market beyond unemployment with other gauges like qui t rates and lay offs and things like that.
" In addition to the standard unemployment rate, I certainly look at broader  measures of unemployment."
" It—5 percent of the labor force working part time on an involuntary basis, that ’s an exceptionally high number relative to the measured unemployment rate, and it—so, to my mind, is a form of slack that is —adds to what we see in the normal unemployment rate and is unusually large."
" The share of long -term unemployment has been immensely high and can be very stubborn in bringing down, that’s something t hat I watch closely ."
"  The final thing I ’d mention is wages , and wage growth has really been very low."
" I know there is perhaps one isolated measure of wage growth that suggests some uptick, but most measures of w age increase are running at very low levels."
" In fact, with the productivity growth we have and 2 percent inflation, one would probably expect to see , on an ongoing basis , something between—perhaps 3 and 4 percent wage inflation would be normal."
 Wage inflation has been running at 2 percent.
" An increase in  it might signal some tightening or meaningful pressures on inflation, at least over time."
 And monetary policy has tried to do what we can to offset that.
" I’d like to take you back to last summer when there were hints —the Fed made hints that they were going to taper, and long -term interest rates spiked, mortgage rates rose."
" I think it ’s probably true that monetary policy may have played a role  in touching off that market reaction, but I think the market reaction was exacerbated by the fact that we had a very significant unwinding of carry trades  and other leveraged positions that investors had taken, perhaps thinking that the level of volatilit y was exceptionally low and perhaps lower than was safe for them to have assumed."
" But we certainly saw —now, in some ways, the fact that term premia in interest rates have come up somewhat, although it has had a negative effect on the recovery and that ’s evident in housing —in the slowdown in housing —perhaps it ’s diminished some financial instability risk that may have been associated with these carry trades and speculative activities that were unwinding during that time."
" A lesson is that we will try, and w e March 19, 2014  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 20 of 23   were trying then, but we will continue to try to communicate as clearly as we possibly can about how we will conduct monetary policy and to be as steady and determined and as transparent as we can to provide as much clarity as is reasonably certain —given  that the economic developments in the economy are themselves uncertain —but we will try as hard as we can not to be a source of instability here."
" One of  the drivers last spring and summer of home prices and home sales  was that sense  that interest rates were going up, that they were spiking ."
" And now, a year later, we ’re looking essentially at a flat interest rate picture as far as homebuyers are concerned ."
" And if I ’m a buyer, and I ’m thinking about going out and buying a home, why should I do that today as opposed to waiting a few more years or even months before interest rates then do go up?"
" Well, I think the level of interest rates remains low by historic levels."
" And what we ’ve not ye t seen—the  pickup after the lull—after interest rates went up last summer, I do expect housing activity to begin to expand more rapidly later on."
" And, you know, as I indicated,  I—my goal, and I will, you know, throw myself into this as wholeheartedly as I can, is to make rapid progress, as rapid progress as we possibly can in getting this recovery back on track and putting Americans back to work and into jobs, and in moving inflation back up to levels at the Committee ’s target of 2 percent."
 You ’ve spoken about how unemployment is more than just statistics to you.
" Well, I ’d be surprised if anyone in this room doesn’ t know someone who has been touched by the crisis, by unemployment, by difficulties in getting jobs, and that  is true of me and my family and friends, I think, as it is probably for many of you."
