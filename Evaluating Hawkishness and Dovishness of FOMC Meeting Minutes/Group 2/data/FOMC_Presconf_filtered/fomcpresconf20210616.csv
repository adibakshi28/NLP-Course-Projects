" At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed to achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us:  maximum employment and price stability."
 Today the Federal Open Market Committee kept interest rates near zero  and maintained our asset purchases.
" These measures, along with our strong guidance on interest rates and on our balance sheet, will ensure that monetary policy will continue to deliver powerful support to the economy until the recovery is complete."
" Indicators of economic activity and employment have continued to strengthen, and real GDP this year appears to be on track to post its fastest rate of increase in de cades."
 Much of this rapid growth reflects the continued bounceback in activity from depressed levels.
 F orecasts from FOMC participants for economic growth this year have been revised up since our March Summary of Economic Projections.
" As with overall economic activity, conditions in the labor market have continued to improve, although the pace of improvement has been uneven."
" Employment rose 419,000 per month, on average , in April and May, with the leisure and hospitality sector continuing to post notable gains."
" Employment in th is sector and the economy as a whole remains well below pre -June 16, 2021    Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 2 of 30  pandemic levels."
" The unemployment rate remained elevated in May at 5.8 percent, and this figure understates the shortfall in employment, particularly as participation in the labor market has not moved up from the low rates that have prevailed for most of the past year."
" Factors related to the pandemic, such as caregiving needs, ongoing fears of the virus, and unemployment insurance payments , appear to be weighing on employment growth."
" These factors should wane in coming months against a backdrop of rising vaccinations, leading to more rapid gains in employment."
" Looking ahead, FOMC participants project the labor market to continue to improve, with the median projection for the unemployment rate st anding at 4.5 percent at the end of this year and declining to 3.5 percent by the end of 2023."
 Inflation ha s increased notably in recent months .
" These bottleneck effects have been larger than anticipated, and FOMC participants have revised up their projections for, for inflation notably for this year."
" As these  transitory supply effects abate, inflation is expected June 16, 2021    Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 3 of 30  to drop back toward our longerrun goal, and the median inflation projection falls from  3.4 percent this year to 2.1 percent next year and 2.2 percent in 2023."
" As the reopening continues, shifts in demand can be large and rapid, and bottlenecks, hiring difficulties, and other constraints could continue to limit how quickly supply can adjust, raising the possibility that inflation could turn out to be higher and more  persistent than we expect."
" Our new framework for monetary policy emphasizes the importance of having wellanchored inflation expectations, both to foster price stability and to enhance our ability to promote our broadbased and inclusive maximum -employme nt goal."
 Indicators of longerterm inflation expectations have generally reversed the declines seen earlier in the pandemic and have moved into a range that appears broadly consistent with our longerrun inflation goal of 2 percent.
" If we saw signs that the path of inflation or longer -term inflation expectations were moving materially and persistently beyond levels consistent with our goal, we ’d be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy."
"The Fed’s policy actions have been guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to promot e the stability of the financial system."
" As the Committee reiterated in today’s policy statement, with inflation having run persistently below 2 percent, we will aim to achieve inflation June 16, 2021    Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 4 of 30  moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longerterm inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent."
 We expect to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these employment and inflation outcomes are achieved.
" With regard to interest rates, we c ontinue to expect that it will be appropriate to maintain the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessment of maximum employment and inflation ha s risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time."
" In addition, we are continuing to increase —continuing to increase  our holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency mortgage -backed securities by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward our maximumemployment and price -stability goals."
 This technical adjustment has no bearing on the appropriate path for the federal funds rate or stance of monetary policy .
 Any barriers that you see in keeping people from the labor market as you consider full employment going into 2023?
" So I would say, if you look at the labor market and you look at the demand for workers and the level of job creation and think ahead, I think it ’s clear , and I am confident , that we are on a path to a very strong labor market —a labor market that , that  shows low unemploym ent, high participation, rising wages for people across the spectrum."
" Finally, unemployment insurance for something like 15 million people will either end or be diminished as we move through the summer and into, into, into the fall by the end of September , and I’d lik e some —that may also encourage some to go back in and take jobs."
" It ’s not a time to try to reach hard conclusions about the labor market, about inflation, about the path of policy."
" Your—the Committee’s median forecast on inflation seems to assume a pretty, pretty tame outlook for the rest of the year."
 So inflation has come in above expectations over the last few months.
" But if you look behind the headline numbers, you’ll see that the incoming data are , are consistent with the view that prices —that prices  that are driving that higher inflation are from categories that are being directly affected by the recovery from the pandemic and the reopening of the economy."
" Another example where we haven ’t seen that yet is prices for used cars, which accounted for more than a third of the total increase in core inflation."
 Used car prices are going up because of sort of a perfect storm of very strong demand and limited supply.
" But over time, it seems June 16, 2021    Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 9 of 30  likely that these very specific things that are driving up inflation will be —will be temporary."
" I’ll , I’ll also say that the labor market is going to be important, both for the maximum -employment goal, but also for inflation."
" So I , I can ’t give you an exact number or an exact time, but I would say that we do expect inflation to move down."
" If you look at the —if you look at the  forecast for 2021 and—sorry, 2022 and 2023 among my colleagues on the , on the Federal Open Market Committee, you will see that people do expect inflation to move down meaningfully toward our goal."
" And I think the fu ll range of, of, of inflation projections for 2023 falls between 2 and 2.3 percent , which is consistent with our—with our goals."
" Well, you mentioned—let me ask about inflation expectations."
 And are we only looking at longerterm inflation expectations?
" And on a related note, would the F ed consider publishing its index of common inflation expectations on a monthly basis?"
" So we , we do tend to look at the longerterm inflation expectations, because that ’s really, we think, what matters for, for inflation."
" So you’ll see if gasoline prices were to spike, you’ll see the shorter -term inflation expectation measures, particularly the surveys, move up."
" And , and that’s, that’s  maybe not a good signal for future inflation if, if gas happens to spike and then go back down again."
" June 16, 2021    Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 11 of 30  So we—ye s, I think if, if you look at the broad range of longerterm inflation expectations, they’ve moved up."
" They moved down during the beginning of the pandemic, you know, sort of further exacerbating concerns that we might find ourselves where, for example, the ECB and the Bank of Japan have been , where you have expectations and inflation itself sliding down and you have a really hard tim e stopping that process once it begins."
" So it ’s, it’s good, actually , to see inflation —longerterm inflation expectations move back up to a range —it’s a range that ’s consistent with what our objectives are."
" And , by the way, they’ve  been broadly higher than that, somewhat modestly higher than that, not so many years ago, at a time when inflation was , was, was still anchored at around 2 percent  or maybe even a little bit below."
" And, you know, as you know, it ’s, it’s fundamental in our framework, our new framework, to, to assure that inflation—longerterm inflation expectations are anchored at a place that is consistent with our goal."
" If, if inflation expectations are not anchored at a place that ’s consistent with your goal, it ’s not clear why you would expect to hit your goal over the  longer term."
" Your economic projections today forecast 7 percent growth in 2022, unemployment at 4½ percent , and core inflation of 3 percent ."
" And kind of more broadly, when you look at the sort of median forecast for interest rates in 2023 showing not one but two interest rate increases at the time, I mean, is this kind of—can you describe the sort of tone of the —of the  discussion in the Committee?"
" And , as I mentioned, it ’s labor market conditions consistent wi th maximum employment, inflation at 2 percent  and on track to exceed 2 percent ."
" The conditions for liftoff—we ’re very far from maximum employment, for example."
" If I were a businessman looking at the forecast today, I would ask how and when the F ed seeks to achieve an average of 2 percent  inflation."
" Or does it plan to suppress inflation in outer years because , over the next three years , you’re going to be above inflation?"
" And if June 16, 2021    Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 15 of 30  they don’t, why isn’t this just flexible inflation targeting without an average in a range of 2 to 2¼ percent ?"
" You know, it says that we will seek  to—seek  inflation that runs moderately above 2 percent  for some time."
" And it’s, it’s meant to create a broad sense that we want inflation to average 2 percent  over time."
" I was wondering if you could follow up a little bit on your response to Rachel at the very beginning and talk a little bit about how we should understand what full employment means in a world that, as you mentioned, is pretty roiled."
" So I guess I wonder what full employment means in this context and , and sort of how you’re thinking about those wage data."
" We look at a range of indicators, and it ’s a very broad range, you can count to a high number just quickly—but , but, certainly, it will include things like unemployment and participation and wages and many different flavors of that."
" So I think we ’re—I think that  lesson number one is , is just to be careful about assessing maximum employment."
" And I think if you—during the last cycle, there were —there were waves of concern that we were reaching full employment as early, June 16, 2021    Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 18 of 30  you know, as , as 2012, when I arrived at the Fed."
" And what we ’re seeing is —we don’t see anything that ’s troubling in the sense of—what would be troubling would be, you know, very wide across the economy, wages at unsustainable levels without high inflation."
" In other words, wages in excess of productivity and inflation, you know, by a meaningful amount broadly across the economy, sort of forcing companies to keep raising prices and getting into a wage –price cycle."
" That’s, that’s  the old formula for—one of the old formulas for having high inflation."
" And, but we , we do think—you’ve got to—you’ve got to think in the labor market right now, where , where  supply and demand are just not matched up well."
 There will —there will be a level at which supply and demand meet.
" But there ’s June 16, 2021    Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 19 of 30  every reason to think that we ’ll be in a —in a  labor market with very attractive numbers, with low unemployment, high participation, and rising wages across  the spectrum."
 Is the Fed  still thinking about ways to permanently adjust this to account for the high growth in deposits?
 And it looks like we ’re at the beginning of suppliers catching up with demand.
" So , really, the problem now is , is that demand is very, very strong."
" Demand for goods is extremely high, and it hasn ’t—it hasn’t  come down."
" But in terms of, of overcorrecting, I mean, I think there , there  is a possibility on the other side of this tha t, that  inflation could be—could actually be quite low going forward."
" Our  focus right now is , we need to —our, our expectation is that these , these  high inflation readings that we ’re seeing now will start to abate."
" I think in terms of the timing and the effects on inflation in the near term, there ’s a lot of uncertainty."
" And the risk would be that over time, it does begin to affect inflation expectations."
" And if we see inflation expectations and inflation—or inflation moving up in a way that is really materially above what we —what we  would see as consistent with our goals, and persistently so, we wouldn’t hesitate to use our tools to address that."
" So is this the June 16, 2021    Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 22 of 30  effective end , in your view , of the pandemic as a constraint on economic activity, even though it’s still cited as a risk?"
" If I could follow up on that, if you—if you view this statement in , in toto  and the —and the  dots and the substance as well, do you think this is more a markto -market exercise around the improvement in health or around the inflation risks you see developing out there?"
 We ’ve seen growth coming higher than we expected.
 We’ve seen very strong labor demand.
" We ’ve also seen —we have seen inflation above target, though, and I think even though, you know, in, in our forecasters ’ case, they do see inflation coming back down over ’22 and ’23 into, into  areas that are very consistent with our—with our mandate."
" Nonetheless, the risk is , is something that can factor into people ’s thinking about appropriate monetary policy."
" I, I want ed to ask a little bit more about inflation to make sure I understand how you’re thinking about this."
" So in the projections, inflation is expected to , to be high this year and then come back down next year and then maybe start to rise a little bit again, enough for a liftoff in 2023."
 But that would suggest that you all could theoretically see inflation sustainably staying above 2 percent .
" And so, I guess my question is, what would be causing that inflation?"
" What , what  would be —because it seems like you all now see a situation in which inflation would be rising in a way that isn’t caused by transitory factors in the —in the  next couple of years."
 Would that be because this whole situation has raised people ’s inflation expectations?
" When, when you get to— in, in the forecast, all of that, you know, supply and demand sides of the economy adapt."
" And by 2023, those increases are really about, about, you know, rising resource utilization or, to put it a different way, you know, low unemployment, or high employment is a way to think about it."
" That’s about the kind of broad inflationary pressure that results from, you know, a really strong expansion tightening up resource utilization across the whole economy and lifting, lifting  up inflation."
" So the , the, the  change in the projections reflect the fact that you all are more optimistic about the economic outlook, and not necessarily that you think that this will change the way people think about inflation?"
" Yeah, I think—there may be an element of the latter as well, because inflation expectations have continued to move up."
" But it w ouldn’ t surprise me if there ’s an element for some people in, you know, seeing the inflation performance that we ’ve had  and thinking that I have more confidence that we could see inflation above 2 percent , that it may not be as hard to do that as we thought, and that inflation expectations may move up to a —to a  level —they were —they were  really at a level that was kind of a little below 2 percent ."
" Yo u know, we did see inflation expectations moving June 16, 2021    Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 25 of 30  up in the —in the  wake of the announcement of the framework."
" I mean, are we looking at a scenario of a slowing economy next year with higher inflation?"
" So —but you’ve , you’ve  still got a very strong growth, well above the longerrun potential output of the —of the  economy."
" You ’ve got —you’ve got  growth meaningfully above that, and inflation is lower next year in all of our—in all of our forecasts ."
" So you’re right, you’re seeing —I, I can’t remember the number, but it might be in the 3s —3, 3½ percent growth for next year."
" That ’s, that’s  a really good year—coming on the back of a 7 percent growth year, t hat’s a really good year."
 We didn’ t have a 3½ percent growth year—w e didn’ t have a 3  percent growth year between the G lobal F inancial Crisis and the end of the expansion.
" If you’re growing above that, then the unemployment rate should be declining, people should be be ing pulled into the labor force, wages should be going up, lots of things should be happening, businesses should be investing."
" So, you know, I guess to answer your question a different way, is there a risk that inflation will be higher than we think?"
 And therefore we don’t —we don’t  think that —we think it ’s unlikely that they would materially affect the underlying inflation dynamics that the economy has had for a quarter of a century.
" The underlying forces around the globe that have created those dynamics are intact, and those are aging population, low productivity, globalization, all of those things that , that  we think have, have, you know, really held down inflation."
" Nonetheless, is there a ri sk that inflation will remain higher than we —than we thought?"
" And if, if we see inflation moving above our goals in, in a time—sorry, to an extent, to a level or, or persistently —or persistently enough, you know, we would be prepared to use our tool s to address that."
" On that point, you talked about maybe some of the more structural changes in that last answer with regards to productivity."
" I noted that the median projection for r*, the longerterm interest rate, is still the same at 2.5  percent ."
" But there ’s been some literature out there that maybe the COVID crisis June 16, 2021    Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 27 of 30  could have actually changed some of the underlying fundamentals of the economy and maybe changed productivity, in addition to combined with demographic changes that have already been in effect to suggest that that longerterm neutral rate or r* might be higher."
 What would the implications of that be for monetary policy?
 A higher neutral rate would mean that interest rates would run higher by that amount.
" The problem with , with  interest rates being close to the lower bound, of course, is that it really cuts into our ability to react to a downturn—for example, a pandemic."
" You know, there are many—there are a lot of stories right now that could —that essentially could lead to higher productivity growth and higher r*."
" One is that the new policy framework is that you react to actual data and do not react to forecasts, yet the actual inflation data is coming in hot and you’re relying on the forecast that it will cool down in order to make policy."
" And , finally, you’ve said the Fed  knows how to combat inflation, but raising rates also slows the economy."
" The situation that we, we  addressed in June 16, 2021    Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 29 of 30  our—in our S tatement on L ongerRun G oals and M onetary P olicy S trategy was a situation in which employment was at very high levels, but inflation was low."
" And what we  said was, we wouldn’t raise interest rates just because unemployment was low and employment was high if there was no evidence of inflation or other troubling imbalances."
"  In the current si tuation, we have many millions of people who are unemployed, and we have inflation running well above our target."
 The question we face with this inflation has nothing to do with our framework.
" And that is, how do you separate in inflation—how do you separate things that , that  follow from broad upward price pressures from things that really are a function of, of sort of idiosyncratic factors in a particular —due to particular things?"
" If you raise rates to control inflation, you also slow the economy."
" And we —look, we have to balance the two —the two  goals:  maximum employment and price stability."
" But when we —when we  raise interest rates to control inflation, there ’s no question that has an effect on activity."
 And that ’s the channel —one of the channels through which we get to inflation.
" It turns out it ’s a heck of a lot easier to create demand than it is to, you know, to bring supply back up to snuff."
" But  we’re going, you know, we’re going to watch carefully to make sure that , that  evolving inflation and our understanding of what ’s happening is , is, is  right."
