" The labor market has continued to improve, with gains in private payroll employment averaging about 200,000 jobs per month over the past six months."
" However, at 7.6 percent, the unemployment rate remains elevated, as do rates of underemployment and long -term unemployment."
 Inflation has been running below the Committee ’s longer -run objective of 2 percent for some time and has been a bit softer recently.
" The Committee believes that the recent softness partly reflects transitory factors , and with longer -term inflation expectations remaining stable, the Committee expects inflation to move back towards  this 2 percent longer -term objective over time."
" As always, each participant ’s projections are conditioned on his or her own view of appropriate monetary policy."
" Generally, the projections of individual participants show they expect moderate growth, picking up over time, and gradual progress towards  levels of June 19, 2013  Chairman Bernanke ’s Press Conference  FINAL  2 of 28   unemployment and infl ation consistent with the Federal Reserve ’s statutory mandate to foster maximum employment and price stability."
"  In brief , participants ’ projections for economic growth have a central tendency of 2.3 to 2.6 percent for 2013, rising to 2.9 to 3.6 percent i n 2015."
" The central tendency of their projections of the unemployment rate for the fourth quarter of this year is 7.2 to 7.3 percent, declining to 5.8 to 6.2 percent in the final quarter of 2015."
 Most participants see inflation gradually increasing from its current low level toward the Committee ’s longer -run objective; the central tendency of their projections for inflation is 0.8 to 1.2 perce nt for this year and 1.6 to 2.0 percent for 2015.
" While participants continue to think that, in the long run, the Federal Reserve ’s portfolio should consist predom inantly of Treasury securities, a strong majority now expects that the Committee will not sell agency mortgage -backed securities during the process of normalizing monetary policy, although in the longer run, limited sales could be used to reduce or elimina te residual MBS holdings ."
" With unemployment still elevated and inflation below the Committee ’s longer -run objective, the Committee is continuing its highly accommodative policies ."
" As you know, in normal times, the Committee eases monetary policy by lowering the target for the short -term policy interest rate, the federal funds rate."
"  First, today the Committee reaffirmed its expectation that the current exceptionally low range for the funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6½ percent so long as inflation and inflation expectations remain well behaved in the senses described in the FOMC statement ."
" As I have noted frequently, the phrase “ at least as long” in the Committee ’s interest rate guidance is important."
" For example, assuming that inflation is near our objective at that time, as expected, a decline in the unemployment rate to 6½ percent would not lead automatically to an increase in the federal funds rate target, but rather would indicate only that it was appropriate for the Committee to consider whether the broader economic outlook justified such an increase ."
" All else equal, the more subdued the outlook for inflation at that time, the more patient the Committee would  likely be in making that assessment ."
" Moreover, so long as the economy remains short of maximum employment, inflation remains near our longer -run objective, and inflation expectations remain well  anchored, increases in the target for the federal funds rate, once they begin, ar e likely to be gradual, consistent with the Committee ’s balanced approach to meeting its employment and price stability objectives ."
  The purpose of this forward guidance about policy is to assure households and businesses that monetary policy will continu e to support the recovery even as the pace of economic growth and job creation picks up.
" Going forward, the economic outcomes that the Committee sees as most likely involve continuing gains June 19, 2013  Chairman Bernanke ’s Press Conference  FINAL  5 of 28   in labor markets, supported by moderate growth that picks up over the next several quarters as the near -term restraint from fiscal policy and other headwinds diminishes ."
 We also see inflation moving back toward our 2 percent objective over time .
" In this scenario, when asset purchases ultimately come to an end, the unemployment rate would likely be in the vicinity of 7 percent, with solid economic growth supporting further job gains, a substantial improvement from the 8.1 percent unemployment rate that prevailed when the Committee announced this program ."
" Indeed, should it be needed, the Committee would be prepared to employ all of its tools, including an increase in the pace of purchases for a time, to promote a return to maximum employment in a context of price stability ."
 These large and  growing holdings will continue to put downward pressure on longer -term interest rates .
" I hate to use my question to ask you to clarify something, but when you said gradually reduce purchases, beginning later this year and ending it next year when the unemployment rate hits  7 percent —what is that?"
" Is that the unemployment rate coming down by itself to 7 percent , or are there other factors involved, and is it “ substantial ” compared to the fall?"
" As you know, we look at participation, payrolls, a variety of other data , but the 7 percent unemployment rate is indicative of the kind of progress we ’d like to make in order to be able to say  that we ’ve reach ed substantial progress."
" For instance, the unemployment rate forecast comes down to 6.5 to 6.8 percent next year ."
" It’s the case that the Fed has overestimated the economy ’s growth rate very often in the past during this recovery, so —and we ’ve gone through a period in the first half of the year with pretty subdued growth."
" In particular, the housing sector, which has been a drag on growth since the crisis , is now, obviously, a support to growth."
" The main drag , or the main headwind , to growth this year is , as you know, is the federal fiscal policy, which the CBO estimates is something on the order of 1 ½ percentage points of growth."
" But we ’re hopeful, as you can see from the individual projections —and again, these are individual projections, not an official forecast of the C ommittee —we ’ll be obviously very interested to see if the economy does pick up a bit and continue to reduce unemployment, as we anticipate."
" And could you talk a little bit about whether that rise in bond yields and interest —longer -term interest rates could affect your economic outlook and, particularly , given that  mortgage rates are  now back up above  4 percent , if that could affect the recovery under  way in the  housing market?"
" So, yes, our forecast —our projections do factor that in, and if interest rates go up for the right rea sons—that is , both optimism about the economy and an accurate assessment of monetary policy —that ’s a good thing ."
" Mr. Chairman, you ’ve always argued that it ’s the stock of ass ets that the Federal Reserve holds which affects long -term interest rates ."
" How do you reconcile that with a very sharp rise in real interest rates that we’ ve June 19, 2013  Chairman Bernanke ’s Press Conference  FINAL  10 of 28   seen in recent weeks?"
" So, I ’m agreeing with you that it seems larger than can be explained by a changing view of monetary policy ."
" Well, Ylan, we just spent two days working on monetary policy issues , and I would like to keep the debate, discussion, the  questions here on policy ."
 The forecast and the mysterious dots kind of don’ t map into the unemployment forecast .
" People moving to the right, at least one person, on when  they expect the rate to increase, and yet, unemployment ’s going to fall to  6.5 percent in 2014."
" I also note that labor force participation isn ’t in that great shape, and you, in fact , have been a big believer that a lot of the exit from the workforce is related to weak demand, not structural factors ."
" And I ’ll point out that the V ice C hair and two other people who used to work here have done significant research on, maybe you need to let the employment rate fall much lower to pull these people back into the labor force ."
" In other words, when we get to that point, we will then at that point begin to, you know, look at whether an increase in rates is appropriate , and among the things we would take into account , first of all , is inflation, and infla tion obviously is very low and expected to stay low ."
" Secondly, we would be taking into account , does that unemployment rate fairly represent in some sense the state of the labor market ?"
" And, as you pointed out, we have underemployment , part -time work, pe ople leaving the labor force, reduced participation, longterm unemployment, a number of factors which suggest that maybe th e 6.5 percent is a little bit—not exactly representative of the state of the labor market at that point ."
" People are saying that unemployment will be at 6.5 in late 2014 or  early 2015, but the y’re saying that increases  in rates may not follow but several quarters after that ."
 The employment rate ’s been at the same level for three years now .
 I think going from 8.1 percent and a stagnant rate of improvement to 7 percent and stronger economic growth is a substantial increase.
" And then, essentially , to allow the low interest rate policy which—to carry us through."
" The first is, our target is not 7, it ’s not 6½, our target is maximum employment, which , according to our projections , most people on the C ommittee think is somewhere between 5 and 6 percent unemployment , and that ’s where we’ re trying to get to ."
" And if the  stock theory of the portfolio is correct , which we believe it is, holding all of  those securities off of the market and reinvesting and still keeping the , you know, rolling -over maturing securities, w ill still continue to put downward  pressure on interest rates ."
" And so, between our commitments to a low federal funds rate and  the large portfolio, we will still be producing a very large amount of stimulus —in our view , enough to bring the economy smoothly towards full employment without incurring unnecessary costs or risks."
" You, in your statement be fore the press conference and in the policy statement, acknowledge that inflation readings have been low ."
 But you maintain that inflation expect—longer -term inflation expectations have remained stable.
" What would you need to June 19, 2013  Chairman Bernanke ’s Press Conference  FINAL  14 of 28   see for the C ommittee to start being more concerned that longer -term inflation expectations are , in fact, falling?"
" There are a number of, as I mentioned in th e statement, there are a num ber of transitory factors that may be contributing to the very low inflation rate ."
 So these are some things that we expect to  reverse and we expect to see inflation come up a bit .
" But, first, on inflation expectations, it is true that the breakevens from the inflation -adjusted —inflation -index ed bonds have come down."
" And moreover, other measures of inflation expectations , be it forecast s by professional forecasters, whether it ’s survey measures from firms or households, those are all still pretty much in the same places they we re."
" And one of the preconditions for the policy path that I described is that inflation begin , at least gradually , to return towards our 2 percent objective ."
" And we are certainly determined to keep inflation not only —we want to keep inflation near its objective , not only avoiding inflation that ’s too high, but we also want to avoid inflation that ’s too low."
" A number of your colleagues , as reflected in the new SEP  projections , expect the unemployment rate to get down to 6½ percent next year , which is your threshold for considering raising the f unds rate ."
" Well, I certainly hope the unemployment rate comes down so fast  that this becomes a problem ."
" So that ’s not inconsistent, that ’s just saying that people are looking at a variety o f factors , including inflation , which is predicted to be quite low, and other perhaps labor market factors in  thinking about when it ’ll be appropriate to start increasing rates."
" But again, our basic forecast is one which is basically , as was pointed out earlier by Mr. Hilsenrath, a moderately optimistic forecast, where growth picks  up as we pass through this period of fiscal restraint; where un employment continues to fall at a gradual pace as it has been since last September —and we have made som e progress since last September ; and inflation rises slowly towards 2 percent ."
" Aga in though, it ’s very important to understand that that’ s—if we do that, that would basically say that , you know , that we ’ve had a relatively decent economic outcome in terms of sustained improvement in growth and unemployment ."
" We do believe —although, you know, there ’s room for debate —we do believe that the primary effect of our purchases is through the stock that we hold, because that stock has been withdrawn from markets , and the prices of those assets have to adju st to balance supply and demand."
" Mr. Chairman, I ’m trying to sort of understand the view with rela tion to these inflation  figures ."
" Inflation looks remarkably low on both core and headline, PCE  and CPI ."
" You say that inflation expectations have remained sort of within the range that the Fed has  traditionally  been comfortable with , but they have fallen by a good ½ percentage point ."
" And , as y ou know , that when interest rates are stuck at the zero lower bound, a decline in inflation expectations sort of  translates into an increase in real rates ."
" It seem s to me that earlier in the  recovery, they were more concerned about declines in  inflation like this ."
" And wouldn’ t you say that , even if you ’re happy with the pace of labor market recovery, th at, other things equal, this sort of inflation performance suggest s that you should be pushing harder on the acceler ator."
 I think low —inflation that’ s too low is a problem .
 It raises real interest rates .
" And so we expect inflation to come back up, that ’s our forecast ."
" W e would like to get inflation up to our target , and that will be a factor in our thinking about the thresholds ."
" And, you know, we ’ve got a dual mandate, and it ’s maximum employment and price stability ."
" And there’ s a reason why we define price stability as a positive inflation rate, not zero, because we believe that in order to best maximize the mandate, we need to have enough inflation so that there is , in fact, you know, some room for real interest rates to move ."
" Inflation as a whole is subdued, but oil prices are —anchor ed somewhere around $99—$93 to $99."
 Brazil has got people on the streets be cause of inflation.
" And we argued at the time that the effect s of the Federal Reserve’ s policy on global commodity prices was probably pr etty small , and that it operated —to the extent it did have an effect —it operated through growth—mos tly through growth expectations ."
" But many other commodity prices have fallen further, and the reason I would give for that is that the emerging markets —China, the rest of Asia , and some other parts of the worl d—plus Europe , of course , are softer , and so global commodity demand is weaker ."
" In terms of wages, I think that ’s mostly consistent with our view that unemployment , at 7.6 percent , is still pretty far from where we should be satisfied ."
" Maximum employment, we think, is , again , between 5 and 6 percent , although these are very difficult numbers to estimate ."
" June 19, 2013  Chairman Bernanke ’s Press Conference  FINAL  25 of 28   So, very weak wage growth, except in a few places and a few narrow occupation s, is indicative to me of a  labor market that remains quite slack and where, you know, that justifies , I think—together with low inflation —justifies why we are maintaining a highly accommodative  policy."
" Some say this volatility is  due to un certainty to the Federal Reserve ’s monetary policy direction , but other s say this is due to lack of confidence to the Bank of Japan ’s monetary  policy ."
" And , of course, deflation has been a problem in Japan for many, many years , which means that expectations are very much —the public ’s expectations are for continuing deflation, and therefore it takes very aggressive policies to break those expectations  and to  get inflation up to the 2 percent target that the Bank of Japan has set ."
 Some of them have to do with changes in growth expectations .
" For example, we ’ve seen a lot of changes in growth patterns in the emerging markets recently ."
" Some of it has  to do with riskon, riskoff behavior , and some of it probably does have to do with monetary policy in  advanced economies , which include s, of course , the United States ."
"monetary policy , like that of Japan , is trying to do is trying to help this economy grow ."
" And a global recovery, a global —strong global growth depends very much on the U .S."
