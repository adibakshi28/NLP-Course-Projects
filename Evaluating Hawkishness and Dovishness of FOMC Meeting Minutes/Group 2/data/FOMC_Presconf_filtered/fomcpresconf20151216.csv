" Room for further improvement in the labor market  remains, and inflation continues to run below our longerrun objective."
" But with the economy performing well and expected to continue to do so, the Committee judged that a mode st increase in the federal funds rate target is now appropriate, r ecognizing that  even after thi s increase, monetary policy remains accommodative."
" As I will explain, the process of normalizing i nterest rates is likely to proceed gradually, although future policy actions will obviously depend  on how the economy evolves relative to our objec tives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation."
 The labor market has clearly show n significant further improvem ent toward our objective of maximum employment.
" The unemployment rate, at 5 percent in November, is dow n 0.6 percentage point from the  end of last year and is close to the median of FOMC participants’ estimates of its longerrun no rmal level."
 A broader measure of unemployment that includes i ndividuals who want and are avai lable to work but have not actively searched recently and pe ople who are working part time  but would rather work full time also has shown solid improvement .
" That said, some cyclical wea kness likely remains:  The labor force participation rate is st ill below estimates of its demogr aphic trend, involuntary parttime employment remains somewhat el evated, and wage growth has yet t o show a sustained pickup."
 The improvement in employment conditions this year has occurred  amid continued expansion in economic activit y.
"  The Committee currently expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will continue to expand at a  moderate pace and labor market indicators will continue to strengthen."
" Although developments abroad still pose risks to U.S.  December 16, 2015 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL  Page 3 of 26  economic growth, these risks app ear to have lessened since last  summer."
" Overall, the Committee sees the risks to the outlook f or both economic activity and th e labor market as balanced."
 The anticipation of ongoing economic  growth and additional impr ovement in labor market conditions is an importa nt factor underp inning the Commi ttee’s confidence that inflation will return to our 2 percent objective over the medium term.
 O verall consumer price inflation—as measured by the price index for personal consumption expendi tures—was only ¼ percent over the 12 months ending in October.
 The appreciation of the d ollar has also weighed on inflation by holding down import prices.
" As th ese transitory influences fade and as the labor market strengthens further, the Committ ee expects inflation to rise to  2 percent over the medium term."
  The Committee’s confidence in  the inflation outlook rests impor tantly on its judgment that longerrun inflation expecta tions remain well anchored.
" Marketbase d measures of inflation compensa tion remain near historically low levels, although the declines i n these measures over the pa st year and a half may reflect changes in risk and liquidity pr emiums rather than an outright decline in inflati on expectations."
" Our statement emphasizes that , in considering future policy dec isions, we will carefully monitor actual and expected progre ss toward our inflation goal."
" Participants’ p rojections for real GDP growth are little cha nged from the projections made in  conjunction with the September  December 16, 2015 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL  Page 4 of 26  FOMC meeting."
" The median projec tion for real GDP growth is 2.1  percent for this year and rises to 2.4 percent in 2016, somew hat above the median estimat e of the longerrun normal growth rate."
" Thereafter, the  median growth projection declines  toward its longerrun rate."
" The median projection for the unemploym ent rate in the fourth quart er of this year stands at 5 percent, close to the median estimate of the longerrun norma l unemployment rate."
 Committee participants generally see the  unemployment rate declining a li ttle further next year and then leveling out.
" The path of the med ian unemployment rate is slig htly lower than in September, and while the median longerrun normal  unemployment rate has not ch anged, some participants edged down their estimates."
" Final ly, FOMC participants project  inflation to be very low this year, largely reflecting lower  prices for energy and nonenergy  imports."
" As the transitory factors holding down inflation abate and labor market conditions contin ue to strengthen, the median inflation projection rises fro m just 0.4 percent this year to 1 .6 percent next year and reaches 1.9 percent in 2017 and 2 percent in  2018."
 The path of the med ian inflation projec tions is little changed from September.
" With inflation currently still lo w, why is the Committee raisin g the federal funds rate target?"
" As I have already note d, much of the recent softness i n inflation is due to transitory factors that we expect to abat e over time, and diminishing slac k in labor and product markets should put upward pressure on inf lation as well."
" In addition, we recognize that it takes time for monetary policy actions to affect  future economic outcomes."
" We re the FOMC to delay the start of policy normalization for t oo long, we would likely end up ha ving to tighten policy relatively abruptly at some point to keep t he economy from overheating and  inflation from significantly overshooting our objective."
"   December 16, 2015 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL  Page 5 of 26  As I have often noted, the importa nce of our initial increase i n the target range for the federal funds rate should not be  overstated:  Even after today’ s increase, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting further improv ement in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percen t inflation."
 One indication that the neutral funds rate is unusually low is that U.S. economic growth has been only mod erate in recent years despite the very low level of the federal f unds rate and the Federal Reserv e’s very large holdings of longerterm securities.
 The marked decline in the neutral federal funds rate may be par tially attributable to a range of persistent economic h eadwinds that have weighed on agg regate demand.
" Following the financial crisis, these headwinds  included tighter underwriting  standards and lim ited access to credit for some borrowers, de leveraging by many households to r educe debt burdens, contractionary fiscal policy, w eak growth abroad coupled with a  significant appreciation of the dollar, slower productivity and labor force growth, and elevate d uncertainty about the economic outlook."
  This view is implicitly reflected in participants’ projections of appropriate monetary policy.
" As the factors restrain ing economic growth continue to fade over time, the median rate rises to 3¼ percent by the end of 2018, close to its longerrun normal level."
" I’d like to underscore that the forecasts of the appropriate pa th of the federal funds rate, as usual, are conditional on partic ipants’ individual projectio ns of the most likely outcomes for economic growth, employment and i nflation, and other factors."
" Stronger growth or a more rapid increase in inflation than we currently anticipate would suggest that the neutral federal funds rate was rising more quickly than expecte d, making it appropriate to raise the federal funds rate more quick ly as well."
" Specifically, the Board of Gov ernors raised the interest rate paid on required and excess reserves to ½ percent , and the FOMC authorized overn ight reverse repurchase operations at an offering rate  of ¼ percent."
" Why were you delaying?”  So, I’ll ask, given de velopments around the world t hat still—there is still weakness, and the inflation is still nowhere near your target."
" We decided to move a t this time because we feel the conditions that we set out for a move—namely, furth er improvement in the labor market and reasonable confidence that inflation woul d move back to 2 percent over the  medium term—we felt that these conditions had been satis fied."
" And while there is a drag from net exports, from relatively wea k growth abroad, and the apprec iation of the dollar, overall, we decided today that the risks t o the outlook for the labor marke t and the economy are balanced."
 It—monetary policy remains accommodative.
 We  have indicated that we will be watching what happens very c arefully in the economy in terms  of our actual and forecast—our projected conditions relative to our employment and inflati on goals and will adjust policy over time as seems appropriate t o achieve those goals.
" You wanted the unempl oyment rate to fall, you wa nted inflation to rise, and it was easy for the public to judge the  success or failure of your pol icy."
" The Committee forecasts that the  unemployment rate will continu e to decline, and I think that’s important and appropriate for tw o reasons."
" First of all, as I’ ve indicated, I continue to judge that there remains slack in the econom y, margins of slack that are n ot reflected in the standard unemployment rate, and, in partic ular, I’ve pointed to the depr essed level of labor force participation and also the somewhat abnormally high level of pa rttime employment."
" But also we want to see infla tion move up back to our 2 percent objective over the medium term , and so seeing abovetrend growt h and continuing tightness—greater tightness in labor and pr oduct markets—I think that wil l help us achieve our objective as well with respect to inflation."
" We ha ve considered the risks to th e outlook and worried about the fact that with interest rates at zero, we have less scope to re spond to negative shocks than to positive shocks that would call for a tightening of policy."
" B ut we recognize that policy  is accommodative, and if we do not begin to slightly reduce the amount of accommodation, the odds are good that the economy would end up overshooting both our employment and inflation obj ectives."
" So to keep the econom y moving along the growth path  it’s on with improving and solid conditions in labor marke ts, we would like to avoid a sit uation where we have left so much accommodation in place for so long that we overshoot these obje ctives and then have to tighten abruptly and risk damaging—damaging that performance."
" In the sentence in your statement about g radual increases, in that sec tion, the Committee says that it “will carefully monitor” progress—actual and expected progress on inflation."
" And, speci fically, with  regard to what you do next, do you need to see inflation actuall y rise at this point in order to raise interest rates again?"
" The entire Committee is comm itted to achieving our 2 percent in flation objective over the  December 16, 2015 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL  Page 11 of 26  medium term, just as we want to make sure that inflation doesn’ t persist at levels above our 2 percent objective."
 The Comm ittee is equally committed—this i s a symmetric goal—and the Committee is equally committed t o not allowing inflation to per sist below our 2 percent objective.
" Nevertheless, that is a forecast, and w e really need to monitor over time actual inflation performance to m ake sure that it is conforming , it is evolving, in the manner that we expect."
" So it doesn’t mean t hat we need to see inflation re ach 2 percent before moving again, but we have expectations for how  inflation will behave."
" And we have indicated that we’ re reasonably close—not quite the re, but reasonably close—to achieving our maximum em ployment objective, but we hav e a significant shortfall on inflation."
"  Not necessarily get to the 2 percent goal, but in orde r to move again, do you want to see inflation measures actually moving higher?"
 I’m not going to gi ve you a simple formula for w hat we need to see on the inflation front in order t o raise rates again.
 We’ll al so be looking at the path of employment as well as the pat h for inflation.
" But if incoming data were—led us to call into  December 16, 2015 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL  Page 12 of 26  question the inflation forecast that we have set out, and that could be a variety of different kinds of evidence, that would certainly give the Committee pause."
" We—you know, the C ommittee expects inflation —over the next year, the median expectation is for in flation to be running about 1.6 per cent, and—both core and headline."
" The way the Com mittee describes inflation—well , there’s this “transitory” language."
" So, my question:  What will you be willing to do if you don’t see  progress toward 2 percent  inflation?"
" And, second, would you allow inflation to bounce around betw een 2 and 3 percent the way you’ ve allowed it to move under 2 percent over the past several years?"
" First, let me say w ith respect to oil prices, I have been surprised by the further downward movement  in oil prices, but we do not need  to see oil prices rebound to higher levels in order for the impact on inflation to wash out."
" For a number of years between 2004 and 2008, we had a s eries of increases in oi l prices that for a series of years raised inflation above—again, we  didn’t have a 2 percent object ive then, but—raised it above 2 percent, and we judged those incr eases to be transitory as we ll and looked through them."
 We do monitor inflation expectations  very carefully.
" If we saw in  a meaningful way that inflation expectations were either movi ng up in a way that made it—them s eem unanchored or down, that would be of concern."
" We are watchi ng that, but I still judge that inflation expectations are reasonably well anchored."
" So, yes , we have tolerated inflation  shortfalls that we thought would disappear over the medium term j ust as we did overshoots of inf lation that we also judged to be transitory."
" But we do need to mon itor inflation very carefully  because if energy prices and the dollar were to stabilize, impor t prices, our expectation is tha t both headline and core inflation would move up."
" Well, you know, if the economy were disappointin g, we—you know, our actions wouldn’t purely be  based on inflatio n, we would als o take employment into account."
" Well, there are num ber of different channels thr ough which monetary policy is transmitted to spending decisions."
" The behavior of l ongerterm—longerterm interest rates, shortterm interest rate s matter."
" The value of asset pr ices and the exchange rate, also—these are transmission channels."
" Expectations about Fed policy have been built into the str ucture of financial market p rices, but we obviously will track carefully the behavior of both s hortand longerterm interest rates, the dollar, and asset prices, and if they move in persistent a nd significant ways that are ou t of line with the expectations that we have, then of course we will take those into account."
" In the event of  an outcome like that, in the m ost negative of scenarios, are there other polic y measures outside of interest rates, outside of traditional quantitative easing, that you ins ide of the Fed have discussed and contemplated for another environment like something whic h we saw throughout the Great Re cession?"
" Obviously, we lowered our  overnight interest rate effectively to zero."
" And, you know, individual investors and institutions hol d trillions of dollars of these b onds, which were sold heavily  December 16, 2015 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL  Page 18 of 26  because of low rates, and did the  Fed’s low interest rate polic y help lay—sow the seeds for this development?"
So we continue to believe that f inancial conditions are support ive of economic growth.
" So, whe n you say that central banks often kill t hem, I think the usual reason that that has been true wh en that has been  true is that central banks have begun too late to tighten policy, and they’ve allowe d inflation to get out of con trol."
" And at that point, they have had to tighten policy very abrupt ly and very substantially, and  it’s caused a downturn, and the downturn has served to lower  inflation."
" S o, in thinking about their labor market prospects and their financial prospects going forw ard, I hope they will take this d ecision as one that signals the FOMC’s confidence that conditions will continue to strengthen a nd job market prospects will be good."
 Longerterm interest rates—loans that  are linked to longerterm intere st rates are unlikely to move—to move very much.
  How concerned are you with interest rate risk in banks now that you ’ve obviously ended the zerorate era and began the 0.25 percent–rate  era?
 Interest rate ris k at banks is something that we  have been monitoring very carefully for quite a long time.
 The community banks and smaller banking organizations that we work with—part of our supe rvision has been ensuring tha t they manage appropriately for interest rate risk.
" You keep  saying that the things holding back inflation are t ransitory, and yet every day  there seems to be new impulses from outside that look that they  could drive prices lower."
" I g uess my question is, if in a year’s time inflation remains where i t is today, would you see that as  a defeat for your theory?"
" If we—if we an alyze inflation data and conclude that, clearly, transitory inf luences are holding down inflation , I do not want to say that we would respond to that."
" But if we concl uded that there were structura l factors or that there were a problem with our theory or some gl obal deflationary force that were simply persistently holding down inflation in a way that was  not transitory —and I don’t wan t to attach any simplistic meaning to what we would need to s ee to conclude that in the in flation data, but if we concluded that, we certainly would take ac tion to make sure we adjusted p olicy so that we attain our 2 percent objective."
" Well, starting wit h the median CPIs, we look at a range of statistics that bear on the inflation outl ook, and the median CPI has been  somewhat more stable and running closer to 2 percent than t he PCE, but there is a system atic gap between these two measures, and our objective is 2 per cent on the PCE price index , and so there’s no simple translation."
" T he global economy—we tend to focus—there are many countries t hat are undergoing very difficu lt adjustments or slowing growth, especially with declini ng commodity prices."
" But even r ecently, we’ve seen growth in emerging markets strengthe n."
" I do want to e mphasize that while we have said “gradual,” gradual doe s not mean mechanical, evenly t imed, equally sized interest rate changes."
" You just mention ed that it may be possible that structural f actors are holding down inflation as well, and the dynamic that’s happening in topline inflation i s happening in core as well."
" Additionally, markets see much  lower inflation in the future than central bank models do."
" Well, so the reas on—the main reason that we revi sed down our projection ever so slightly—it’s  hardly revised f or core inflat ion—is because we have seen further appreciation of the dolla r that’s holding down import p rices that spills over into core inflation."
" I mean, my own estim ation is that core inflation wi ll pick up."
" There are various idiosyncratic factors that affect  core inflation—for example, n onmarket price increases, which are a little bit hard to underst and, have been running at a slo w pace."
" There were factors that have  December 16, 2015 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL  Page 24 of 26  been affecting inflation in medi cal care prices that may change  over time."
 But I pe rsonally don’t think we’re in a  world where inflation is being determined in a different way t han it has historically.
 Monetary policy is based on economic forecasts.
"  Whether it’s consumer spending or residential invest ment or inflation, the underlying  theories are not perfect, and they are subject to uncertainty."
" I’m not aware, I will say, of a different model of inflation that would be superior  to the one that we employ."
" Bu t we have to verify that inflation is moving in the manner that we e xpect, and if it’s not, we need t o adjust policy accordingly."
  Wage growth is not quite whe re you would like it to be— CHAIR YELLEN.
 How much is that going t o play into your thinking next yea r as you’re trying to decide whether to raise interest rates more and when?
" So my expectation i s that in a strengthening lab or market that we would see faster wage growth, and I  believe there is, with the 2 percent inflati on objective, space for wage growth to be higher th an it’s been."
 We may be seeing some incipient signs of faster wage growth.
" Wag e growth is not—there are ma ny factors that affect it—it’s not definitive in any sense i n determining our policy, but it d oes have a bearing on the inflation outlook."
" It also has a beari ng on assessing how much slack the re is in the labor market, and I think a number of my colleagues looking at the slow pace of wag e growth have—you’ve seen that their estimates of the longerrun normal unemployment rate  have come down."
"  So, you know, it does affect views about just how much slack there i s in the labor market and the inflation outlook."
