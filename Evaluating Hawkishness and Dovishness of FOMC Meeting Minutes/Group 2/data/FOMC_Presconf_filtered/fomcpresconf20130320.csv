 The data since our January meeting  have been generally consistent  with our expectation that the fourth -quarter pause in the recovery w ould prove temporary  and that moderate economic growth w ould resume.
" The jobs market has  also shown signs of improvement  over the past six  month s or so :  Private payrolls are growing more quickly , total hours of work have increased, the  rate of filings of  new claims for unemployment insurance has fallen , and the unemployment rate has continued to tick down."
  The Committee also remains concerned  that restrictive fiscal policies may  slow economic growth and job creation in coming months.
" Importantly , longer -term inflation expectations remain stable ."
" Overall, stillhigh unemployment , in combination with relatively low inflation , underscores the need  for policies that will support progress toward s maximum employment in a context of price stabi lity."
" March 20, 2013  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL   2 of 26 As always, each participant’s projections are conditioned on his or her own view of  appropriate monetary policy."
" To summarize, the participants’  projections for economic growth ha ve a central tendency of 2.3 to 2.8 percent  for 2013, rising to 2.9 to 3.7 percent  in 2015."
 M ost participants see inflation  gradually increasing toward the  Committee’s longer -run target; the central tendency of their projections for inflation is  1.3 to 1.7 percent this year and 1.7 to 2.0 percent in 2015.
"  Although estimates  of the efficacy of the Federal Reserve’s asset purchases are necessarily uncertain, most participants agreed that these purchases —by putting downward pressure on longer -term interest rates, including mortgage rates —continue to provide meaningful support to economic growth and job creation."
"  Second , the Committee kept the target for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent  and reaffirmed its expectation  that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy  will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens ."
" In particular, we  anticipate that this exceptiona lly low range  for the funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6½ percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half  percentage point above the Committee’s longer -run infl ation goal of 2 percent, and longer -term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored ."
" This guidance will help market participants assess how th e Federal Reserve’s interest  rate policy is likely to respond to economic developments, but its broader purpose  is to assure households and businesses that monetary policy will continue to support the recovery even as the pace of economic growth and job creation picks up."
"  As always, in deciding on the appropriate stance of policy, t he Committee will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer -run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent."
"   In sum, the Committee  anticipates moderate economic growth, supported by household and business spending and a strengthening housing sector."
" T he labor market has shown signs of March 20, 2013  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL   5 of 26 improvement in recent months, but the  unemployment rate remains elevated ."
" Inflation is expected to  remain low , and fiscal policy has become somewhat more restrictive."
" I would say that we ’ll be looking for sustained March 20, 2013  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL   6 of 26 improvement in a range of key labor market indicators, including , obviously , payrolls, unemployment rate, but also others like the hiring rate, claims for unemployment insurance, quit rates, wage rates, and so on."
 And since we ’re looking at the outlook—we ’re looking at the prospects rather than the current state of the labor market — we’ll also be looking at things like growth to try to understand whether there ’s sufficient momentum in the economy to pr ovide demand for labor going forward.
" Well, you know, as I just described what I mean by “substantial improvement,”  it’s a broad -based improvement in a range of indicators as well as improvement in output and  labor demand."
" For example, let ’s say , theoretically , we did 236,000 jobs in a month, and the unemployment rate fell by 0.2 percent ."
 Unemployment rate  has come down four -tenths since September.
" Unemployment claims, insurance claims are at the lowest level they ’ve been since the crisis, so we are seeing improvement."
 And you’ve seen that there ’s political stress in terms of trying to figure out how they ’re going to meet the demands of the euro group for contributing to their rescue.
" You see some discrimination among different institutions according to the bond market —interest rates that they get charged , and so on."
" Last time I was there, the unemployment rate was about 15 percent."
" So I think it ’s very, very important that we act to address unemployment , and I think the Federal Reserve— I think most people would agree —the Federal Reserve has been fairly active in that regard."
" Clearly, financial in stability , if it were allowed to be sufficiently serious , would be a threat to employment, a threat to jobs , and a threat to production."
" Looking at the level for credit scores  for new home loans rising into the 700s —is that something you would consider to be a successful transm ission of monetary policy , and the —especially given how well the Fed says that banks are capitalized ?"
 That does have some effect on monetary policy.
 We’re still at 7.7 percent unemployment.
" We’re measuring success in terms of our mandate, wh ich is employment and price stability , and that ’s what we’ re trying to achieve."
" And if you adjust for inflation and for the growth of the economy, you know, we ’re still some distance from the high."
 How much of a drag o n growth do you see from the Social Security tax increase and the across -theboard spending cuts that went into effect on March 1?
" And they estimate that putting together all the fiscal measures , including the f iscal c liff deal,  the s equester, and other cuts, that federal f iscal restraint in 2013 is cutting something like 1½ percentage points off of growth, which, of course, is very significant."
" That being said, as I ’ve said many times, monetary policy cannot offset a fisca l restraint of that magnitude , and so the final outcome will be wors e—or, in terms of jobs —than would have been the case with less fiscal restraint."
" You —they have reduced the projected rate of unemployment, but , at the same time , lowered the growth forecast."
" There’ s been some disconnect , at least in the sh ort run , between unemployment rate changes and March 20, 2013  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL   17 of 26 growth during this recovery, and there ’ve been periods , at least , where unemployment has fallen relatively quickly even though growth has been more limited."
 You ’re right that we ’re not forecasting extraordinarily strong growth.
" But it is also true , as you —I think, you noted, that our projections for unemployment in the fourth quarter are noticeably lower than they were i n September when we first announced this asset purchase program."
"  And , normally, you would expect that you would need to see a reasonable pace of GDP growth in order to achieve that."
" But you didn’ t under the merely adverse scenario , which featured a n inflation shock followed by a quick rise in short -term rates."
" For example, we have used some of our work to look at interest  rate risk and interest rate sensitivity  and, you know, found generally that banks can also sustain a significant increase in long -term interest rates as well for a number of reasons, one of them being that higher interest rates increase their franchise value because it increases their net interest margin over time."
" We could lower even further , say, the unemployment rate number that we hit."
" But for right now, we find that the thresholds that we have put into that rate guidance seem to be sufficient to approx imate the —what ’s called the optimal c ontrol path of i nterest r ates, that it seems to give a path of unemployment and inflation that ’s about as good as we can get with the monetary policy tools that we have."
 It just means that we don’ t have enough fire power to get the economy back to full employment more quickly.
" I guess I’ m not —given the concerns about unconventional policy relative to normal interest rate policy, is there a feeling that more should be done so that when  the next potential recession rolls around, we have more room to cut rates, or are you comfortable just using th ese threshold policies on an ongoing basis?"
" So you’ re talking about the inflation target, basically."
" So , historically, the argument for having inflation greater than zero —we define price stability as 2 percent inflation , as do most central March 20, 2013  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL   20 of 26 banks around the world."
" And one might ask, “Well, price stability should be zero inflation."
"”  And the answer  is, the question you’ re raising , which is that if you have zero inflation, you’ re very close to the deflation zone , and nominal interest rates will be so low that it would be very difficult to respond fully to recessions."
" And so, historical experience has  suggested that 2 percent is an appropriate balance between the cost of inflation and the cost that you’ re referring to."
" There ’s a lot more demand for risk sharing, for liquidity services , and so on."
" Would you be in favor of reducing the flow of stimulus if we had another month or two, as we did in February , of job growth and the unemployment rate dropping, but the long -term unemployed didn’ t change much?"
 Long -term unemployment is one dimension of the unemployment problem.
" And I think that ’s—we ’d be looking at the overall key indicators like overall unemployment rate, payrolls and hiring, and some of the other things that I mentioned."
" But I doubt that , in the near term at least , that we ’ll see an increase in labor force participation because— besides the effects of the slow recovery, high unemployment , we’ve had  a downward trend in the U .S., which is not due to the recession , it’s due to underlying demographic factors."
 You argued in a 1999 paper and a 2002 speech that monetary policy was not the right tool for addressing asset bubbles.
"  Well, I still believe the following , which is that monetary policy is a very blunt instrument."
" If you are raising interest rates to pop an asset bubble, even if you were sure you can do that, you might , at the same time , be throwing the  economy into recession , which kind of defeats the purpose of monetary policy."
" And then, in addition, we try to use communication and similar tools to a ffect the way that financial markets respond to monetary policy."
" That being said, you know, I think that given the problems that we’ ve had —not just in the United States, but globally in the last 15, 20 years —that we need to at least take into account these issues as we make monetary policy."
" I think if the economy is in very weak condition and interest rates are very low for that purpose, it ’s very difficult to contemplate raising rates a lot because you ’re concerned about some sector in the financial sphere."
