 I will begin with one overarching message :  We at the Fed understand the hardship that high inflation  is causing .
" We are strongly committed to bringing inflation back down, and we ’re moving expeditiously to do so."
 It is essential that we bring inflation down if we are to have a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all.
" From the standpoint of our c ongressional mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability, the current picture is plain to see:  The labor market is extremely tight, and inflation is much too high."
" Overall economic activity edged down in the first quarter, as unusually sharp swings in inventories and net exports  more than offset continued strong underlying demand."
" Recent indicators suggest tha t real GDP growth has picked up this quarter, with consumption spending remaining strong."
" In contrast, growth in business fixed investment appears to be slowing, and activity in the housing sector looks to be softening, in part reflecting higher mortgage rates."
 The tightening in financial conditions that we ’ve seen in recent months should continue to temper growth and help bring demand into better balance with supply.
" As shown in our Summary of June 15, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  Page 2 of 27   Economic Projections, FOMC participants have marked down their projections for economic activity, with the median projection for real GDP growth running below 2 percent through 2024."
"The labor market has remained extremely tight, with the unemployment rate near a 50year low, job vacancies at historical highs, and wage growth elevated."
" Over the past three months, employment rose by an average of 408,000 jobs per month, down from the average pace seen earlier in the year but still robust."
" Labor demand is very strong, while labor supply remains subdued, with the labor force participation rate little changed since January."
" FOMC participants expect supply and demand conditions in the labor market to co me into better balance, easing the upward pressures on wages and prices."
" The median projection in the SEP for the unemployment rate rises somewhat over the next few years, moving from 3.7 percent at the end of this year to 4.1 percent in 2024, levels that  are noticeably above the March projections."
 Inflation remains well above our longerrun goal of 2 percent.
" Aggregate demand is strong, supply constraints have been larger and longer lasting than anticipated, and price pressures have spread to a broad range of goods and services."
 The surge in prices of crude oil and other commodities that resulted from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is  boosting prices for gasoline and food and is  creating additional upward pressure  on inflation.
" FOMC participants have revised up their projections for inflation this year, particularly for total June 15, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  Page 3 of 27   PCE inflation given developments in food and energy prices."
 P articipants continue to see risks to inflation as weighted to the upside.
 The Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.
" My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant  hardship, especially on those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and tra nsportation."
" We are highly attentive to the risks high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective ."
 And we are continuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet —which plays an important role in firming the stance of monetary policy.
 We also stated that we were highly attentive to inflation risks and that we would be nimble in responding to incoming data and the evolving outlook.
" Since then, inflation has again surprised to the upside, some indicators of inflation expectations h ave risen, and projections for inflation this year have been revised up notably."
 And it will help ensure that longer -term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent.
" Over coming months, we will be looking for compelling evidence that inflation is moving down, consistent with inflation returning to 2 percent."
 Our overarching focus is using our tools to bring inflation back down to our 2 percent goal  and to kee p longer -term inflation expectations well anchored.
 Making appropriate monetary policy in this uncertain environment requires a recognition that the economy often evolves in unexpected ways.
" Inflation has obviously surprised to the upside over the past ye ar, and further surprises could be in store."
 We are highly attentive to inflation risks  and determined to take the measures necessary to restore price stability.
 The American economy is very strong and well positioned to handle tighter monetary policy.
 We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum -employment and price -stability goals.
" So, as you know, we always aim to provide as much clarity as we can about our  policy intentions subject to the inherent uncertainty in the economic outlook, because we think monetary policy is more effective when market participants understand how policy will evolve, when they understand our objective function, our reaction function."
" And in the current highly unusual circumstances with inflation well above our goal, we think it ’s helpful to provide even more clarity than usual —again , subject to uncertainty in the outlook."
" So we got the CPI data and also some data on inflation expectations late last week, and we thought for a while , and we thought , well , this is the appropriate thing to do."
" So if you take a step back, what we ’re looking for is compelling evidence that inflationary pressur es are abating and that inflation is moving back down."
 A nd we ’d like to see that in the form of a series of declining monthly inflation readings —that’s what we ’re looking for.
" And , by this point, we had actually been expecting to see clear signs of at least inflation flattening out and , ideally , beginning to decline."
" We’ve said that we ’d be data dependent, focused on incoming data, highly attentive to inflation risks —the things tha t I mentioned to Howard moments ago."
" So contrary to expectations, inflation again surprised to the upside ."
" Indicators —some indicators of inflation expectations have risen , and projections of [inflation] this year have June 15, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  Page 7 of 27   moved up notably."
" And that ’s generally what June 15, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  Page 8 of 27   people see as the appropriate path for getting inflation under control and starting back down and getting back down to 2 percent."
" You have not used the phrase in a long time “ monetary policy is in a good place,”  which is a phrase that you used to use often."
" Now that the Committee is projecting 4 percent on a—or 3.8 percent next year in terms of the funds rate, which is similar to where the market is now, the futures market of 4 percent funds rate next year, do you think that ’s a level that is going to be sufficie ntly high enough to deal with and bring down the inflation problem?"
" And that desired affect is , we’d like to see demand moderating."
 Demand is very hot still in the economy.
" W e’d like to see the labor market getting better in balance between supply and demand , and that can happen [as a result of developments coming] both from supply and demand."
" Right now , there ’s—demand is substantially higher than available supply , though, so we feel that there ’s a role for us in moderating demand."
" There are many things we can’ t affect, and those would be , you know, the things —the commodity price issues that we ’re having around the world due to the war in Ukraine and the fallout from that, and also just all of the suppl yside things that are still pushing upward on inflation."
 Does it get the job done on breaking the back of inflation?
" I mean , honestly,  though, that would be —you would have positive real rates , I think , and inflation coming down by then."
 And I know you just said that wha t changed was really the inflation data—the inflation expectations data .
" But I’m wondering, on the inflation expectations data, was there something you saw that was unsettling enough to risk eroding the credibility of your verbal guidance by doing somethi ng so different from what you had “socialized ” before?"
" So if you look at a broad range of inflation expectations —so you’ ve got the public, you’ ve got surveys of the public and of experts , and you’ ve also got market based."
" And I think if you look across that broad range of data, what you see is that expectations are still in the place, very much in the place, where short -term inflation is going to be high but comes down sharply over the next couple  of years."
 And that ’s really where inflation expectations are.
" We also noticed that the index of c ommon i nflation e xpectations at the Board has moved up after being pretty flat for a long time, so we ’re watching t hat, and we ’re thinking, “t his is something we need to take seriously.”   And that is one of the factors , as I mentioned—o ne of the factors in our deciding to move ahead with 75 basis points today was what we saw in inflation expectations."
" So if you saw a movement like that again, another tickup in inflation expectations, would that put a 75 or even 100 basis point increase in play at your next meeting?"
" Fortyyear highs in inflation —we think th at policy is going to need t o be restrictive, and we don’ t know how restrictive."
 And should we think of that as a kind of symmetrical reaction function if we start to get soft readings on inflation or if the labor market starts to roll o ver?
" So,  again, the overall exercise is that we try to be —provide as much clarity about our policy intentions as we can, because we think that makes monetary policy work better."
" With us having really just done very little in the way of raising interest rates, financial conditions have tightened quite significantly through the expectations channel, as we ’ve made it clear what our plans are."
" And , in this particular situation, you know, we ’re looking for something specific, and that is progress on inflation."
" W e want to see —inflation can’t go down until it flattens out , and that ’s what we ’re looking to see."
" On the “ clear and convincing”  threshold for the inflation trajectory, what is the level of realized inflation that meets that criteria ?"
 And how is the Committee thinking about the potential tradeoff of much higher unemployment than even in what ’s forecasted in the SEP if inflation is not moderating at this acceptable pace?
 W hat’s the potential tradeoff with higher unemployment than even what ’s forecasted in the SEP if inflation is not moderating a t an acceptable pace?
" So, what we want to see is a series of declining monthly readings for inflation, and we ’d like to see inflation headed down."
"  So that ’s the kind of thinking we ’ll be doing, and , again, we ’re looking—ultimately , we’re not going to declare victory until we see a series of these, really see convincing evidence, compelling ev idence , that inflation is coming down."
" A nd that ’s what I mean by—that ’s what it would take for us to say, “O kay, we think this job is done.”   Because we saw—and, frankly, we saw last year —inflation came down over the course of the summer and then turned  right around and went back up."
" Are you more concerned now that to bring down inflation, it’ s going to require more than just some pain at this point?"
" Again, I think that —I do think that our objective , and this is what ’s reflected in the SEP, but our objective , really , is to bring inflation down to 2 percent while the labor market remains strong."
" But having said that, there is a path for us to get there —it’s not getting easier ; it’s getting more challenging because of these external forces—and that path is to move demand down, and you have a lot of surplus demand."
" And you could say the same thing about some of the product markets where there ’s just excess capacity and really where the strong demand has gone into—sorry , where they ’re capacity constrained, right?"
" So demand comes in , and it’s very strong , and it shows up in higher prices —not  higher quantities, not more cars, because they can ’t make the cars because they don ’t have the semiconductors."
" When demand comes down, you could see —and it ’s not guaranteed —but you could see prices coming down more than the typical economic relationships that you see in the textbooks would suggest , because of the unusual situation we ’re in on the supply side."
 So the new projections show the unemployment rate ticking up through 2024.
 I s a higher unemployment rate necessary in order to co mbat inflation?
" And June 15, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  Page 15 of 27   what is lost if the unemployment rate has to go up and people lose their jobs in order to control inflation?"
" In the SEP, we have unemployment going up to 4 point —the me dian is 4.1  percent —of course , [there is] a range  of actual forecasts."
" And I would characterize that, if you were to get inflation down to, you know , on its way down to 2 percent and the unemployment rate went up to 4.1 percent, that ’s still a historically low level."
"  We hadn ’t seen —we hadn’t seen  rates, unemployment rates below 4  percent until a couple years ago for —we ’d seen it for , like , one year in the last 50."
 So a 4.1 percent unemployment ra te with inflation well on its way to 2 percent —I think that would be —I think that would be a successful outcome.
 So we ’re not looking to have a higher unemployment rate .
" But, to get there —it’s not going to happen with the levels of inflation June 15, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  Page 16 of 27   we have."
" So , as you just mentioned, the Committee is now projecting a ½ percentage point rise in the unemployment rate and the SEPs over the next couple of years , and it removed a line from its policy statement about thinking that the labor market can remain strong while it tightens pol icy."
" You just mentioned that that is still your objective , though, so I ’m wondering if you could explain why that line was removed from the statement—also whether this means the F OMC is trying to induce a recession now to bring inflation down."
 We’re trying to achieve 2 percent inflation consistent with a strong labor market.
" Clearly , it’s our goal to bring about 2 percent inflation while keeping the labor market strong, right?"
" The SEP has inflation getting down to 2, a little above 2 percent in 2024, with unemployment at 4.1 percent."
" So the sentence that we deleted said that we believe that appropriate monetary policy , effectively alone, can bring about the result of 2 percent inflation with a strong labor market."
 And so much of it is really not down to monetary policy.
" I t just didn ’t—the June 15, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  Page 17 of 27   sentence isn ’t—it kind of says on its face that monetary policy alone can do this."
" And given the new projections for the unemployment rate, could you talk a little bit about what accounts for such reduced confidence against , say, a month ago or three months ago that inflation will largely normalize on its own as these supplyside issues get worked out?"
" And you look around the world—I mean , lots of countries are —lots of countries are looking at inflation of 10 percent, and it ’s largely due to commodities prices."
" So that is really —and, by the way, headline inflation, headline inflation is important for expectations."
" People —the public ’s expectations, why would they be distinguishing between core inflation and headline inflation?"
  Core inflation is something we [on the Committee] think a bout because it is a better predictor of future inflation.
 But headline inflation is what people experience .
" We see job growth slowing, but it ’s still at quite robust levels."
 We see the economy slowing a bit but still growth levels —healthy growth levels.
" And , again, there ’s a lot going on —there are a lot of flows back and June 15, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  Page 19 of 27   forth —but , ultimately , it does appear that the U.S. economy is in a strong position and well  positioned to deal with higher interest rates."
 Are you targeting headline inflation now or core inflation?
 So the —we ’re responsible for inflation in the law.
 And inflation means headline i nflation.
" We, of course, like all central b anks do, look very, very carefully at core inflation because it is —it’s a much better predictor , and it ’s much—it ’s a much better predictor of where inflation is going , and it ’s also  more relevant to our tools."
 But we have to be mindful of the potential effect on inflation expectations [coming] from headline  [inflation readings] .
" So it’ s a very difficult situation to be in , and we —again, we can ’t do much about the difference between [h eadline and core inflation rates due to] the elements that make up headline that are not in core."
" You’ve talked about how you want to see inflation coming down over a series of reports , and I guess I ’m curious whether you think inflation data itself is a really good indicator or whether you might be concerned that it ’s a lagging indicator or that it might send confusing signals given that , as you’ ve talked about, there are sort of supply and demand aspects ."
" And I guess my question is, do you think that inflation will tell you —inflation data will tell you when you’ ve gone to where you need to go, or do you just feel like maybe it ’s better to overshoot than to undershoot?"
" So I think the role that we can play—maybe the way to get at this is to say that the role that we can play is around demand, right?"
" A nd we ’ll be able to see—th e areas that we can affect are those associated with excess demand , and we ’ll be able to see our effect on , for example, job openings in real  time."
" Wages are not principally responsible for the inflation that we ’re seeing , but, going forward, they would be very important, particularly in the service sector ."
" My question is, is inflation data itself the best ind icator for when you’re getting to where you need to go, or might it lead you to go too far?"
 This inflation happened relatively recently .
" We think that the public generally sees us as very likely to be successful in getting inflation down to 2 percent , and that ’s critical."
" You talk about consumer sentiment being down, also inflation expectations being up, recession just broadly being dinner table talk."
" Does the general feel among American households and also businesses square with your e xplanation of the economy, given that the description of inflation in the statement didn ’t change between May and June?"
" So, clearly , people don’ t like inflation —a lot."
" And many people are experiencing it , really , for the first time , because we haven ’t had anything like this kind of inflation in 40 years ."
" And we understa nd that , and we understand the hardship that people are experiencing from high inflation, and we ’re determined to do what we can to get inflation back down."
" I guess what I ’m saying is, the question, the really critical question from the perspective of doing our job is making sure that the public does have confidence that we have the tools and will use them and they do work to bring inflation back down over time."
" It will take some time , we think, to get inflation back down, but we will do that."
" You have talked about inflation a few times and mentioned oil prices, China lockdowns ."
" But aside from rises in commodity prices such as gas prices, we’ re also seeing stickier measures of inflation increasing , such as the Cleveland Fed ’s median and trimmed  mean CPIs.  I mean , how persistent do you see those underlying measures of inflation, and how do you expect to—where do you see those going in the near future ?"
"  So, as I mentioned , I think , in my opening statement, inflation has started —it started off in quite narrow, very directly pandemic -related areas , and it ’s spread now broadly across the economy and into the services sector as well ."
" S ome of that will be passthrough of  energy prices , but it ’s—so you’ re experiencing services inflation."
 Shelter inflation is high.
" Do you still think a softish landing is possible , and how would you define that at this point considering the revised projections f or unemployment, GDP, inflation?"
" If you see—you’ re looking at getting back down to almost a 2 percent inflation by 2024, and the unemployment rate is still as low as 4.1 percent ."
" So we just don’ t know, but we ’re focused on —very, very focused on getting inflation back down to 2 percent, which we think is essential for the b enefit of the public and also to put us on a path back to a sustainably strong labor market like the one we had before the pandemic."
" I was wondering if the F ed has initiated a review of the conduct of monetary policy over the last two years or so, given the inflation, and will that be shared with the public?"
"  So, of course , we’ve been looking very carefully and hard at why inflation picked up so much more than expected last year and why it proved so persistent."
" For—really , the context is this :  For decades before the pandemic and the reopening, you had a world where inflation was dominated by disinflationary forces such as declining population or aging demographics, let ’s call it that, globalization enabled by technology, other factors, low productivity."
" So we have now experienced an extraordinary series of shocks , if you think about it :  the pandemic, the response, the reopening, inflation, followed by the war in Ukraine, followed by shutdowns in China —the war in Ukraine potentially having effects for years here."
" Inflation is behaving dif ferently , and,  in our thinking, it really is a question of very strong demand."
" B ut you couldn ’t get this kind of inflation without a change on the supply side, which is there for anybody to see, which is these blockages and shortages and people dropping out of the labor force and things like that."
" In the meantime , we have to find price stability in this new world and maximum employment in this new world where , clearly , inflationary forces are —you ’re seeing them everywhere."
" Again, if you look around the world at where inflation levels are, it ’s absolutely extraordi nary."
" In fact, we ’re sort of in the middle of the pack, although I think we have , of course , a different kind of inflation than other people have , partly because our economy is stronger and more highly recover ed."
" So rates were very low —a good place to start is that rates were very, very low for quite a while because of the pandemic and the need to do everything we could June 15, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  Page 27 of 27   to support the economy when unemployment was 14 percent and the true unempl oyment rate was well higher than that."
" So, in the meantime, while rates were low and while  demand was really high, obviously demand for housing changed from wa nting to live in urban areas to some extent to living in single -family homes in the suburbs, famously."
 A nd so the demand was just suddenly much higher.
 We need to get back to a place where supply and demand are back together and where inflation is down low again and mortgage rates are low again.
