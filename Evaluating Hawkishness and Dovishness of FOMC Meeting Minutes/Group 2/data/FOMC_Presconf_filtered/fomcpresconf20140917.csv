" The Federa l Open Market Committee concluded its meeting earlier today and, as usual, released it s monetary policy statement."
 The Committee also maintained its forward guidance regarding the federal funds rate target and rea ffirmed its view that a highly ac commodative stance of monetary policy remains appropriate.
The economy is continuing to make progress toward the FOMC’s objective of maximum sustainable employment.
" Although the pace of job growth has sl owed some recently, job gains have averaged more than 200,000 per month over the past th ree months."
" The unemployment rate was 6.1 percent in August, twotenths lower than the data available at  the time of the June FOMC meeting."
 These developments continue the trend of gradual progr ess toward our employment objective.
" Indeed, private domestic final demand—that is, spending by domestic households and businesse s—grew about twice as fast as  GDP."
" Indicators of spending and production for the third quarter suggest that  economic activity is expanding at a moderate pace, and the Committee continues to expect a moderate pace of growth going forward."
" Inflation has been running below the Committ ee’s 2 percent objective, but with longerterm inflation expectations appearing to be we ll anchored and the economic recovery continuing, the Committee expects inflation to move gradua lly back toward its ob jective."
" Moreover, inflation has firmed some since earlier in the year, and the Co mmittee believes that the likelihood of inflation running persistently below 2 percent has diminished."
" As is always the case, the Committee will continue to assess incoming data careful ly to ensure that policy is consistent with attaining the FOMC’s longerrun goals of maxi mum employment and inflation of 2 percent."
" As always, each participant’s projections are cond itioned on his or her own view of appropriate monetary policy."
 Committee participants generally see the unemployment rate declining to its longerrun normal level over the course of 2016 a nd edging a bit below that level in 2017.
" The central tendency of September 17, 2014   Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL  Page 3 of 22 the projections for real GDP growth is 2.0 to 2.2 percent for 2014, down slightly from the June projections."
" Over the next three years, the proj ections for real GDP growth run somewhat above the estimates of longerrun normal growth."
" Finally, FOMC participants con tinue to see inflation moving gradually back toward 2 percent."
" The ce ntral tendency of the inflation projections is 1.5 to 1.7 percent in 2014, rising to 1.9 to 2 percent in 2017."
" Two years ago, when the FOMC began this purchase program, the unemployment rate stood at 8.1 percent, and prog ress in lowering it was expected to be much slower than desired without a dditional policy accommodation."
 The intent of the program was to achieve a substantial improvement in  the outlook for the labor market and to ensure that inflation was moving back toward the Committee’s longerrun goal of 2 percent.
" In light of the cumulative progress toward maximum employment and the improvement in the outlook for labor market conditions since the inception of the progr am, and with the likelihood of inflation running persistently below 2 percent having diminished somewhat, we have reduced our pace of asset purchases again at this meeti ng."
" If incoming information broadly supports the Committee’ s expectation of ongoing improveme nt in the labor market and inflation moving back over time toward its 2 percent longerrun objective, the Committee will end this program at our next meeting."
" The Committee’s sizable holdings of longerterm securities should help maintain accommodative financial September 17, 2014   Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL  Page 4 of 22 conditions and promote further progress toward  our objectives of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent."
"  Regarding interest rates, the Committee rea ffirmed its forward guidance “that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current ta rget range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time after the asset purchase prog ram ends, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee’s 2 per cent longerrun goal, and longerterm inflation expectations remain well anchored.”   This judgment is based on the Committee’s assessment of realized and expected progress toward its obj ectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation—an assessment that is based on a wide  range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators  of inflation pressures and infl ation expectations, and readings on financial developments."
" Further, once we begin to remove policy accommodation, it is the Committee’s current assessment that, even after employment and inflation are near mandateconsistent levels, economic conditions may, for so me time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run."
" Notably, al though the central tenden cy of the unemployment rate in late 2016 is slightly below its estimat ed longerrun value, and the central tendency for inflation is close to our 2 percen t objective, the median projection fo r the federal funds rate at the end of 2016, at 2.9 percent, remains nearly a pe rcentage point below the longerrun value of 3¾ percent or so projected by mo st participants."
" Although FOMC participants provide a number September 17, 2014   Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL  Page 5 of 22 of explanations for the federal funds rate running  below its longerrun normal level at that time, many cite the residual effects of the financia l crisis, which, although slowly diminishing, are likely to continue to restrain household spe nding, constrain credit availability, and depress expectations for future growth in output and inco mes."
" If the economy proves to be stronger than anticipated by the Committee, resulting in a more rapid convergence of employment and inflation to the FOMC’s objectives, then increases  in the federal funds rate are likely to occur sooner and to be more rapid than currently envisaged."
Let me now turn to our statement on “Policy Normalization Principles and Plans.”  This statement is intended to provide information to  the public about the eventual normalization process; it does not signal a change in the curr ent or future stance of monetary policy.
" As is always the case in setting policy, the FOMC  will determine the timing and pace of policy normalization so as to promote its statutory mandate of maximum employment and price stability."
"Since the crisis, the Federal Reserve has been providing extraordinary accommodation using nontraditional tools of monetary policy."
"  As was the case before the crisis, the Committ ee intends to adjust the stance of monetary policy during normalization primarily through acti ons that influence the level of the federal funds rate and other shortterm interest rates,  not through active management of the balance sheet."
"  It’s the Committee’s intention th at the Federal Reserve will, in the longer run, hold no more securities than necessary to implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively, and that these securities will primarily cons ist of Treasury securities."
"As I stated earlier, today’ s release of the Committee’s upda ted normalization plans is in no way intended to signal a change in the stance of  monetary policy."
 This is part of our assessment of economic conditions and the appropri ate stance of monetary policy.
" So th e outlook is little changed—a slight decline in the anticipated path of the unemploymen t rate and a very slight  uptick in the inflation projection, but really quite minimal."
" It has said that it will be looking at  the actual and projected pace at which the gaps between our employment and infl ation, and our goals for those variables, are closing."
 And then what the Committee does at ea ch meeting is—after saying that the assessment will take into account many different indicators and take into account inflation pressures and other things—it goes on to provide at that meeting its assessment of the im plications of its view of the data at that time.
" The Committee, based on its assessmen t at each meeting, has felt comfortable saying that, based on its assessment of those factors, it considers that it will be likely appropriate to maintain the current target range for a consider able time after the asset purchase program ends, especially if inflation remains below the 2 percen t objective."
" Well, the grow th projections for 2014 are down a little bit, but the unemployment path is also marginally lower."
" So  while the projected path of the labor market—unemployment and other measures of the labor market—of course is partly dependent on the growth outlook, it isn’t totally dependent on th e growth outlook."
" And the Committee assesses that the labor market is conti nuing to improve, and you see a sma ll reduction in the path of the unemployment this year and then over the rest of the projection period."
" But, as a guess, I would hazard—first, I woul d say, there is relatively little  upward movement in the path, and I would view it as broadly in line with what  one would expect with a very small downward reduction in the path for unemployment and a very  slight upward change in the projection for inflation."
" So, most participants, in deciding on the path, I think, look at, as our guidance says, how large is the gap between pe rformance of the labor market and that associated with our maximum employment objective, how large is the gap between inflation and our 2 percent objective, how fast will those gaps change."
" W hy, in your view, is economic growth not creating more inflation in wages and in PCE?"
" Growth has been positive, and it’s lasted for five years."
" And while unemployment has come way down from the slightly over 10 percent level it reached, at 6.1 percent, it remains significantly above the level that most September 17, 2014   Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL  Page 12 of 22 FOMC participants would regard as consistent with normal in the longer run, 5.2 to 5.5 percent."
 We continue to discuss whether or not the unemployment rate itself is  an adequate measure of how much underutilization of labor resources there really is.
" And, as I went into de tail in Jackson Hole and w on’t repeat all of that there, there are other ways in which we see underutilization—high levels  that have come down only very marginally of parttime employ ment for economic—or involuntary parttime employment, perhaps some remaining shortfall of la bor force participation as a result of cyclical factors."
" Chair Yellen, I want to come back to the interest rate projections  that the Fed put out today."
" They are taking into account the po ssibility that there can be different economic outcomes, including—even if they’re not ve ry likely—ones in which outcomes will be characterized by low inflation or low growth a nd the appropriate path of rates will be low."
" So, I think the Committee would—will be focused on—we intend to use the path of shortterm interest rates as our key tool of policy."
" And, of course, market participan ts will be very focused, as we are, on what is the appropriate timing and pace of interest rate increases when  that time comes."
" Is that now the “house” view that slack essentially consists of unemployment plus parttime workers who want fulltime work, and that labor force participation is basically out of the equation?"
" We have been at zero for a very long time and below the leve ls that some common policy rules would now be suggesting, given the level of unemployment and infl ation."
" And once we decide it’s appropriate to be gin to normalize policy and to rais e the level of our target for September 17, 2014   Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL  Page 17 of 22 shortterm interest rates, it would still take some  time for rates to get back to levels—you can see in our projection that by the end of 2017, the partic ipants are, on average,  projecting that rates will reach the levels they consider normal in the longer run."
" I think they, perhaps, have some concerns that if we don’t begin to do so soon that inflation will pick up above levels we—that they would consider desirable, or that they have some financial stability concerns."
 There’s been another downgrade in your nearterm growth forecast and a downgrade in your unemployment rate path forecast.
" Secondarily, how concerned are you about even ts in Europe and especially the recent decline in inflation expectations there?"
" So there’s been  a little bit of dow ngrading, I think, ev en this time in the longerrun normal growth rates that Committ ee participants have written down."
" You are certainly right in saying that over a number of y ears now, there’s been a pa ttern of forecast errors in which either we’ve been on track with resp ect to unemployment or unemployment has come down in some cases faster than we anticipated, and yet growth has pretty persistently been surprising the Committee to the downside."
" And th at is a statement about  productivity growth, which has been pretty disappointing."
" So we have had downward revisions in the level of potential output and to some exte nt, at least for a time, in the pr ojected pace of growth."
" Well, I mean, you know, certainly we have discussed the outlook for Europe—the very low leve l of inflation that they have seen recently and the decline that they saw in inflationary expectat ions, in the slow pace of growth."
" It is one of a number of risks to the global economy, and we cer tainly hope that they will be successful in seeing the pace of growth and inflation pick up, and I think that will be good for the global economy and the United States."
" They want to ma ke sure that if progre ss really does turn out to be faster than we have—we would expect, th at the Committee will be in a position to start sooner tightening monetary policy."
" Getting b ack to the one aspect of the forward guidance is the statement, which you’ ve reiterated about the funds rate probably needing to stay below normal for some time  after achieving mandateconsistent levels on unemployment, inflation, and so forth."
" If you look at the SEP projections of unemployment, inflation, a nd so forth, they seem to get back to those mandateconsistent levels by the end of 2016, if not mu ch sooner."
" So on the first question of “some time” before rates return to normal levels, as I mentioned, you can see in the SEP that by the end of 2017, many participants are anticipating that rates will return to what they think ar e normal longerru n levels, but the economy, in their view, will have probably gotten back to normal levels of unemployment and nearnormal levels of inflation sometime in 2016."
" But a common view on this is that there have been a variety of headwinds resulti ng from the crisis that have slowed growth, led to a sluggish recovery from the crisis, and that  these headwinds will dissipate only slowly, that they are dissipating—an example wo uld be the fact that mortgage credit really is, at this point, available really to those with pristine credit ."
" In addition, we have had slow  productivity growth, and a slow pace of potential output likely depresses the pace of investment sp ending."
