" At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed to achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us:  maximum employment and price stability."
 Today the Federal Open Market Committee kept interest rates near zero  and maintained our asset pur chases.
" These measures, along with our strong guidance on interest rates and on our balance sheet, will ensure that monetary policy will continue to support the economy until the recovery is complete."
" Indicators of economic activity and employment have continued to strengthen , and real GDP this year appears to be on track to post its fastest rate of increase in decades."
 Much of this rapid growth reflects the continued bounceback in activity from depressed levels.
" As with overall economic activity, conditions in the labor market have continued to improve."
" Demand for labor is very strong, and employment rose 850,000 in June, with the July 28, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 2 of 29   leisure and hospitality sector continuing to post notable gains."
"The unemployment rate in June —in June  was 5.9 percent, and this figure understates the shortfall in employment, particularly as participation in the labor market has not moved up from the low rates that have prevailed for most of the past year."
" Factors related to the pandemic, such as caregiving needs, ongoing fears of the virus, and unemployment insurance payments, appear to be weighing on employment growth."
" These factors should wane in coming months, leading to strong gains in employment."
 Inflation has increased notably and will lik ely remain elevated in coming months before moderating.
" These bottleneck effects have been larger than anticipated, but as these transitory supply effects abate, inflation is expected to drop back toward our longer -run goal."
" As the reopening continues, bottlenecks, hiring difficulties, and other constraints could continue to limit how quickly supply can adjust, raising the possibility that July 28, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 3 of 29   inflation  could turn out to be higher and more persistent than we expect."
" O ur new framework for monetary policy emphasizes the importance of having well -anchored inflation expectations, both to, to foster price stability and to enhance our ability to promote our broad -based and inclusive maximum -employment goal."
 Indicators of lon gterm inflation expectations appear broadly consistent with our longerrun inflation goal of 2 percent.
" If we saw signs that the path of inflation or longer -term inflation expectations were moving materially and persistently beyond levels consistent with our goal, we’d be prepared to adjust the stance of policy."
"The Fed’s policy actions have been guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to promote the stability of the financial system."
" As the Committee reiterated in today’s policy statement, with inflation having run persistently below 2  percent, we will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2  percent over time and longer -term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2  percent."
 We expect to maintain an accommodative stance of m onetary policy until these employment and inflation outcomes are achieved.
" With regard to interest rates, we continue to expect that it will be appropriate to maintain the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate until labor market co nditions July 28, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 4 of 29   have reached level —levels consistent with the Committee’s assessment of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2  percent for some  time."
" In addition, we are continuing to—continuing to increase our holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80  billion per month and of agency MBS by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward our maximumemployment and price -stability goals."
 So let’s talk about the maximum -employment part of that.
" As you know, with maximum employment —unlike with, with  price stability , where we can target a number of 2 percent  on average—with maximum employment, there isn ’t a single number that we can target."
" There ’s unemployment, unemployment among different , different age groups , and such."
 And we look at all of it to try to arrive at a picture of what—of what  is maximum employment.
" I think we ’re, we’re some way away from , from  having had substantial further progress with , with  max —toward the maximum -employment goal."
 You didn’ t—does it mean you feel like you’ ve reached your goal when it comes to the inflation side?
" So inflation is running well above our 2 percent  objective and ha s been for a few months and is expected to run up certainly above our objective for a few months before we believe it ’ll, it’ll  move back down toward our objective."
" But it ’s clear that, at this time, inflation is actually running above 2  percent."
"  In your opening statements in March and April, you noted that a transitory rise in inflation above 2 percent  this year would not meet the threshold of moderately exceeding 2 percent  for some time, and I noticed you didn’ t repeat that qualification last month or today."
" And , and so, in your view, has the rise in inflation this year met the threshold of moderately exceeding 2  percent  for some  time?"
" That ’s—what the guidance is for liftoff, we had to have labor market conditions consistent with full employment, infla tion at 2  percent  and on track to run —to run moderately above 2 percent  for some time."
 We’re clearly a ways away from considering raising interest rates.
 So I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about how the divergence in global growth and the sort of multispeed recovery we ’re seeing around the world impacts how the F ed thinks about its policies.
" And so they’ re seeing significant outbreaks, and it ’s weighing on economic activity, whereas other countries—such as the United States, in particular —are having a very strong rebound."
" And , and, you know, that ’ll help economic activity."
"  To the extent the  global economy is weak and the United States is strong, it ’ll—we ’ll wind up , you know, we ’ll wind up exporting some of our demand through, through imports rather than having , having a lot of exports."
" Now, as , as vaccinations rise, we can nonetheless get back to our economic activity."
" Chair Powell, how would you describe the risks to the outlook on inflation at the moment after the last data came out higher than expected?"
" Are you s till worried that there could be a hit to demand from, from the Delta variant that could tilt them sort of to the downside again?"
" So if you look, agai n, if you look at the , the most recent inflation report, what you see is that it came in significantly higher than expected."
 It isn ’t the kind of inflation that’ s spread broadly across the economy.
 And so we think that inflation should move down over time.
" I would say, in the near term, that July 28, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 11 of 29   the, the, the risks to inflation are probably to the upside."
" I , I, I have some confidence in  the—in the medium term, that inflation will move back down."
"I, I, I will say, though, that, you know, we —inflation is half of our mandate."
" And if we were to see inflation moving up to levels persistently that were—that were above, significantly, materially above our goal and particularly if inflation expectations were  to move up, we would use our tools to guide inflation back down to 2 percent ."
"So we won ’t have an extended period of , of high inflation."
"  In any case, we will use our tools over time as appropriate to make sure that we do have inflation that averages 2  percent  over time."
 And how do you balance that with managing inflation concerns?
" Some of it is a fall in real yields, which may have been connected to—some speculate —connected to sentiment around the , the spread of the Delta variant and concern about growth."
" There was also some decli ne in inflation compensation, which ha s significantly reversed."
 We are committed to achieving 2 percent  average inflation over time.
" What we said was that, in particular, when we see a very strong labor market, high levels of employment, low levels of unemployment, that won’ t be enough for us to raise interest rates until we see some inflation."
" So we ’re, you know, we ’re, we’re  a ways away from full maximum employment."
" But we have high inflation, so it ’s kind of the opposite case."
" Any central bank has to deal with that by looking at the inflation and asking whether it is broad based and likely to be persistent and , and, and whether inflation expectations are implicated in a way that , that  could cause them to rise."
" And , and I think the real test of it will be down the road when it ’s time to think about raising interest rates and , and how we assess, assess that set of issues."
" Chairman Powell, you, you  just alluded to the fact that you ’re prepared to use your tools to slow the economy down if need be to—if inflation looks like  it’s getting out of control."
" Does that mean you’ d be prepared to raise interest rates even if we’ re not at maximum employment at that point, should you see this danger of inflation?"
" And , and, two, does it also mean you’ d be prepared to raise interest rates even if you are still buying assets?"
" M ost of the time, if you have high inflation, you also have  high employment —they, they tend to go together."
" We’re not at full employment, but we are having high inflation."
"We feel like we’ re going to be making good progress over the next —over  the course of the next year, couple of years, really, toward maximum employment."
" If you look at the number of job openings compared to the number of unemployed, it’s—we ’re, we’re  clearly on a path to a very strong labor market with high participation, low unemployment, high employment, wages moving up across the spectrum ."
" And, again, it ’s not —it’s not  timely for us to be thinking about , about  raising interest rates right now."
 You just said we ’re on a path to a very strong job market.
 Is it the extended unemployment benefits?
" And there ’s also been very generous July 28, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 15 of 29   unemployment benefits, which are now rolling off."
" And if people don’ t go back into the labor force, then the job growth won’ t be as strong, those kinds of things."
" It means that the increases in prices will happen, so there will be inflation but that the process of inflation will stop so that —so that there won’ t be further—when , when we think of inflation, we really think of inflation going up year upon year upon year upon year."
 That ’s inflation.
" When you have inflation for 12 mo nths or whatever it might be —I’m just taking an example ; I’m not making an estimate —then, then  you have a price increase, but you don’ t have an inflation process."
" And so part of that just is that, if it doesn ’t affect longerterm inflation expectations, t hen it ’s very likely not to infect —to affect the process of inflation going forward."
" So what , what  I mean by “transitory ” is just something that doesn ’t leave a permanent mark on the inflation process."
" So to the extent people are , are, are implementing price increases because raw materials are going up or labor costs or something ’s going up, you know, the question,  really , for inflation really is, does that mean they ’re going to go up the next year by the same amount?"
" So you’ re going to be in a process where inflation, the inflation process , gets going."
" And, and that happens because people ’s expectations about future inflation move up."
" But, nonetheless, we have to watch this very carefully because this is —you know, we have two mandates:   maximum employment and price stability."
" Price stability , for us , means inflation averaging 2 percent  over time."
" And the statement says that the Fed  is going to use —to, to evaluate the developments in the two markets, in jobs and inflation, in coming meetings."
" In other words, you’ve stimulated demand."
" And then they were a big part of , of creating accommodative financial conditions to support demand."
" Hi.  You ’ve been asked a lot previously i f the Fed ’s monetary policy at all contributes to inequality, but I was really curious to know where you think the Fed ’s regulatory policy lands , particularly if you think that the Fed ’s bank capital requirements have had the effect of penalizing lower -income households seeking loans."
" Chair Powell, I guess I wanted to ask about the last —when you were before Congress earlier this month, you mentioned, I think, something along the lines of , it won ’t take too long before we see if you’ re right about inflation and its temporary aspect."
 When do you think you’ ll get a clean reading on inflation that is free of most of the distortions that we ’re seeing now ?
" So with inflation, as I mentioned, we’re , we look not just at the headline number , but we look at all the components that go into the calculation of inflation."
" What we’ re seeing is a handful of things that are really —that really account for the , the overshoot of inflation."
" So that ’s, that’s  a big, big part of , of why the inflation readings are so high."
" And those don’t—those , frankly , don ’t carry significant implications in the long run for the —for inflation or for the American economy."
" If they flatten out, then their , their contribution to inflation becomes zero over time so that they ’re not contributing to inflation."
" So it ’s, it’s set at 25  basis points , so out of the money, and it ’s, it’s there to help address pressures in money market —money markets that could impede the effectiv e implementation of monetary policy."
" So, really, it ’s, it’s to support the function of —functioning of monetary policy and its , its effectiveness."
" Chair Powell, I was going to go back to inflation a little bit."
" It , it seems like you ’re just sort of warning that, if inflation gets too high, you know, the Fed  will act."
" No.  Look, we—as you know, we ’re targeting a moderate overshoot of 2  percent  inflation for some time."
" We, we want inflation expectations to be centered on, on 2 percent ."
" Th at was the kind of inflation we were thinking about that comes from, you know , from a very, very strong labor market and a —and a  booming July 28, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 27 of 29   economy maybe."
" T hat, that was the kind of inflation —this, this  is something different."
" This is really driven by the s upply side, which is not able to hand—to handle this big spike in demand that we ’re seeing."
" As the economy reopens with vaccination and fiscal support and monetary policy support, the supply side —just all over the world , you’ re seeing the same thing, whic h is, it just can ’t keep up."
" Now, we —but, you know , are—we ’re actually responsible for this, though, so we have to take seriously the risk, the risk case, which is that inflation will be more persistent, that it might actually move inflation expectations up, and that  we might —that the kind of things that might require a response."
" My base case is that —is, as I ’ve said repeatedly, is that inflation will move back down."
" And no, w e’re not —we , we have not at all changed our view, and I haven’ t changed my view that inflation running above 2 percent , moderately above 2 percent , is a desirable thing."
 But it ’s also not the kind of inflation we were looking for.
 And it doesn ’t sound like you’ re concerned about rising wages feeding into broader inflation .
" And we , we don’t see— there , there  is a form of wage inflation that can lead to price inflation, and we ’re not seeing that r ight now."
" This is something that was a featur e of the high inflationary era of the G reat Inflation, but it ’s not a feature now."
" You know, but wages moving up across the spectrum, consistent with inflation and productivity, is a—is a good thing."
