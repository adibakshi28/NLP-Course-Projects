" At the Federal Reserve,  we are strongly committed to achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us :  maximum employment and price stability."
 Today my c olleagues on the FOMC and I kept interest rates near zero and maintained our sizable asset purchases.
" These measures, along with our strong guidance on interest rates and our balance sheet, will ensure that monetary policy will continue to deliver powerful support to the economy until the recovery is complete."
" A resurgence in recent months  in COVID19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths is causing great hardship for millions of Americans and is weighing on economic activity and job creation."
" Following a sharp rebound in economic activity last summer, the pace of the recovery has moderated in recent  months , with the weakness concentrated in the sectors of  the economy most adversely affected by the resurgence of the virus and by greater social distancing ."
" In contrast, t he housing sector has more than fully recovered from the downturn, supported in part by low mortgage interest rates."
" The overall recovery  in econom ic activity since last spring is due in part to federal stimulus payments and expanded unemployment benefits, which have provided essential support to many families and individuals ."
" Overall economic activity remains below its level before the pandemic , and the path ahead remains highly uncertain."
" As with overall economic activity, the pace of improvement in the labor market has slowed in recent months ."
" Employment  fell by 140 ,000 in December , as continued gains in many industries  were outweighed by significant  losses in industries where the resurgence of the virus has weighed further on activity ."
" T he unemployment rate remain ed elevated at 6.7 percent  in December, and p articipation in the labor market is notably below pre -pandemic levels."
 The pandemic has also left a significant imprint on inflation.
" Overall, on a 12month basis, inflation remains below our 2 percent longer -run objective."
" Finally, monetary policy is playing a key role in supporting the recovery and will con tinue to do so."
" The Fed’s response to this crisis has been guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to promote the stability of the financial system."
" Today we unanimousl y reaffirmed our Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, as we typically do each January."
" As we say  in that statement, we view maximum employment as a “broad -based and inclusive goal.”   Our ability to achieve maximum employment in the years ahead depends importantly on having longer -term inflation expectations well anchored at 2  percent."
" As the Committee  reiterated in to day’s policy statement , with inflation running persistently below 2  percent, we will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2  percent for some time so that inflation averages 2  percent over time and longer -term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2  percent."
  We expect to maintain an accommodative stance of m onetary policy until these  employment and inflation outcomes are achieved.
"  With regard to interest rates, we continue to expect it will be appropriate to maintain the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessment of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2  percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2  percent for some time."
"  In addition, we will continue to increase our holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80  billion per month and of agency mortgage -backed January 27, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  Page 4 of 28   securities by at least $40  billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward our maximum -employment and price -stability goals."
" T he economy is a long way from our employment and inflation goals, and it is likely to take some time for substantial further progress to be achieved."
" Our forward guidance for the federal funds rate , along with our balance sheet guidance , will ensure that the stance of monetary policy remains highly accommodative as the recovery progresses."
 Our guidance is outcome  based and ties  the path of the federal funds rate and the balance sheet  to progress toward reaching our employment and inflation goals.
" Overall, our interest rate and balance sheet tools are providing powerful support to the economy and will continue to do so."
"  But from Bitcoin to corporate bonds to the stock market in general to some of these more specific meteoric rises in stocks like GameStop , how do you address the concern that super easy monetary policy—asset purchases and zero interest rates— are potential ly fueling a bubble that could cause economic fallout should it burst?"
 The shock that the —from the pandemic was unprecedented both in its nature and in its size and in the amount of unemployment that it created and in the shock to economic activity.
 Our role assigned by Congress is maximum employment a nd stable prices and also look after financial stability.
" So, in a world where , almost a year later, we’re, we’re still 9  million jobs, at least —that ’s one way of counting i t; it can actually be counted much higher than that —short of maximum employment an d people are out of the labor force who were in the labor January 27, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  Page 8 of 28   force —the real unemployment rate is close to 10  percent  if you include people that ’ve left the labor force —it’s very much appropriate that monetary policy be highly accommodative to support maximum employment and price stability, which is getting inflation back to 2  percent  and averaging 2 percent  over time."
" So I, I know that monetary policy does play a role there , but that ’s how we look at it."
" And I think, you know, I think that the connection between low interest rates and , and asset January 27, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  Page 9 of 28   values is probably something that ’s not as tight as people think, because a lot of —a lot of  different factors are driving asset prices at any given time."
" Mr. Chairman, do you rule out or see as one of your tools in the toolkit the idea of adjusting monetary policy to address asset values?"
" So, you know, that ’s—as you know, that ’s one of the very difficult questions in all of monetary policy."
" And we don ’t rule it out as a theoretical matter , but we , we clearly look to macroprudential tools, regulatory tools, supervisory tools, other kinds of tools rather than monetary policy in , in addressing financial stability issues."
" It’s not —you know, the , the monetary policy we know strengthens economic activity and job creation through fairly well -understood channels."
" We don’ t actually understand the tradeoff between—the sense of it is, would you—if you raise interest rates and ther eby tighten financial conditions and reduce economic activity now in order to address asset bubbles and things like that , what —will that even help?"
" I wanted to ask you, if there is a near -term rise in inflation related to the recovery, how will you determine whether or not it ’s something that ’s temporary or more enduring?"
  And how much inflation is the F ed willing to tolerate before it acts to restrain price pressures?
" So , on inflation,  a couple of things —there are a couple of things that are worth mentioning."
 One is just that we know that we measure inflation on a trailing 12 -month basis.
" And as we —as we lap the very low inflation readings of March and April of last year, we’ll see measured 12 -month inflation move up a few tenths."
" There ’s also the possibility —indeed, it ’s in some forecasts— that as the economy fully reopens, there ’ll be a burst of spending, and—because people will be enthusiastic that the pandemic is over, potentially, and that that could also create some upward pressure on inflation."
 Expect us to wait and see and not react if we see small and what we would review —we would view as very likely to be transient effects on inflation.
" I think  if you —you know, it helps to look back at , at the inflation dynamics that the United States has had now for some decades a nd notice that there has been, you know, significant disinflationary pressure for some time, for a couple of decades."
 Inflation has averaged less than 2  percent  for a quarter of a century.
" And the inflation dynamics , with the flat Phillips c urve and low persistence of inflation , is very much intact."
" We understand that inflation dynamics evolve constantly over time, but they don’ t January 27, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  Page 11 of 28   change rapidly."
" So we think it ’s very unlikely that anything we see now would result in, you know, troubling inflation."
"Of course, if w e did get sustained inflation at a level that was uncomfortable, we have tools for that."
" It’ s far harder to deal with , with  too low inflation."
" We know what to do with higher inflation, which is, you know, should the need arise, we , we would have those tools."
" In terms of how much, you know, what we ’ve said is we ’d like to see —because inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent , we’d like to see it run moderately above 2  percent  for some time."
" And, again, we ’ll seek inflation moderately above 2  percent  for some time."
" And we ’ll, we’ll show what that means when we get inflation above 2 percent ."
" A nd that includes —you know, that includes us at the F ed, monetary policy."
" I mean, remember, we ’re, we’re  focused on maximum employment, price stability, financial stability as I defined it— the broad financial sector."
" My follow -up question is, a lot of people in the markets think that you’ re basically stuck right now, because you can’ t really go lower with the zero bound, rejecting negative interest rates , and you ca n’t really go higher because of the thr eat of a taper tantrum."
" And , if not, you did say you would signal any change in interest rates a long time ahead."
 We think it ’s providing significant support for economic activity and hiring.
" We, you know, we , we adopted a new monetary policy framework of flexible average inflation targeting in August."
" So we now have, you know, strong guidance on, on rates and on asset purchases that ’s providing very strong support for economic activity."
 We raised interest rates .
 Do you expect more aid directly to consumers to be inflationary?
" And , specifically, how worried should lawmakers be about, you know, causing concerning levels of inflation?"
"  I, I would say that , again, we have been struggling with disinflationary forces for some time."
" If you look around the world—look in Western Europe, look at Japan—around the world, large economies have , have  felt much more downward pressure on inflation, have fallen short of  their inflation goals , for some time now."
" Notwithstanding that , inflation dynamics in the United States have , have  consis ted of a flat Phillips c urve and low persistence for , for a long time."
" I ’m more concern ed about that than about the possibility, which exists , of higher inflation."
" Frankly, we welcome slightly higher inflation, somewhat higher inflation."
" The kind of troubling inflation that people like me grew up with seems , seems  far away and unlikely in, in  the both domestic and global context that we ’ve been in for some time."
" Do you have any kind of assurance or expectation that this will now b e more of a hands -off attitude , in terms of commenting on monetary policy from the A dministration?"
 Right ac ross the board :  much higher forecast s for 2021 growth.
" We ’re just going to look at ba nk—w e’re going to look at the whole range of , of information , including economic activity, banking activity, the , the success in vaccination."
" Home prices are rising , 9 percent  in some areas, because of low interest rates."
 There was a lot of pent -up demand.
" So there ’s just—there’s  a—there’s a one -time shift in demand that we think will get satisfied —also , that will call for th supply."
 Do we see longer -term damage to the job market?
" And , compared to previous recessions, how would you characterize the damage to the job market here , in terms of things like, you know, permanent job loss, workers that need to shift industries, that kind o f thing?"
" And, you know, they’ ve gotten a lot of support from fiscal policy and some from monetary policy."
"  I think if you look at either—look at employment gaps or unemployment gaps or wage gaps, wealth gaps, homeowning gaps, all of those persistent gaps that exist even control ling for many other factors, you will see that they ’re, they’re  persistent , they’re —and they ’re very difficult to explain."
" And so it’s —the reason we talk about inequality and, and racial inequality in particular, is that it goes to our job, which is to achieve maximum employment, which, which links up with , with—we want —we want  the potential output of the United States to be as high as it can possibly be."
" Principally , whe n we say that the maximum employment is a , a broad and inclusive goal, what we ’re—what we’re  saying there is , we’re not just going to look at the headline —and we never did, really, b ut—we ’re not going to just look at the headline numbers."
" And we ’re not going to say that we ’ve reached maximum  employment, which is our statutory goal, until we ’ve reached maximum  employment."
" The other thing, though, even conditional on that, when we saw  the wave in the S outh and the W est, the wave of cases this summer, I think , intuitively , having seen what happened in March and April, we expected there to be a significant hit to economic activity."
" You know, even purchasing manager index and sentiment indexes on, on areas of the economy that are not directly —really directly —exposed to the pandemic in their economic activity, t hey’re doing okay."
 That ’s the single most important economic growth policy that we can have.
