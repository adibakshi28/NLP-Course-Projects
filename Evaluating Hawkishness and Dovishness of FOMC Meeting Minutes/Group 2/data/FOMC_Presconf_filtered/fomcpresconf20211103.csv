" At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed to achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us:  maximum employment and price stability."
" Today, the FOMC  kept interest rates near zero and, in light of the progress the economy has made toward our goals, decided to begin reducing the pace of asset purchases."
" With these actions, monetary policy will continue to provide strong support to the economic recovery."
 I will say more about our monetary policy decisions after reviewing recent economic developments.
" Economic activity expanded at a 6.5 percent pace in the first half of the year, reflecting progress on vaccinations, the reopening of the economy, and strong policy support."
" In the third quarter, real GDP growth slowed notably from this rapid pace."
" None theless, aggregate demand has been very strong this year, buoyed by fiscal and monetary policy support and the healthy financial positions of households and businesses."
" With COVID case counts receding further  and progress on vaccinations, economic growth should pick up this quarter, resulting in strong growth for the year as a whole."
" November 3, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 2 of 29   Conditions in the labor market have continued to improve , and demand for workers remains very strong."
" As with overall economic activity, the pace of improvement slowed with the rise in COVID cases."
  The unemployment rate was 4.8 percent in September .
" This figure understates the shortfall in employment, particularly as participation in the labor market remains subdued."
 These impediments to labor supply should diminish with further progress on containing the virus —supporting gains in employment and economic activity.
 The supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemi c and the reopening of the economy have contributed to sizable price increases in some sectors.
" In particular, bottlenecks and supply chain disruptions are limiting how quickly production can respond to the rebound in demand in the near term."
" As a result , overall inflation is running well above our 2 percent longer -run goal."
" Nonetheless, it remains the case that the drivers of higher inflation have been predominantly November 3, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 3 of 29   connected to t he dislocations caused by the pandemic —specifically , the effects on supply and demand from the shutdown, the uneven reopening, and the ongoing effects of the virus itself."
" We understand the difficulties that high inflation poses for individuals and familie s, particularly those with limited means to absorb higher prices for essentials such as food and transportation."
" Like most forecasters, we continue to believe that our dynamic economy will adjust to the supply an d demand imbalances and that , as it does, inflation will decline to levels much closer to our 2 percent longer -run goal."
" Of course, it is very difficult to predict the persistence of supply constraints or their effects on inflation."
 We are committed to our longer -run goal of 2 percent inflation and to having longer -term inflation expectations well anchored at this goal.
" If we were to see si gns that the path of inflation, or [of] longer -term inflation expectations, was moving materially and persistently beyond levels consistent with our goal, we would use our tools to preserve price stability."
" The Fed’s policy actions have been guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to promote the stability of the financial system."
"Last December, th e Committee stated its intention to continue asset purchases at a pace of at least $120 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward our November 3, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 4 of 29   maximum -employment and price -stability goals."
 Our decision today to begin tapering our asset purchases does not imply any direct signal regarding our interest rate policy .
 We at the Fed will do everything we can to complete the recovery in employment and achieve our price -stability goal.
 We don’ t think it ’s time yet to raise interest rates.
" There is still ground to cover to re ach maximum employment , both in terms of employment and in terms of participation."
"  Getting to your question, our baseline expectation is that supply bottlenecks and shortages will persist well into next year, and elevated inflation as well, and that , as the pandemic subsides, supply chain bottlenecks will abate—and job growth will move back up."
" And as that happens, inflation will decline from today’ s elevated levels."
" B ut, certainly , we should see inflation moving down by the second or third quarter."
"  Based on —if I could follow up, based on your c urrent outlook for the labor market, do you think it ’s possible—or likely , even —that maximum employment could be achieved by the second half of next year?"
"”  Of course, we measure maximum employment based on a wide range of figures, but it’s certainly within the real m of possibility."
" Obviously, we ’re seeing strong wage growth, particularly for people in sort of lowerincome fields."
" Now, in real terms, they ’ve been —they had been running a little bit below inflation, so real wages were not really increasi ng."
" You know, the concern is  a somewhat unusual case where, if wages were to be rising persistently and materially above inflation and productivity gains, that could put upward pressure on, or downward pressure  on margins and cause companies to —or employers , really —to raise prices as a result, and you can see yourself, find yourself in what we used to call a wage –price spiral."
 Productivity has been very high.
 I wonder if you could perhaps give us your thinking about the tradeoffs between inflation and unemployment.
" You talked about the shortfall of unemployment —reemployment relative to befo re the pandemic, and yet you have inflation, which is affecting everybody."
" Are we at , or close to , a point where the risk of inflation is greater than the benefit that you ’d—for recovering these lost jobs so that now , from a risk -management standpoint, it makes sense to move more aggressively on rate hikes?"
  And k ind of a related question:  T he statement today says you’ ll keep policy accommodative until you hit that 2 percent  inflation target.
" Our surveys show looking for 5 per cent inflation this year, 3 ½ percent  next year —it sure seems like you ’re on track to modestly or moderately exceed that 2 percent  target."
" The idea that the tradeoff between inflation and unemployment, that you would keep policy accommodative to put this 5 million folks, or find these 5 million jobs  again, at the same time all Americans will be suffering from higher inflation —is that tradeoff worth it, or is it better or smarter to raise rates right now to combat inflation and perhaps not lean so heavily on the employment side of the mandate?"
" The inflation that November 3, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 8 of 29   we’re seeing is really not due to a tight labor market."
" It ’s due to bottlene cks, and it ’s due to shortages, and it ’s due to very strong demand meeting those."
"  But, you know, in this situation, we do have a provision in our S tatement o n Longer -Run Goals, as you know, that says when those two things are in tension, what we do is , we take into account the employment shortfalls and inflation deviations and the potentially different time horizons over  which employment and inflation are projected to retur n to levels judged consistent with the mandate."
 We have to be aware of the risks that we’ re—particularly now the risk of significantly higher inflation.
" We see higher inflation persisting, and we have to be in position to address that risk should it become really a threat to —should it create a threat of more persistent, longerterm inflation ."
" You mentioned at the beginning that the F ed understands the difficulties that high inflation poses for individuals and families, especially those with limited means."
" What is your message to t hose November 3, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 10 of 29   families or consumers that are struggling with higher prices right now, and do you feel that your expectations around transitory inflation, that message is reaching them?"
" So, first of all, it is our job to —and we accept responsibility and accountability for inflation in the medium term."
 We’ re accountable to Congress and to the American people for maximum employment and price stability.
 The level of inflation we have right now is not at all consistent with price stability.
"  By the way, we ’re also not at maximum employment, as I mentioned."
 So I would want to assure people that we will use our tools as appropriate to get inflation under control.
"  We don’ t think it ’s a good time to raise interest rates, though, because we want to see the labor market heal further ."
"  Really , for us, what “ transitory ” has meant is that if something is transitory, it will not leave behind it permanently or very persistently higher inflation."
" We said that “supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic and the reopening of the economy have contributed to sizable price increases,”  and we said , “Progress on vaccinations and an easing of supply constraints are expected to support continued gains in November 3, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 11 of 29   economic activity and employment as well as a reduction in inflation."
" R eally , that’s one of our principal jobs, along with achieving maximum employment ."
" You talked about getting back to full employment, and so could you update how you define that?"
" So can you give us some examples of things you're looking at , specifically , to measure full employment ?"
" Will you be looking at prime -age employment population ratio, for example, and, if so, do you need to see it get back to preCOVID levels to achieve maximum employment, or is there something short of that that would work?"
" So maximum employment is, it ’s a broad —what would we say?—broad -based and inclusive goal that ’s not directly measurable and changes over time due to various factors."
"  So it ’s taking into account quite a broad range of things, and, of course, employment —levels of employment —[and]  participation are a part of that."
  We knew that w as achievable in a context of low inflation.
" You know, we thought that schools reopening and elapsing unemployment benefits would produce some sort of additional labor supply."
" So I think there ’s room for a whole lot of humility here , as we try to think about what maximum employment would be."
"  Now, what we also have now , though, is , we hav e high inflation."
" So we have a completely different situation now where we have high inflation, and we have to balance that with what ’s going on in the employment market."
" So, give n that answer about employment , I would like to get back to Steve ’s question a little bit."
" On a headline basis, just as it ’s evolved this year, do you feel that the two tests on inflation have been met?"
" When we reach maximum employment, when we reach a state where labor market conditions are at maximum employment in the Committee ’s judgment, it ’s very possible that the inflation test will already be met."
" We’re aware that that language sounds, it sounds a little out of touch with what ’s going on, but , you know, we ’re not at maximum employment."
" When that is the case, we’ll look to see whether the inflation test is met, and there ’s a good chance that it will be if you look at how inflation has evolved in the last year and a half."
"  So, to follow up, so you’ re not willing to commit that the current levels of inflation and their persistence have met “moderately ” and “ for some time."
" We have not focused on whether we meet the liftoff test , because we don’t meet the liftoff test now because we’ re not at maximum employment."
"  What I ’m saying is, given where inflation is and where it ’s projected to be, let ’s say we do mee t the maximumemployment test ."
" Then the Committee —the question for the Committee  at that time will be , has the inflation test been met ?"
" We did talk about the economy and the development of the economy, but we didn’ t ask ourselves whether the liftoff test is met, because, you know, it ’s clearly not met on the maximum -employment side."
" So, when you’ re looking at this question of assessing whether or not the U.S. economy is at maximum employment, do you have a framework for making that judgment that is independent of what inflation is doing?"
" And , if not, does it kind of complicate that assessment, given all of the uncertainty about inflation right now and the inclination to believe that, you know, the high inflation we ’re seeing is not related to capacity utilization in the labor  market ?"
" So we don’ t actually define maximum employment as —we define it in terms of inflation, but , of course, there is a connection there."
 Maximum employment has to be a level that is consistent with stable prices.
 We think about maximum employment as looking at a broad range of things.
" You can’ t just look at—unlike inflation, where you can have a number ."
" But with maximum employment, you could be in a situation , hypothetically, w here the unemployment rate is low, but there are many people who are out of the labor force and will come back in."
" And so you wouldn’ t really be at maximum employment , because there’ s this group that isn ’t counted as unemployed."
" And it ’s clear th at there are, you know —with tremendous demand for workers and wages moving up, it does seem like we ’re set up to go back to a higher jobcreation  rate."
 So that would suggest that you’ re not at maximum employment.
" But, of course, at the end of it, it also has to be a level of employment that ’s consistent with price stability."
" Could you talk a little bit about what the F ed’s process for balancing those two goals would be in the event that, say, come next year , you decide there ’s a serious risk of persistent inflationary pressures despite ongoing employment shortfalls?"
" For now , it appears to be skewed toward higher inflation."
 It stopped that transitio n away from a goods -focused economy where there ’s excess demand for goods because ther e—services are not available.
" That transition itself could help bring inflation down, because , presumably , people would spend a little less on goods while they start spending more on travel and all sorts of travel services and things like that."
" So we want to see that healthy process unfold as we decide what the true state of the economy is, and we think it will evolve in a way that will mean lower inflation."
" Mr. Chairman, the critics of your patience policy argue that , given the long and variable lags with which monetary policy works, that you are likely to end up, given inflation, by having to raise rates faster and farther than you would have liked and, therefore , send the economy into recession."
" Given the  fact that , basically , your forecast has been chasing inflation over the last year, and now you’ re talking about it not coming down until the second or third quarter , why would they be wrong in thinking that?"
" Well, so, let me say what ’s hap pened— and we ’re very, very straightforward about it —is that inflation has come in  higher than expected, and bottlenecks have been more persistent and more prevalent."
 A nd the r eason is that there ’s still ground to cover to get to maximum employment .
"  And, you know, I think, you know, the bottlenecks that we ’re seeing in global supply chains around goods and, frankly , now at our own domestic ports, because demand is stronger than the capacity of those ports —those things are going to work themselves out."
" But, you know, we are prepared for different eventualities, and we will use our tools to achieve price stability and maximum employment ."
 Our policy will adapt —and has already  adapted —to the changing understanding of inflation and of bottlenecks and the whole supplyside story —which is also partly a demand story.
 We were much farther away from maximum employment.
 Inflation was much lower.
" This is an economy where demand is very, very strong, very strong, and job openings substantially exceed the number of unemployed people."
"  I mean , after we began that taper, it was  still many years before we reached what I would characterize as conditions consistent with maximum employment, let alone  price stability."
" It’ s earlier and faster, and that ’s because our, as I mentioned, ou r policy has been adapting to the situation as it evolves, as it ’s clarifying itself, and that ’s partly because we see inflation coming in higher —so."
" So lower rates encourage more borrowing, encourage more economic activity."
" B ut most people  November 3, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 23 of 29   find—most of the findings are that it does support economic activity in the way that you would expect, whic h is to say, at the margin, more economic activity with lower rates, which is why we do what we do."
" More accommodative  financial conditions lead to more economic activity , over time, with a lag ."
" Chair, I just want to dig a little bit deeper on employment."
 Is there any feel ing there that maybe you’ ve been accused of “fighting the last war ”—that perhaps the labor dynamics have changed in the post -COVID environment and that full employment may not look like what it looked like before?
" They ’re quitting their jobs in all -timehigh numbers —but , in many cases, going back into employment and getting higher wages."
" So in terms of full employment, as I discussed earlier, I think , at the very beginning of the recove ry, the natural thing to do was to look back at labor conditions, labor market conditions in February of 2010, at the end of the longest expansion in our history."
" You know, an economy w here inflation was driven by services is now inflation where —all the inflation is in goods, which have had negative inflation for a quarter -century."
  So you ask about full employment .
" I mean , one thing we ’ll learn, I think, I hope we ’ll learn in the next, in the near term is, once the D elta variant really does continue to decline, what’ s going to happen to employment?"
