" Inflation is much too high, and we understand the hardship it is causing, and we’re moving expeditiously to bring it back down."
 It is essential that we bring inflation down if we are to have a sustained perio d of strong labor market conditions that benefit all.
"From the standpoint of our Congressional mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability , the current picture is plain to see:  The labor market is extremely tight, and inflation is much too high."
" Against this backdrop, today the  FOMC  raised its policy interest rate by ½ percentage point  and anticipates that ongoing increases in the target rate for the federal funds rate will be appropriate."
 I’ll have more to say about today’s monetary policy actions after briefly reviewing economic developments.
"After expanding at a robust 5½ percent pace last year, overall economic activity edged down in the f irst quarter."
" Underlying momentum remains strong, however, as the decline largely reflected swings in inventories and net exports —two volatile categories whose movements last quarter likely carry little signal for future growth."
" Over the first t hree months of the year, employment rose by nearly 1.7 million jobs."
" In March , the unemployment rate hit a p ostpandemic, and near -fivedecade, low of 3.6 percent ."
" Labor demand is very strong, and, while labor force participation has increased somewhat , labor supply remains subdued."
 Inflation remains well above our longer -run goal of 2 percent .
 The surge in prices of crude oil and other commodities that resul ted from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is creating additional upward pressure on inflation.
" In addition to the effects on inflation, the invasion and related events are likely to restrain economic activity abroad and further disrupt supply chains, creat ing spillovers to the U.S. economy through trade and other channels."
" May 4, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 3 of 24   The Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for t he American people."
" My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship, especially on those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation."
" We are highly attentive to the risks  that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are strongly committed to restoring price stability."
" At today’s  meeting , the Committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by ½ percentage point and stated that it “ anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate.”   We also decided to begin the process of reducing the size of our balance sheet, which will play an important role in firming the stance of monetary policy."
 Our overarching focus is using our tools to bring inflation back down to our 2 percent goal .
 Our balance sheet decis ions are guided by our maximum -employment and price -stability goals .
Making appropriate monetary policy in this uncertai n environment requires a recognition that the economy often evolves in unexpected ways.
" Inflation has obviously surprised to the upside over the past year, and further surprises could be in store."
 We are highly attentive to inflation  risks .
 The American economy is very strong and well positioned to handle tighter monetary policy.
 We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum -employment and price -stability goals.
" Chair Powell, the unemployment rate at 3.6 percent in March is now essentially at the level that the Committee had expected would prevail over the next three years a nd at the bottom end of FOMC participants ’ May 4, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 5 of 24   projections for the longer -run rate that you submitted in the projection s at the last meeting."
 How has your outlook for further declines in the unemployment rate changed since March?
  What does this imply for your inflation forecast?
 So  you’ re right —3.6 percent unemployment is just about as low as it ’s been in 50 years.
" And that will, of course , tend to hold the unemployment rate up a little bit."
 So it is certainly possible that the unemployment would go down further.
" Implications for inflation —really , the wages matter a fair amount for companies, particularly in the service sector."
 And that ’s because of an imbalance between supply and demand in the labor market.
" So we think through our policies —through fur ther healing in the labor market, higher rates, for example , of vacancy filling and things like that, and more people coming back in—we ’d like to think that supply and demand will come back into balance  and that, therefore, wage inflation will moderate to still May 4, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 6 of 24   high levels of wage increases, but ones that are more consistent with 2 percent inflation."
" There’ s a path by which we would be able to have demand moderate in the labor market and therefore have vacancies come down without unemployment going up, because vacancies are at such an extraordinarily high level."
" So , in principle, it seems as though by moderating demand, we could see vacancies come down a nd, as a result —and they could come down fairly signif icantly a nd, I think, put supply and demand at least closer together than they are."
" And that would give us a chance to get inflation down, get wages down, and then get inflation down without having to slow the economy and have a recession and have unemployment rise materially."
" T herefore, the economy is strong and is well positioned to handle tighter monetary policy."
" And, you know, I think expectations are that we ’ll start to see inflation, you know, flattening out —and not necessarily declining yet , but we ’ll see more evidence."
" We’ve seen some evidence that core PCE inflation is perhaps either reaching a peak May 4, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 8 of 24   or flattening out."
" I’m sorry, but if inflation is lower one month and the unemployment rate higher, would that be something that we would calibrate toward a lower increase in the funds rate?"
" You know, we ‘d want to see evidence that inflation is moving in a direction that gives us more comfort."
" As I said, we ’ve got two months now where core inflation is a little lower, but we ’re not looking at tha t as a reason to take some comfort."
" You know, I think we need to really see that our expectation is being fulfilled—t hat inflation, in fact, is under control and starting to come down."
" Given the expectation that inflation will remain well above the Fed ’s target at year -end, what constitutes a neutral policy setting in terms of the fed funds rate?"
" When we talk about the neutral rate, we ’re really talking about the rate that neither pushes economic activity higher nor slows it down."
 That’s an estimate for an economy that ’s at full employment and 2 percent inflation.
" Do you see evidence that inflationary psychology is changing in areas like workers ’ wage demands, businesses ’ May 4, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 10 of 24   willingness to raise prices?"
 Do you see evidence that there is a psychological shift going on on inflation?
"  I think if you look at short -term inflation expectations, they ’re quite elevated."
" And you can look at that and say, “Well, that’ s because people expect inflation to come down.”   And , in fact, i nflation expectations [at longer horizons] come down fairly sharply."
" Longer -term inflation expectations have been reasonably stable but have moved up to—but only to levels where they were in 2014, by some measures."
 And we can ’t allow inflation expectations to become unanchored.
  You mentioned in the statement both the upside risks to inflation from Russia and China.
" Obviously, those are very much supply shocks rather than demand side."
 Our tools work on demand.
 But there ’s a job to do on demand.
" And that —you can see that in the labor market , where demand is substantially in excess of supply of workers."
" For both the situation in Ukraine and the situation in China, they’ re likely to , both, add to headline inflation."
" So they’ re going to weigh on the process of global supply chain healing, which is going to affect broader inflation, too."
" I want to follow up on that, because you all have obviously highlighted that there are both supply and demand issues at play in inflation."
" And I ’m just wondering, you know, if these supply chain issues continue because of Russia, because of China, or just because these things take a while to work out , does getting back down to your 2 percent mandate require that the supply chain i ssues get resolved, since you can only handle the demand side, as you said?"
" Or will you have to crimp demand maybe even further if the supply chain issues don’ t resolve themselves , in order to try and get inflation back down to where you want it to be?"
" So, you know, I ’ll just say :  For now, we ’re focused on doing the job we need to do on demand, and there ’s plenty to be done there."
 There’ s a lot of excess demand.
 What would you like to see that come down to to think that you’ re in sort  of a noninflationary vacancyto-unemployed rate?
" And, secondly, on help from inflation, how much are you counting on wealth effects through stock market channels?"
" Okay, so in terms of the vacanc iesto-unemployment ratio, we don’ t have a goal in mind."
" We ’re looking at wages , and we’ re looking at , ultimately , inflation."
" A nd some of us are old enough to have lived through high inflation, and many aren ’t."
" And it ’s our job to make sure that inflation of that unpleasant , high nature doesn’ t get entrenched in  the economy."
" And the way we do that is , we try to get supply and demand back in sync with each other, back in balance, so that the economy is under less stress and inflation will go down."
"  We think we have a good chance to do it without a significant increase in unemployment or, you know, a really sharp slowdown."
" Are you concerned , with this high level of inflation , that the consumer will stop spending—and what ’s the level of your concern— pushing us into a recession?"
 W e expect growth to be solid this year.
" Now, of course, given events around the world and fading fiscal policy effects and higher rates, you could see some slower economic activity."
" Certainly , it will not be —last year was an extraordinarily strong growth year as we recovered from the pandemic ."
" As I mentioned, growth [was] over 5 percent."
" But most forecasters have growth this year at, you know, at a solid pace above 2 percent."
 But we ’ve talked with economists who have advised Democrat s and R epublican P residents who both said that the Fed is so far behind the curve on inflation that a recession is inevitable.
" So, and as I said, I think we have a good chance to restore price stability without a recession —without, you know, a severe downturn;  without materially high, higher unemployment."
" So , typically , in a recession, you would have unemployment."
 Now you have surplus demand.
" So there should be room , in principle, to reduce that surplus demand without putting people out of work."
" We have, essentially , interest rates, the balance sheet, and forward guidance, and they ’re famously blunt tools."
 Do you feel that the Fed has been supported enough from polici es at the White House and in Congress in combating inflation?
" And we look at it as our job, given all the factors that are happening , to try to sustain maximum employment and price stability."
"  So if Congress or the A dministration has ways to help with inflation, I would encourage that, but I ’m not going to get into making recommendations or anything like that."
" When we get inflation back under control, then maybe I can, you know, give other people advice  [laughter] ."
 A number of your colleagues have said that the rates will need to go above neutral into a restrictive territory to bring down inflation.
" And , two, you’ ve recently spoke n in great praise of Paul Volcker, who had the courage to bring inflation down with recessions in the 1980s."
 And while it ’s certainly not your desire —the soft landing is the big hope of everyone —would this FOMC have the courage to endure recession s to bring inflation down if that were the only way necessary?
" So , basically , we’ve been hit by historically large inflationary shocks since the pandemic."
" This is , we have a pandemic, we have the highest unemployment, you know, in—since the Depress ion."
 Then we have this outsize d response from fiscal policy and monetary policy.
 Then we have inflation .
 So it ’s been a series of inflationary shocks that are really different from anything people have seen in 40 years.
" Given where inflation is and the hot economy is —or, certainly , the hot labor market, as you May 4, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 19 of 24   described it —why still the hesitation?"
" And do you have another, a newer or a better , estimate for the monetary policy impact of letting the balance sheet decline?"
" And, you know, our strategy is to set up a plan and have it operate and really have, you know, have the  interest rate be the active tool of monetary policy."
" In terms of speaking to the American people , so I feel like sometimes I just want to remind us , really , that that’ s who we work for, and that it ’s inflation that people are feeling all over the country."
" I t’s—monetary policy is working through e xpectations now, to a very large extent."
" To expand on Steve ’s question about Paul Volcker , there was also a great pain that came with that as well —higher interest rates, obviously affecting households and businesses."
 I’m wondering how you kind of square what might be demand disruption.
" Well, so , as I mentioned, you can see places where the demand is substantially in excess of supply."
" And what you’ re seeing as a result of that is prices going up and at unsustainable levels , levels that are not consistent with 2 percent inflation."
" And so what our tools do is that as we raise interest rates, demand moderates :  it moves down."
" Interest rates, you know —businesses will invest a little bit less, consumers will spend a little bit less."
" But , ultimately, getting those, getting supply and demand back, you know, back in balance, is what gives us 2 percent inflation, which is what gives the economy a footing where people can lead successful economic lives and not worry about infla tion."
" But, you know, the big pain over time is in not dealing with inflation and allowing it to become entrenched."
" And inflation —month by month, inflation had com e down till September, a few months in a row , stayed low."
" And by the way—then , with the restatement of the jobs numbers, it looked like the job market was much more even and stronger in the second half of the year."
" Anyway, we got an ECI reading—e mployment compensation, [employment cost]  index reading— the Friday before the November meeting."
" Chair Powell, I  want to ask how you’ re able to balance your dual mandate—stable prices and maximum employment —especially when the unemployment rate for B lack workers is still roughly double , roughly twice the rate for white workers."
 So unemployment rates for all racial groups have come down a lot and are now much closer to where they were before the pandemic hit.
" And companies can’ t hire , and wa ges are moving up at levels that would not , over time, be consistent with 2 percent inflation over time."
" And it ’s a great thing, but you want them to go up at a sustainable level , because these wages are, to some extent, being eaten up by inflation."
" A nd we ’ve got to get back to price stability so that we can have a labor market where people’ s wages aren ’t being eaten up by inflation and where we can have a long expa nsion, too."
"history have been in the last 40 years, and that ’s May 4, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 24 of 24   because it ’s been a time of low inflation."
