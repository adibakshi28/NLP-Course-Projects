"At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed to achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us:  maximum employment a nd price stability ."
" Today, in support of these goals, the FOMC raised its policy interest rate by ¼ percentage point ."
" The economy is very strong, and against the backdrop of a n extremely tight labor market and high inflation, the Committee anticipates th at ongoing increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate ."
"Economic activity expanded at a robust 5½ percent pace last year, reflecti ng progress on vaccinations and the reopening of the economy, fiscal and monetary policy support, and the healthy financial positions of households and businesses ."
 The rapid spread of the Omicron variant led to some slowing in economic activity early this  year .
" Although the invasion of Ukraine and related events represent a downside risk to the outlook for economic activity, FOMC participants continue t o foresee solid growth."
" A s shown in our Summary of Economic Projections, the median projection for real GDP growth stands at 2.8 percent this year , 2.2 percent next year, and 2 percent in 2024."
" Over the first two months of the year, employment rose by more than a million jobs ."
" In February, the March 16, 20 22   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 2 of 26   unemployment rate hit a post -pandemic low of 3.8 percent, a bit below the median of Committee participants ’ estimates of its longer -run normal level ."
" Labor demand is very strong, and while labor force participation has increased somewhat , labor supply remains subdued."
" FOMC participants expect the labor market to remain strong, with the median projection for the unemployment rate declining to 3.5 percent by the end of this year  and remaining near that level thereafter."
 Inflation remains well above our longerrun goal of 2 percent .
" Aggregate demand is strong, a nd bottlenecks and supply constraints are limiting how quickly production can respond."
" Additionally, higher energy prices are driving up overall inflation."
 The surge in prices of crude oil and other commodities that resulted from Russia ’s invasion of Ukraine will put additional upward pressure on near -term inflation here at home .
"We understand that high inflation imposes significant hardship, especially on those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation."
" As we emphasize in our policy statement, w ith appropriate firming in the stance of monetary policy, we expect inflation to return to 2  percen t while the labor market remain s stron g."
" That said, inflation is likely to take longer to return to our price -stability goal than previously expected."
" The median inflation March 16, 20 22   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 3 of 26   projection of FOMC participants is 4.3 percent this year and falls to 2.7 percent next year  and 2.3 percent in 2024; this trajectory is notably higher tha n projected in December, and participants continue to see risks as weighted to the upside ."
The Fed ’s monetary policy actions have been guided by our mandate to promote maximum employme nt and stable prices for the American people.
 Reducing the size of our balance sheet will also play an important role in firming the stance of monetary policy .
" In making decisions about interest rates and the balance sheet, we will be mindful o f the broader context in markets and in the economy, and we will use our tools to support financial and macroeconomic stability ."
" In addition to the direct effects from higher global oil and commodity prices, the invasion and related events may restrain economic activity abroad and further disrupt supply chains —which would create spillovers to the U.S ."
Making appropriate monetary policy in this environment requires a recognition that the economy often evolves in unexpected ways .
 We are attentive to the risks of potential further upward pressure on inflation and inflation expectations .
 We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum -employment and price -stability goals .
" I wonder if you could detail your thinking a little bit about how you’ re considering the , you know, the risks of going too fast and potentially tipping the economy into recession and how you’ re weighing those risks against the possibility of going too slowly, allowing inflation to become embedded, and kind of getting “ behind the curve.”  CHAIR POWELL ."
" Aggregate demand is currently st rong, and most forecasters expect it to remain so ."
" Conditions are tight, and payroll job growth is March 16, 20 22   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 5 of 26   continuing at very high levels ."
" And so all signs are that  this is a strong economy and, indeed, one that will be able to flourish —not to say withstand , but certainly  flourish —as well in the face of less accommodative monetary policy ."
 But we do feel the economy is very strong and well positioned to withstand tighter monetary policy.
" You talk about monetary policy operating with a lag, but is this going to bite quicker than expected?"
" I don’ t think —I mean, I think, generally, monetary policy works with a lag, so some of that would also be in there ."
"But remember, a s well, that 2.8 percent  is still very strong growth ."
" If we think that the potential growth rate of the economy is somewhere between , somewhere around 1.75 percent , 2.8 percent  is strong economic growth."
" So , while it’ s lower than last year ’s 5.8 percent , it’s still quite strong growth ."
" I’m curious if you can be specific on when you expect to see inflation will start to come down, especially with the combination of rates going up, fiscal aid dissipating from the economy, and supply chains getting better?"
" I would have said that the expectation was that inflation would peak sometime in the first quarter, maybe the end of the first quarter of this year, and then maybe stay at that level or a little bit lower and then start to come down in the back half of the year."
" So now we ’re, you know, we ’re getting —we ’re going—we ’re already seeing a little bit of short -term upward pressure in inflation due to higher  oil prices, natural gas  [prices]  a little bit but not so much for us since we have our own natural gas supply, other commodities prices ."
 So I guess I would say that the expectation i s still that inflation will begin to come down in the second half of the year.
" But if you look at where I read the SEP headline median , we still expect inflation to be high this year, lower than last year, and then we expect —though, particularly with the effects of the war , but also the data we ’ve seen so far this year —we expect inflation to remain high through the middle of the year, begin to come down, and then come down more sharply next year ."
 Most officials weren ’t projecting any interest rate increases this year .
 So how concerned are you that further inflation surprises will offset the effects of recent policy firming by leading real rates  to stay at levels that do not actually provide much restraint to the economy?
 We expect growth to continue .
 As I—it’s clearly time to raise interest rates and begin th e balance sheet shrinkage.
" But if you go out a year or two, many people are , in their forecasts , are having tight policy from a real interest rate standpoint."
" So , looking at the Summary of E conomic Projections, you all have inflation coming down over the course of the year to 4.3 percent ."
" So I was just wondering, how much of inflation coming down do you see as actually being as a result of the Fed itself raising rates?"
" My first question is , how much do you expect inflation to come down as a dire ct result of the Fed ’s actions?"
" So part of inflation coming down at the very beginning is clearly to do with factors other than our policy, and those would include , potentially , the supply chain is getting a little bit better, certain ly base effects."
" You ’re lapping— as you know, when you look at a 12 -month trailing window, you’ re lapping very high inflation in March, April, May, June of last year ."
" Really what we ’re looking for, though, is monthby-month inflation coming down."
"You know, I think monetary policy starts to bite on inflation, and on growth, with a lag, of course ."
 We’ll be looking to see whether the data show expected improvement on inflation .
 We’ ll be looking at the inflation outlook and making a judgement .
" And if we conclude that it would be appropriate to raise interest rates more quickly, then we’ ll do so."
" The last time the CPI inflation —I know you look at PCE, but CPI inflation— was as high as it is was July of 1981, when the effective federal funds rate was 19.2  percent ."
" But given the current data, how far behind the curve of inflation do you believe the Federal Reserve is, in your mind?"
" And , as you can see, we have a plan over the course of this year to raise interest rates steadily and also to run off the balance sheet ."
" We wi ll take the necessary steps to ensure that high inflation does not become entrenched, while also supporting a strong labor market."
" —t he impact that —given you’ re not actually confirmed and Governor Brainard is not actually confirmed, has there been any impact on your job or the Fed’s ability to handle inflation?"
" Chair Powell, how concerned is the Committee about the notable pickup in services inflation, which is perhaps less likely to self -correct?"
 And to what extent does it alter both the Committee ’s confidence that longterm inflation expectations will not de -anchor in the coming months as well as the balance of risks that the Fed  may need to raise interest rates further above neutral than indicated in the dot plot ?
" We have expected services inflation to move back up to where it was, and that ’s part of what ’s happening is, in the case of some services, prices are still getting back up to where they were before the crisis."
" In other cases, it ’s pretty clear that inflation has spread more broadly across services."
" As I look at the median forecast, for example, for unemployment, it runs for the three -year window below the longrun rate ."
" I look at inflation March 16, 20 22   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 13 of 26   being above , over the three -year window , the longrun—or call it th e neutral —rate, so the economy still runs hot ."
"I guess my question is this:  Are you not create —giving a forecast here that essentially suggests you will be continuing to run further “ behind the curve ”—and never really get in front of inflation , because the economy will continue to run hot?"
" And, if so, why are you making that choice to let inflation run above price stability longer than you ’d like?"
" But if you look, people do have their in —by  the end of this year, broadly, people are at or close to or, in some cases, above their estimates of longer -run neutral interest rate ."
" So that should stop pushing —that should, in other words, that should be a removal of accommodation for monetary policy, basically ."
 So why does unemployment remain at 3.5 percent ?
" One is the connection between—in the economy we had before the pandemic, the connection between inflation and the level of the unemployment rate was not very tight."
" March 16, 20 22   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 14 of 26   But this is —clearly , what this is is an expectation that, really it amounts to that , the idea that wage increases, which are now running above the level that would be consistent over the long run with 2 percent  inflation, will move back down to levels which are still very attractive, fulleconomy kind of —full -employment kind of wages , but not to a point where they ’re pushing up inflation anymore ."
" And , as I mentioned, there are a lot of factors causing inflation to come down."
" But no matter what happens, this is a C ommittee that is determined to use its tools to make sure that higher inflation does not become entrenched ."
" I mean, there are a lot of economists skeptical that you can reduce inflation as much as you ’ve penciled in without raising the unemployment rate ."
" And I ’m wondering, just what are the mechanisms you see in reducing demand?"
"  I mean, outside housing and autos, how do higher fed [funds] rates reduce consumer demand unless it ’s through higher unemploym ent?"
" So, in principle, if  you were —let ’s say that our tools work about as you described, and the idea is, we ’re trying to better align demand and supply, let’s just say in the labor market."
" And , basically , across the economy, we’ d like to slow demand so that it’ s better aligned with supply; give supply, at the same time, time to recover; and get into a better, you know, a better alignment of supply and demand."
" And that , over time , should bring inflation down."
" You know, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, without price stability, there —you really can ’t have a sustained period of maximum employment ."
 And what would that mean for wages and inflation?
"And it also will, we think, help relieve some of the wage pressures that do put inflation more at risk ."
" But, in principle, it ought to help with inflation as well."
" It’s not the only thing we ’re looking for, though, from inflation."
" And remember that the financial conditions we had for the last couple of years were a function not only of very aggressive , and appropriately so, fiscal policy , but also highly accommodative monetary policy— the monetary policy settings that we put in place at the worst parts of the pandemic ."
"And, yes, that will lead to some tightening in financial conditions in the form of higher interest rates and just the sorts of things —we ’re not targeting any one or more of those things, but financial conditions generally should move to a more normal le vel so that —because we know the economy no longer needs , or wants , these very highly accommodative, this  stance, which , you know, so it ’s time to move to a more normal setting of financial conditions, and we do that by moving monetary policy itself to more  normal levels."
" And, of course, when we tighten monetary policy, we do expect that they will adjust in sync over time with monetary policy."
" Mr. Chairman, since September of 2020, you’ ve been operating on a monetary policy framework that let the economy run hot to bring unemployment down."
 What is it that the F ed is trying to do other than bring inflation down?
 A nd that is that nothing in our new framework or in the changes that we made has caused us to wait longer to raise interest rates .
" What we said was, if we see, you know, low unemployment, high employment , but we don’ t see inflation, then we ’re not going to raise rates ’ til we actually see inflation ."
" There was no sense in which, if we got a burst of really high inflation, we would wait to raise rates."
 The framework is all about anchoring inflation expectations at 2  percent .
" It was a sudden, unexpected burst of inflation."
" Yes, there are threats to growth March 16, 20 22   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 20 of 26   from, you know, from what ’s going on in Eastern Europe ."
" And, but, nonetheless, in the base case, there ’s a pretty broad expectation of strong growth."
But inflation is far above our target.
" If I could follow up by asking—I guess what you’ d call it i s the “Paul Volcker ” question :  You don’ t think unemployment is going to rise significantly , but, if it does, does that temper your desire to keep raising rates?"
" But we do understand also that, really, you can’ t have maximum employment for any sustained period without price stability ."
 We feel like the economy can handle tighter monetary policy .
 How is the 25 basis point hike today and then the signaling on future F ed policy going to address the inflation that they ’re feeling at the sto res on a daily basis?
 So I guess I ’d start by just assuring everyone that we ’re fully committed to bringing inflation back down and also sustaining the economic expansion.
" And, really, high inflation takes a toll on everyone ."
" But it ’s really , especially , on people who use most of their income to buy essentials like food, housing, and transportation, where —I mean, we ’ve all  seen charts that show, if you’ re a middle -income person, you’ ve got room to absorb some inflation."
" But we do anticipate that inflation will move back down, as I mentioned earlier ."
" It may take longer than we like, but I ’m confident that we ’ll use our tools to bring inflation down."
" So the way that works , I would explain, is, as we raise interest rates, that should gradually slow down demand for the interest -sensitive parts of the economy ."
" And so what we would see is demand slowing down, but just enough so that it ’s better match ed with supply."
 And that brings —that will bring inflation down over time .
 What is your message to consumers out there who can no longer afford the basics due to this high inflation?
 I’m old enough to remember what very high inflation was like .
" And, you know, we ’re strongly committed as a C ommittee to not allowing this higher inflation to become entrenched and to use our tools to bring inflation back down to more nor mal levels, which —our target is 2 percent inflation ."
"And I just would want people to understand that, and that ’s—but the way we do that is by raising interest rates and by shrinking our balance sheet ."
" And so financial conditions will become, at the margin, less supportive of various kinds of economic activity."
" And that means the economy, we think, can handle interest rate increases."
" Well, I , you know, I say that our intention is to bring inflation back down to 2 percent , while still sustaining a strong labor market and that the economy is very strong."
" If you look at where forecasts are, people are forecasting growth that ’s strong within the context of U .S."
" But we do believe that our policy is the appropriate one for this forecast, and we believe that we can bring down inflation ."
 So this is a situation where demand is higher than supply.
 And they—so we need to use our tools to move supply and demand back.
 Sorry to take you away from inflation for one minute .
" And , generally , it’s driven over long periods by rising productivity."
" But right now, they’ re all showing the same thing, which is that the increases —not the levels , but the i ncreases—are running at levels that are well above what would be consistent with 2 percent  inflation, our goal , over time ."
" But it comes back to, you know, what I ’m saying here —which is , there ’s a misalignment of demand and supply, March 16, 20 22   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 25 of 26   particularly in the labor market."
 And that is leading to wages moving up at ways  that are not consistent with 2 percent  inflation over time .
" And so we need to use our tools to, you know, guide inflation back down to 2 percent ."
" We think this labor market can  handle, as I mentioned, tighter monetary policy."
"But, ye s, wages are moving up faster than is consistent with 2 percent  inflation, but it ’s good to see that moving up."
 And that ’s because of this misalignment between supply and demand.
" So I think if we March 16, 20 22   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 26 of 26   knew now —of course, if we knew now that these supply blockages , really , and the inflation resulting from them in collision with, you know, very strong demand, if we kne w that that was what was going to happen, then in hindsight, yes ."
 We’ re not going to let high inflation become entrenched .
" No one wants to have to really put restrictive monetary policy on, in order to get inflation back down."
" And, as you can see, it is appropriate in the sense t hat, [in] people ’s [contributions to the] SEPs , they do write down levels  of interest rates that are above their estimate of the longer -run neutral rate ."
