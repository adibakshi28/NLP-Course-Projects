" Inflation has c ontinued to run  below our longerrun objective, but some of the downward pressure  on inflation re sulting from e arlier sharp declines in energy prices is abating."
 Let me emphasize that the importance of  the initial increase should no t be overstated:  The stance of monetary policy will likely remain highly accommodative for qui te some time after the initial increase in the federal funds rat e in order to s upport continue d progress toward our objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.
" Growth in household spending slowed, business fixed investment edged down, and net export s were a substantial drag on growth."
" Looking ahead, the Committee still expects a moderate p ace of GDP growth, with continuing job gains and lower energy prices supporting househo ld spending."
"The labor market data so far this year have shown further progr ess toward our objective of maximum employment, although a t a slower pace than late last  year."
" Over the past three months, job gains have averaged about 210,000 per month, down f rom an average pace of 280,000 per month over the second hal f of last year, but still well above the pace consistent with trend labor force growth."
" Alt hough the unemployment rate, at 5 .5 percent in May, was unchanged from the latest readi ng available at the time of our April meeting, the labor force participation rate edged up."
 A broader measure of unemployment  that includes individuals who want and are available to wor k but have not actively searched r ecently and people who are working part time but would rather work full time has continued  to improve.
" But it seems likely that some cyclical weakness in the labor market remains:  The p articipation rate remains below most estimates of its underlyi ng trend, involuntary parttime e mployment remains elevated, and wage growth remains relat ively subdued."
"Inflation has continued to r un below our longerrun objective, in part reflecting lower energy prices."
 Declines in import  prices have also restrained inflation.
" My colleagues and I contin ue to expect that as the effects of these transitory factors dissipa te and as the labor market impr oves further, inflation will gradually move back toward our 2 p ercent objective over the med ium term."
" Marketbased measures of inflation compensa tion remain low, though they have  risen some from their levels earlier this year, and surveyba sed measures of longerterm inf lation expectations have remained stable."
 The Committee will continue to monitor inflation devel opments carefully.
" For economic growth, participants reduced their proj ections for this year, in line w ith the disappointing data for the first quarter."
" The central tendency of  the growth projections for 20 15 is now 1.8 to 2.0 percent, down a little more than ½ percentage po int from the March projection s."
" The central tendency rises to 2.4 to 2.7 percent next year, somewhat above estimates of the l ongerrun growth rate."
 The unemployment rate projections for  this year are a little higher  than in March.
" At the end of this year, the central tendency for t he unemployment rate stands at 5.2 to 5.3 percent, a bit above participants’ estimates of the  longerrun normal unemployment r ate."
 Committee participants generally see the unemployment ra te declining a little further over the course of 2016 and 2017.
" Finally, FOMC participants projec t inflation to be quite low th is year, largely reflecting lower energy and nonenergy import prices ."
" The central tendency of t he inflation projections for this year is below 1 percent, unchanged since March."
" As the transit ory factors holding down inflation abate, the central  tendency rises to 1.6 to 1.9 perce nt next year and to 1.9 to 2.0 percent in 2017."
"Returning to monetary policy, as I noted, the Committee reaffir med its view that the current 0 to ¼ percent target ra nge for the federal funds rate remains appropriate."
" As we said in our statement, the decision to rai se the target range will depe nd on our assessment of realized and expected progress toward our o bjectives of maximum employme nt and 2 percent inflation."
" We continue to base that assessm ent on a wide range of informat ion, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of  inflation pressures and inflat ion expectations, and readings on financial and international de velopments."
" And we continue to a nticipate that it will be June 17, 2015 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL  Page 4 of 23  appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rat e when the Committee has seen further improvement in the labor  market and is reasonably confi dent that inflation will move back to its 2 percent objectiv e over the medium term."
" While the Committee views the disappoi nting economic performance in t he first quarter as largely transitory, my colleagues and I  would like to see more decisive  evidence that a moderate pace of economic growth will be sustained, so that conditions in the la bor market will continue to improve and inflation will move back to 2 percent."
"Once we begin to remove policy acc ommodation, we continue to ex pect that—as we say in our statement—“even after emp loyment and inflation are near mandateconsistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the tar get federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run.”  In other words, alt hough policy will be data dependent, economic conditions  are currently anticipated t o evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the target federal funds rate ."
"Compared with the projections mad e in March, most FOMC particip ants lowered somewhat their paths for the fede ral funds rate, consistent wit h the revisions made to the projections for GDP growth and the  unemployment rate."
"I would like to emphasize that the forecasts of the appropriate  path of the federal funds rate are conditional on participants’ individual projections of  the most likely outcomes for economic growth, employment, inflation, and other factors."
" Accordingly,  if the expansion proves to be more vigorous than currently an ticipated and inflation moves hi gher than expected, then the appropriate path would likely fo llow a steeper a nd higher traje ctory; conversely, if conditions were to prove weaker, then the a ppropriate tra jectory would be lower and less steep."
"  On the one hand, waiting too long to begin normalization can r isk significan tly overshooting  our inflation objective given the lags in the operation of mone tary policy."
" We hav e to look at what’s happening to labor force particip ation, to parttime employment  for economic reasons, to job openings, to the pace of quits, t o wage inflation, and other in dicators of the state of the labor market."
" I did say when we agreed that labor market slack has d iminished to some extent in the intermeeting period, and, clearl y, over a longer span of time, over the last several years, obviously we’ve made considerab le progress in moving toward our  goal of maximum employment."
" On inflation, again, there has b een some progress, in the sense  energy prices appear to have stabilized."
" Now, inflati on is going to—overall inflation is likely to run at a low level for a substantial period of time."
" The  big declines in energy prices came toward the end of last year and the beginning of this year , and they’re not going to wash o ut of the inflation data until late in this year."
" An d, with respect to core inflation, it has been runni ng under our 2 percent objective, b ut declining import prices have been reducing that pressure."
" I be lieve that as the labor marke t continues to improve and as our confidence in that forecast rise s, at least for me, my confiden ce will also rise that inflation will move back up toward 2 percent."
" I e xpect that to, over time, pu t upward pressure on core inflation."
" First , I wanted to ask you about a c omment that New York Fed President William Dudley made recently that, in retrospect,  the Fed should have raised interest rates more aggre ssively during the 2004–2006 cycle."
" We place high priorit y on being an accountable and tr ansparent central bank, and I think that if you compare the t ransparency of monetary policy d ecisions in the Federal Reserve with other central banks, we are  one of the most transparent ce ntral banks in terms of the information that we provide to t he public in a whole variety of  ways."
"  First question is also referencing som ething that Bill Dudley said re cently, which is to do with the use of the balance sheet in tight ening monetary policy."
" The last paragraph of the Federal Ope n Market Committee statement s ays:  “The Committee currently anticipates that, eve n after employment and inflation  are near mandateconsistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping  the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee view s as normal in the longer run.”  That’s kind of a mouthful."
" Specifically, they said— your colleague Madam Lagarde mentioned specifically the risk— that even though there’s a risk  of slight inflation by doing that, that there was concern that a ra te hike could trigger market vo latility, with fin ancial stability consequences that go well  beyond the U.S. borders."
"Now, that assumes, as you can s ee, that they’re expecting a pic kup in growth in the second half of this year and furth er improvement in labor marke t conditions."
" Your latest economic projections show that  you expect the unemployment rate—or, many officials expect the unemployment ra te—to fall more slowly this year and then to fall, by impli cation, more quickly next year."
 So we are—productiv ity growth has been—is a fact or that affects the pace of improvement in the labor  market.
" Productivity growth h as been extremely slow for the June 17, 2015 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL  Page 14 of 23  last couple of years, and I think, in part, the pace of improve ment in the labor market that we’re projecting reflects th e notion that there’s likely to be some p ickup in the pace of productivity growth."
" Obviously, that’s someth ing that’s quite uncertain, an d it’s conceivable that if productivity growth disappoints— something I hope that we won’t see, because that has very negative implications  for living standards—we could conceivably  see faster improvement in the labor market."
"But, in addition, there are other margins of slack that don’t s how up in the unemployment rate."
" And given that, you know, emp loyer costs and monthly wages are at a pace that’s at a sixy ear high now, what is the risk—o r, how does the risk change that inflation could strengthen qui cker than you’re expecting?"
" So the Committee es timates that the longerrun n ormal level of the unemployment rate is 5.0 to 5.2.  A t 5.5 percent, where we have  an unemployment rate that still exceeds the Committee’s best attempts to estimate what is a nor mal unemployment rate for this economy, and, as I mentioned, the re appear to be unusually larg e elements of slack over and above that in the form of somewha t stilldepressed labor force participation and parttime work June 17, 2015 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL  Page 15 of 23  for economic reasons."
" So I think it ’s fair to say that most me mbers, most participants on the Committee, wouldn’t judge yet—al though some might—that most wou ldn’t judge us to be at, quote, “maximum employment.”  Wage increases are still running a t a low level, but there have  been some tentative signs that wage growth is picking up."
 W e have seen an increase in th e growth rate of the employment cost index and a mild uptick in t he growth of average hourly ea rnings.
 I would call these tentative signs of stronger wag e growth.
"Still, however, inflation—not onl y headline, but, stripping out  food and energy underlying inflation, core inflat ion—is still running below the  Committee’s objective."
" So I think we need to see additional strength in the labor market and the economy moving somewhat closer to capacity—the output gap shrin king—in order to have confidenc e that inflation will move back up to 2 percent, but we have made some progress."
" How comfo rtable are you with this, and does it impact monetary policy?"
" Anyone who doesn’t have a pristine credit rating is—finds it ve ry difficult at th is point to qualify for a mortgage, and I think we’re  seeing quite a bit of relucta nce, given the job market and given what the history of what’s  happened to house prices, of young p eople to want to buy homes."
" So the demand for multifamily housing to rent is very high, and rent prices are m oving up, I think, because of that."
"economy, and could it influence in anywhere—in any way, sorry, when you will decide t o increase the interest rates?"
" And obviously there are benefits from a strong economy to every household in the e conomy, including savers, fr om having a better job market and a more secure economy."
" I can’t give an i ronclad promise, but I think it ’s clear from our Summary of Economic Projections t hat we anticipate that the eco nomy will grow, that the labor market will improve, that inflation will move back up to 2 perc ent as we—is our objective over the medium term."
"With respect to market reactions , we always, in evaluating the economic outlook, have to take account of financial conditi ons, whether it’s the level of  longterm interest rates or the value of the dollar in assessing the economic outlook."
" And, overall, how important is the dollar exchange  rate in monetary policy these days relative to the past?"
" In addition, import pri ces for nonoil imports contin ue to fall, and I thi nk that’s serving to push down core inflation a littl e bit."
