" Moreover, even after the initial increase in t he target funds rate, our policy  is likely to remain highly accommodative to support continued progress toward our objectiv es of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation."
We have seen continued progress toward our objective of maximum  employment.
" The pace of employment growth has remained strong, with job gains a veraging nearly 290,000 per month over the past three months."
 The unemployment rate was 5.
 Broader measures of job market conditions—such as those countin g individuals who want and are available to work but have not actively searched recently a nd people who are working part time but would rather work full time—have shown similar improve ment.
" Me anwhile, the labor force participation rate—the percenta ge of workingage Americans eith er working or seeking work—is lower than most estimates of  its trend, and wage growth rema ins sluggish, suggesting that some cyclical weakness persists ."
We continue to expect sufficien t underlying strength in economi c growth to support ongoing improvement in the labor m arket.
" After averaging about  2½ percent over 2014, growth of real gross domestic product a ppears to have slowed in the fi rst quarter of this year, in part reflecting a moderation in hous ehold spending."
" In addition, th e recovery in the housing sector remains subdued, and export growth looks to have weakened."
" Loo king ahead, however, the Committee continues to expect a moderate pace of GDP growth, wi th robust job gains and lower energy prices supporting household spending."
"Inflation has declined further  below our longerrun objective, largely reflecting the lower energy prices I just mentioned."
" D eclining import prices have a lso restrained inflation, and in light of the recent appreciation of  the dollar, will likely con tinue to do so in the months ahead."
" My colleagues and I continue to e xpect that as the effects of t hese transitory factors dissipate and as the labor market improves fu rther, inflation will move gradu ally back toward our 2 percent objective over the medium term."
" In making this forecast, we ar e attentive to the low levels of marketbased measures of inflation compensation."
" In contrast, surveybased measures of longerterm inflation expectations have r emained stable."
 The Committe e will continue to monitor inflation developments carefully.
" As always , each participant’s projections March 18, 2015 Chair Yellen’s P ress Conference FINAL  Page 3 of 22  are conditioned on his or her own view of appropriate monetary policy."
 The unemployment rate projections over the next few y ears and in the longer run are g enerally a bit lower than the December projections.
" At the end of this year, the central ten dency for the unemployment rate stands at 5 to 5.2 percent, in line with participants’ estimate s of the longerrun normal unemployment rate."
 Committee participants generally see the un employment rate declining a little further ove r the course of 2016 and 2017.
" For economic growth, participan ts generally reduced their projections since December, with many citing a we aker outlook for net exports."
" Nonetheless, the central tende ncy of the growth projections for  this year and next, at 2.3 to 2.7 percent, remains somewhat above  estimates of the longerrun nor mal growth rate."
" The central ten dency of the inflation projectio ns for this year is now below 1 percent, down noticeably since Dec ember."
" As the transitory fac tors holding down inflation abate, the central tendenc y rebounds to 1.7 to 1.9 percent next  year and rises to 1.9 to 2 percent in 2017."
" In Decembe r and January, the Committee judged that it could be patient  in beginning to normalize the s tance of monetary policy."
" As we noted in our statement, the decision to raise the target range will depend on our assessmen t of realized and expected progress toward our objectives of  maximum employment and 2 perc ent inflation."
" We continue to base that assessment on a wid e range of information, includi ng measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflati on pressures and inflation exp ectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
 W e anticipate that it will be appropriate to raise  the target range for the federal funds rate when the Committee has seen further improvement in the labor market and is reasonably confident that  inflation will move back to it s 2 percent objective over the medium term.
"Once we begin to remove policy acc ommodation, we continue to ex pect that—in the words of our statement—“even after employment and inflation are  near mandateconsistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping  the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee view s as normal in the longer run.” This guidance is consistent with t he paths for appropriate poli cy reported by FOMC participants."
" Compared with the  projections made in December, most participants lowered their path for the federal funds rat e, consistent with the downward r evisions made to the projections for GDP growth and inflation as well  as somewhat lower estimate s of the longerrun normal unemployment rate."
" The me dian projected rate in 2017 remains below the 3¾ percent or so projec ted by most participants as th e rate’s longerrun value, even though the central tendency of the unemployment rate by that ti me is slightly below that of its estimated longerrun value, and the  central tendency for inflat ion is close to our 2 percent objective."
" I would like to emphasize that these forecasts of t he appropriate path of the federal funds rate are conditional on par ticipants’ individual projecti ons for economic output, inflation, and other factors."
" Accordingly, if the expansion proves to be mor e vigorous than currently anti cipated and inflation moves higher than expected, then the a ppropriate path would likely fo llow a steeper and higher trajectory; conversely, if conditi ons were to prove weaker, the n the appropriate  trajectory would be lower and less steep."
 So there’s been this pretty consistent ref erence to expectations of abovetrend growth over the last few months.
" Now we’re seeing growt h downgraded in the context of v ery explicit references to international and external c onditions:  weak export growth, oil  dragging down inflation, and your March 18, 2015 Chair Yellen’s P ress Conference FINAL  Page 6 of 22  own comments now on the dollar."
" Well, it looks like, from incoming data pertaini ng to the first quarter, that real GDP growth has decline d somewhat below where it was f or the last several quarters of last year."
 And that’s really why t he Committee indicated that growth has moderated somewhat.
 There has been a slight downgrad ing of estimates of growth for this year.
" The strength of the dolla r is also one factor that, a s I noted, is holding down import prices and, at least on a transit ory basis at this point, pushi ng inflation down."
" So, we are taking account of international developm ents, including prospects for growth in our trade partners, in making the forecast we have here."
" The po licy statement today talks about one of the prere quisites you’ll need to start  raising rates is to be “reasonably March 18, 2015 Chair Yellen’s P ress Conference FINAL  Page 7 of 22  confident” that inflation—your i nflation target—will be met at 2 percent, but that is coming out at a time when you’ve lowere d your forecast on inflation, what— which I would think would make you less confident about it ."
 What is it go ing to take to make you “reasonably confident” about inflation?
" And a stronger labor market wit h less labor market slack is one  factor that would tend to, certainly for me, increase my con fidence that as slack diminish es, that inflation will move up over time."
" Other things I will be looking at—of course, the in flation data, but as we said, we expect inflation to remain quite low because of the depressing influence of energy price declines and the dollar."
" But we will be looking at the inflation data c arefully to see if w e can interpret, for example, low levels of inflati on—if we see that, which we expec t, as reflecting those influences."
 We will be looking at wage growth.
" We may not see wage growth pick up, I woul dn’t say either that that is  a precondition to raising rates."
" But if we did see wage growth pi ck up, that would be at least a  symptom that inflation would likely move up over time."
We’ll be watching inflation expe ctations.
 And ma rketbased measures of inflation compensation have fallen.
" Chair Yellen, the famous dot plot that we always ta lk about showed that officials ’ expectations for where interest rates are going to end the y ear in 2015, ’16, and ’17 have come  down fairly notably."
" For one thi ng, you do see meaningful downward  adjustment in the inflation forecast, certainly for this year."
" So that range has mov ed down noticeably from—previously it was 5.2 to 5.5, and i t’s now moved down to 5.0 to  5.2.  And downward revisions to the longerrun normal unemployment rate in a way suggests that participants are seeing more slack in the economy now than the y previously did."
" If there are adverse shocks to demand that tend to push infla tion and econom ic performance in an adverse direction, it’s not possible to l ower rates."
" I don’t hear, Chair Yelle n, any quantitative measures of what increasing conf idence is in inflation or headi ng back towards—or a further improvement in the job market, which is unusual for a Fed that not too long ago was providing us metrics on unemployment about when it would move with rates."
 And is it thoug ht that you’d have better poli cy and economic outcomes from less certainty about the path of  interest rates?
" So, in terms of cer tainty and providing metrics,  we provided a metric or a threshold of 6½ percent severa l years ago and told market participants and the public that we wouldn’t consider it appropriate  to raise rates as long as the unemployment rate was higher than that level, as long as inflati on was well contained."
" We need to see, as we have said, we want to see fu rther improvement in the labo r market, and we want to feel reasonably confident that the economy is on a trajectory where we will achieve our 2 percent inflation objective."
" There seems to be an awful lot riding on surveys of i nflation expectations, yet thos e surveys are an imprecise instrument; they don’t seem partic ularly sensiti ve to the types  of changes in inflation that we have seen in recent years, they don’t seem to differentiate bet ween, say, 1.5 and 2—the expectations remain stable ev en through those changes."
" Could y ou talk a little bit about why the FOMC has confidence that those me asures are accurate reflection s of where inflation is likely to go and whether, you know, the concerns  that you’ve articulated about marketbased measures at all correspond to concerns that  you may have about surveybased  measures?"
" And  the mean—often the mean or even the median of those measures does not line up very well with actual inflation, so they seem to be biased."
" Nev ertheless, they do seem to be us eful in predicting actual movements in inflation."
" And because we think inflation expecta tions are a determinant of price setting, we need to be looking at the best data that we can, ev en if it’s imperfect, in trying to gauge inflation expectations."
"Now, the fact that survey measur es are stable, even if they are  stable at levels consistent with inflation objectives that a central bank wants to achieve,  that’s not a guarantee that inflation March 18, 2015 Chair Yellen’s P ress Conference FINAL  Page 12 of 22  will, over time, move to be consis tent with those expectations."
"  An example is Japan, I would give you, where for many years th e households and businesses ex pected positive inflation but there was a consistent undershoot ."
" And I wanted to refer to your most recent Monetary Policy Report to Congress last month, in which you said “overall equity valuations by some conventional measures are somewhat hi gher than their historical levels ."
" And in addition to looking at asset valuations, w e also look at measures of cre dit growth, of the extent of leverage being used in the econom y and in the financial sector,  and the extent of maturity transformation."
"With respect to congressional cha nges that are under considerat ion that would politicize monetary policy by bring ing Congress in to make policy judgment s about, in realtime, on our monetary policy decisions."
" C ongress itself decided in 1978 tha t that was a bad t hing to do, that it would lead to poor economic perfor mance, and they carved out th is one area of policy reviews, March 18, 2015 Chair Yellen’s P ress Conference FINAL  Page 14 of 22  of monetary policy decisionmaking, from GAO audits."
 The global experience shows th at giving central banks independe nce to make monetary policy decisions that th ey think are in the be st interest of th e country and consistent with their mandates leads to lower inflation and more stable macroeconomic  outcomes.
" Of co urse, we’re ready to provide information that Congress needs t o evaluate the Fed’s decisionm aking, in monetary policy and elsewhere."
"With respect to monetary policy rules, they can be useful, and I find them useful—and long have—as a kind of benchmark f or thinking about what might be the appropriate stance of policy."
" But, remember, we hav e to put that in context:  There are a lot of things that affect t he U.S. outlook, and while that is  serving as a drag on economic growth, overall the Committee continues to see sufficient stren gth—particularly in private spending—that we are expecti ng abovetrend growth, even so."
" Many, many studies over decades and decades have showed that there are lags in the way monetary pol icy affects the economy, and, therefore, monetary policy does  have to be forward looking."
" In spite of the fact that t hey are projecting tha t inflation will be low, they’re looking forwar d and they see that, by the end o f 2016 or 2017, with the labor market recovering, and assuming tha t inflation expectations rem ain stable and transitory influences no longer affecting inflation, they see inflation he ading back to our 2 percent objective."
" We said we would do that when econom ic conditions were appropriate  after we begin raising rates, because we want changes in the—our target range for the federal  funds rate to be the main tool by which we shift the stance of monetary policy."
" Some people have sugg ested that you might need to manage those runoffs  a little more granularly, if  that’s a word, perhaps pursue a different track for Treasur ies versus MBS or, you know, at give n quarters when you have very large amounts maturing, and there  might be a spike in longterm  interest rates, that maybe you would vary the rate of runoff."
 A positive aspect of what is fundamentally a disappointment is th at the labor market has improved more rapidly than might have been expected given the pace of ec onomic growth.
" So the unemployment rate has come down m ore rapidly than I would have expected, and the labor market has improved more rapidly than I would have expected."
" I would expect  it to pick up, and as you can see from the longerrun growth projections, most FOMC participants believe it will pick up above current levels."
" When you decide to start raising interest rates, could that decision ha ppen at a meeting in which you—it’ s not followed by a press conference?"
