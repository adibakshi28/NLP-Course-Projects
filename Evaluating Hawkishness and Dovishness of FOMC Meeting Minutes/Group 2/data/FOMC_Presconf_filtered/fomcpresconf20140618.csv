 The Committee maintained its forward guidance regarding the federal funds rate target and reaffirmed its view  that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy remains appropriate.
 Today’s policy actions reflect the Committee’s assessment that the economy is continuing to make progress toward our objectives of maximum employment and price stability.
" The unemployment rate, at 6.3 percent, is fourtenths lower than at the time of our March meeting, and the broader U -6 measure— which includes marginally attached workers and those working part time but prefer ring full -time work —has fallen by a similar amount."
" Even given these declines, however, unemployment remains elevated, and a broader assessment of indicators suggests that underutilization in the labor market remains significant."
" Private domestic final demand —that is, spending by domestic households and businesses —continued to expand in the first quarter, and the limited set of indicators  of spending and production in the second quarter have picked up."
 The Committee thus believes that economic activity is rebounding in the current quarter and will continue to expand at a moderate pace thereafter.
" Inflation has continued to run below the Committee’s 2 percent objective, and the Committee remains mindful that inflation running persistently below its obje ctive could pose June 18, 2014  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 2 of 21   risks to economic performance."
" Given that longer -term inflation expectations appear to be well anchored, and in light of the ongoing recovery in the United States and in many economies around the world, the Committee continues to expect i nflation to move gradually back toward its objective."
 The Committee will continue to assess incoming data carefully to ensure that policy is consistent with attaining the FOMC’s longer -run objectives of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent.
" As always, each participant’s projections are conditioned on his or her own views of appropriate monetary policy."
 The central  tendency of the unemployment rate projections is slightly lower than in the March projections and now stands at 6.0 to 6.1 percent at the end of this year.
" From there, Committee participants generally see the unemployment rate declining to its longer -run normal level by the end of 2016."
" The central tendency of the projections for real GDP growth is 2.1 to 2.3 percent for 2014, down notably from the March projections, largely because of the unexpected contraction in the first quarter."
" Over the next two y ears, the projections for real GDP growth remain somewhat above the estimates of longer -run normal growth."
" Finally, FOMC participants continue to see inflation moving only gradually back toward 2 percent over time as the economy expands."
" The central tendency of the inflation projections is 1.5 to 1.7 percent in 2014, rising to 1.6 to 2 percent  in 2016."
" These sizable and still -increasing holdings will continue to put downward pressure on long erterm interest rates, support mortgage markets, and make financial conditions more accommodative, helping to support job creation and a return of inflation to the Committee’s objective."
" If incoming information broadly supports the Committee’s expectation of ongoing improvement in labor markets and inflation moving back over time toward its longer -run objective, the Committee will likely continue to reduce the pace of asset purchases in  measured steps at future meetings."
" However, as I have emphasized before, purchases are not on a preset course, and the Committee’s decisions about the pace of purchases  remain contingent on its outlook for  jobs and inflation as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases."
 Let me now turn to the framework we will be applying as we consider interest rate policy.
" In determining how long to mai ntain the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess progress —both realized and expected —toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation."
" This broad assessment will not hinge on any one or  two indicators, but will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments."
" Based on its current assessment of these factors, the Committee anticipates that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate, for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends, June 18, 2014  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 4 of 21   especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee’s 2 percent longer -run goal, and longer -term inflation expectations remain well anchored."
" Further, once we begin to remove policy accommodation, it ’s the Committee’s current assessment that, even after employment and inflation are nea r mandateconsistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run."
" These include restrained household spending, reduced credit availability, and diminished expectations for future growth in output and incomes, consistent with t he view that the potential growth rate of the economy may be lower for so me time."
" If the economy proves to be stronger than anticipated by the Committee, resulting in a more rapid convergence of employment and inflation to the FOMC’s objectives, then increases in the federal funds rate target are likely to occur sooner and to be more rapid than currently envisaged."
" June 18, 2014  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 5 of 21   Before taking you r questions, I’d like to provide an update on the Committee’s ongoing discussions on the mechanics of normalizing the stance and conduct of monetary policy."
" To be clear, these discussions are in no way intended to signal any imminent change in the stance of monetary policy."
" The Committee is co nfident that it has the tools it needs to raise shortterm interest rates when it becomes appropriate to do so and to control the level of short -term interest rates thereafter, even though the Federal Reserve will continue to have a very large balance sheet for some time."
" The Committee’s recent discussions have centered on the appropriate mix of tools to employ during the normalization process and the associated implications for the degree of control over short -term interest rates, the functioning of the f ederal funds market, and the extent to which the Federal Reserve transacts with financial institutions outside the banking sector."
" There is every reason to expect, Madam Chair, that the PCE inflation rate, which is followed by the Fed, looks likely to exceed your 2016 consensus forecast next week ."
 Does this suggest that the Federal Reserve is behind the curve on inflation?
 And what tolerance is there for higher inflation at the Federal Reserve?
" And if it’ s above the 2 percent target, then how is that not kind of blowing through a target the same way June 18, 2014  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 6 of 21   you blew through the 6½ percent unemployment target in that they become these soft targets?"
" I think it’ s important to remember that, broadly speaking, inflation is evolving in line with the C ommittee ’s expectati ons."
" The C ommittee, it h as expected a gradual return in inflation toward its 2 percent objective."
" And I think the recent evidence we have seen, abstracting from the noise, suggests that we are moving back gradually over time toward our 2 percent objectiv e, and I see things roughly in line with where we expected inflation to be."
" I think if you look at the SEP projections that were submitted this time, you see very little change in inflation projections of the C ommittee ."
 What about the tolerance for higher inflation?
" Well, the C ommittee has emphasized that we have  the 2  percent objective  for, as a longer -term matter , for PCE inflation and we would not willingly see a prolonged period in which inflation persistently runs below our objective or above our objective , and that remains true."
" Madam Chair, could you comment a little bit more on the decline in the long -run interest rate projection?"
" And I think, you know, the most likely reason for that is there has been some slight decline, as I mentioned in my opening statement, of projec tions pertaining to longer -term growth, and typically estimates of the longer -run normal federal funds rate or short -term interest rates would move in  line with growth projections."
" My question is sort of the f lip side of Steve’ s, and it’ s about your outlook for unemployment."
" Your predecessor has said that the Fed has been consistently too pessimistic about the level of the unemployment rate, and today, you guys lowered your outlook again."
 Can you tell me a little bit more about how you see the unemployment rate evolving to meet your forecast?
" So, it’ s true that unemploym ent has declined by more than the Committee expected and you do see a small downward revision in the C ommittee ’s projections, at least the central tendency for the unemployment rate."
  We have seen continued job growth at a pace that is certainly sufficient to be diminishing labor market slack over time.
"  Over the last three months , for example, employment—payroll employment —has been rising around 230,000 jobs June 18, 2014  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 8 of 21   per month and we ’re running close to 200,000 over the last year."
" So, it’ s in no way surprising to see a  decline in the unemployment rate."
" That said, many of my colleagues and I would see a portion of the decline in the unemployment rate as perha ps not representing a diminution of slack in the labor market."
"  And while I think most of us would agree that there has been and will continue to be secular decline in the labor force participation rate  for demographic reasons, I think a portion of the decline we’ve seen in the unemployment rate probably reflects a kind of shadow unemployment or discouragement, a cyclical part of labor force participation."
"  Now, if that ’s correct, we may see that as the economy picks up steam and we see further recovery in the labor market, that those, let ’s call them discouraged workers, will return either to unemployment or to employment."
"  And as labor force participation begins to stabilize, the unemployment rate will come down less quickly."
" You asked about implications for the path of policy and I would just say, the guidance that we ’ve given, our forward guidance , states that the timing of liftof f will depend on actual progress we see and the progress we expect to see going forward in terms of achieving both of our goals, namely maximum employment and our 2 percent inflation objective."
" So, we ’re not going to look at any single indicator like the unemployment rate to assess how we ’re doing on meeting our employment goal ; we will look at a broad range of indicators."
" That said, as I tried  to emphasize in my opening statement, there is uncertainty about monetary policy."
" The appropriate path of policy, the timing in pace of interest rate increases, ought to and I believe will respond to unfolding economic developments."
" If we don ’t see the improvement that ’s projected in the baseline outlook, that the June 18, 2014  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 9 of 21   opposite would be true and the pace of the timing and pace of interest rate increases would be later and more gradual."
" Risk premiums are very low, and in particular, the market expectations for interest rates, for short -term interest rates look below even the Fed’s own projections as laid out in your dot plot."
" But I guess I would say, it is important , as I emphasized in my opening statement , for market participants to recognize that there is uncertainty about what the path of interest rate s—short -term rates —will be."
" You asked me about the dot plot —our forecast , or our projections , for the f ed funds rate —and you do see a range of disagreement among the participants there , so by the time you get t o 2016, there is a considerable range of opinion, and I think, in part, that reflects the uncertainty that I’m talking about —that participants do see different pace of recovery, different trajectories for inflation, and it’ s appropriate for them to adjust their thinking about what the path of policy should be to their own view of how the economy will evolve over time."
 You ’ve spoken about the sense that the recession has done permanent damage to the economic output and you’ve reduced gradually over time your forecast of long -term growth .
 Are we stuck with slower growth?
" Well , I think pa rt of the reason that we are seeing slower growth  in potential output may reflect the fact that capital investment has been very weak during the downturn in the long recovery that we ’re experiencing."
"  So, a diminished contribution from capital formation to  growth does make a negative contribution to growth."
" And there is the fear that those individuals find it harder to gain employment , that their attachment to June 18, 2014  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 11 of 21   the labor force may diminish over time and the networ ks of contacts that are —they have that are helpful in gaining employment can begin to erode over time."
" So it probably isn ’t because, you know, unemployment’s declining."
" Chair Yellen, the Fed has slashed its growth projections for this year , and you’ve gone to pains to explain that there is uncertainty in the path of interest rates in the economy , and yet the Fed central tendency projections for 2015 and 2016 remain quite strong."
 Are you confident that the U.S. economy has entered a period of sustained above -trend economic growth?
" Well, when you say “ confident,”  I suppos e the answer is “ no” because there is uncertainty, but I think there are many good reasons why we should see a period of sustained growth in excess of the economy ’s potential."
" We have a highly accommodative June 18, 2014  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 13 of 21   monetary policy."
" We have households who are becoming more comfortable with their debt levels and more able to service that debt, an improving job market."
  So I think all of those things ought to be working to produce above -trend growth and I think that ’s what ’s reflected in the forecast.
" Y ou know, nevertheless, the labor market has continued to improve, and over a number of years in which, admittedly , growth has come in at a disappointing level, we ’ve still seen the labor market broadly improve , and I expect that to continue."
 How would the C ommittee respond if inflation did temporarily move above target in the near term before you achieve full employment?
" Your colleague John Williams and the IMF have both suggested that the C ommittee might consider allowing inflation to temporarily overshoot because that might achieve a faster, larger improve ment  in employment."
 Second question is:  Will financial stability  considerations play a role in when and how fast the Committee normalizes interest rates?
" So with respect to the question of overshooting, let me start by saying that inflation continues to run well below our objective, and we ’re still some  ways away from maximum employment."
" They both call for the same policy —namely , a highly accommodative monetary policy."
" So, at best, overshooting of inflation or the  thought that we will reach our inflation objective before we have attained maximum employment, I suppose I would see , at most , as a risk that we could face somewhere down the road."
" Symmetrically, it’ s also conceivably a risk that we would reach our maxim um employment objective before we ’ve actually attained our inflation objective."
" And what that statement said is that, first of all, whenever either inflation or employment are away from their preferred or mandate -consistent l evels, it will always be the FOMC ’s policy to make sure that we get back to those target levels over the medium term."
" You ’ve told people , don’ t pay any attention to the dot plot, and your two mandates, inflation and unemployment, are backwardlooking lagging indicators."
" That ’s one of the reasons I mentioned that this environment of low volatility is very much on my radar screen and would be a conce rn to me if it prompted an increase in leverage or other kinds of risktaking behavior that could unwind in a sharp way and provoke a sharp, for example, jump in interest rates."
"  But broadly speaking, if the question is , to what extent is monetary policy , at this time , being driven by financial stability concerns , I would say that —well, I would never take off the table that monetary policy should—could, in some circumstances , respond."
 I don ’t see them shaping monetary policy in an important way right now.
" I don’ t see a broad -based increase in leverage, rapid increase in credit growth or maturity transformation, the kinds of broad tr ends that would suggest to me that the level of financial stability risks has risen above a moderate level."
" You expressed a lot of pessimism about emerging markets, and I see it more likely that we ’ll see moderate growth and a pickup there."
 I’m wondering:  What ’s the Fed ’s general expect ation for wage growth this year and next year?
" And if inflation outpaces wage growth, does that scenario make you more hesitant to raise the federal funds rate next year?"
"  Or if, conversely, wages rise just enough to keep up with inflation, they ’re moving in lockstep, let ’s say, is that enough to satisfy what you’re looking for in the  job market?"
" You know, I see compensation growth, broadly speaking , as having been very well contained."
"  By most  measures, compensation growth is running around 2 percent."
" So that ’s real wage growth or real compensation growth that ’s essentially flat rather than rising, and real wage growth really has June 18, 2014  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 20 of 21   not been rising in line with productivity."
" My own expectation i s that as the labor market begins to tighten, we will see wage growth pick up some to the point where real wage growth, where compensation or nominal wages are rising more rapidly than inflation, so households are getting a real increase in their take -home  pay."
" Within limits, it’ s not a threat to inflation because consistent with the level of inflation we have for our 2 percent inflation objective, we could see wages growing at a more rapid rate and—a somewhat more rapid rate—a nd, indeed, that would be part of my forecast of what we would see as the labor market picks up."
 So I think part of my confidence in  the fact that we ’ll see a pickup in growth relates to the fact that I think consumer spending will continue to grow at a healthy rate.
" And , in part, that ’s premised on some pickup in the rate of wage growth so that it’ s rising greater —more than inflation."
" The C ommittee said June 18, 2014  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 21 of 21   very clearly in their s tatement that what they would be looking at and deciding on the timing of interest rate increases would be the progress we ’re making in achieving our objectives, how far we are from achieving our labor market objective and our inflation objective , and that  we will be assessing that progress, and that ’s the key determinant of when interest rate increases are likely to come."
