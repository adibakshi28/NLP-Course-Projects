 My colleagues and I are strongly committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal .
"Today the FOMC raised its policy interest rate by ¾ percentage point, and we anticipate that ongoing increases w ill be appropriate ."
 We are moving our policy stance purposefully to a level that will be sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent.
 I will have more to say about today’ s monetary policy actions after briefly reviewing economic developments .
"economy has slowed from the historically high growth rates of 2021, which reflected the reopening of the economy following the pandemic recessi on."
 Recent indicators point to modest growth of spending and production.
" Growth in consumer spending has slowed from last year’ s rapid pace, in part reflecting lower real disposable income and tighter financial conditions ."
" Higher interest rates and slower output growth also appear to be weighing on business fixed investment, while weaker economic growth abroad is restraining exports ."
" As shown in our Summary of Economic Projections, since June , FOMC participants have marked down their projections for economic activity, with the median projection for real September 21, 2022   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  Page 2 of 21   GDP growth standing at just 0.2 percent this year and 1.2 percent next year, well below the medi an estimate of the longer -run normal growth rate ."
"Despite the slowdown in growth, the labor market has remained extremely tight, with the unemployment rate near a 50year low, job vacancies near historical highs, and wage growth elevated ."
" Job gains have been robust, with employment rising by an average of 378,000 jobs per month over the last three months ."
" The labor market continues to be out of balance, with demand for workers substantially exceeding the supply of available workers ."
" FOMC participants expect supply and demand conditions in the labor market to come into better balance over time, easing the upward pressure on wages and prices ."
" The median projection in the SEP for the unemployment rate rises to 4.4 percent at the end of next year, ½ percentage point higher than in the June projections ."
" Over the next three years, the median unemployment rate runs above the median estimate of its longer -run normal level."
 Inflation remains well above our 2 percent longerrun goal .
" Although gasoline prices have turned down in recent months, they remain well above year -earlier levels, in part reflecting Russia ’s war against  Ukraine, which has boosted prices for energy and food and has created additional upward pressure on inflation."
 P articipants continue to see risks to inflation as weighted to the upside .
"September 21, 2022   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  Page 3 of 21   Despite elevated inflation, longerterm inflation expectations appear t o remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters as well as measures from financial markets."
" But that is not grounds for complacency; the longer the current bout of high inflation continues, the greater the chance that expectations of higher inflation will become entrenched."
 The Fed ’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people .
" My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship , as it erodes purchasing power, especially for  those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation."
" We are highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to b oth sides of our mandate, and we are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective ."
" And we are continuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet, which plays an important role in firming the stance of monetary policy."
" Over coming months, we will be looking for compelling evidence that inflation is moving  down consistent with inflation returning to 2 percent ."
" With today’ s action, we have raised interest rates by 3 percentage points this year ."
" At some point, as the stance of monetary policy tightens further, it will become appropriate to slow the pace of increases while we assess how our c umulative policy adjustments are affecting the economy and September 21, 2022   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  Page 4 of 21   inflation ."
 We are taking forceful and rapid steps to moderate demand so that it comes into better alignment with supply .
 Our overarching focus is usi ng our tools to bring inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keep longer -term inflation expectations well anchored .
" Reducing inflation is likely to require a sustained period of below -trend growth, and there will very likely be some softening of  labor market conditions ."
 Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run .
 We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum -employment and price -stability goals .
" So the way we ’re thinking about this is , the overarching focus of the Committee is getting inflation back down to 2 percent ."
" To accomplish that, we think we ’ll need to do two things , in particular:  to achieve a period of growth below trend;  and also some softening in labor market conditions to foster a better balance between demand and supply in  the labor market."
"  So on the first, the Committee ’s forecast s and those of most outside forecasters do show growth running below its longer -run potential this year and next year ."
" And in light of the high inflation we ’re seeing, we think we ’ll need to—and in light of w hat I just said, we think that we ’ll need to bring our funds rate to a restrictive level and to keep it there for some  time ."
" First, we ’ll want to see growth c ontinuing to run below trend, we ’ll want to see movements in the labor market showing a return to a better balance between supply and demand, and, ultimately , we’ll want to see clear evidence that inflation is moving back down to 2 percent ."
" In terms of reducing rates, I think we ’d want to be very confident that inflation is moving back down to 2 percent before we would consider that ."
 Can you talk about how you factor in the variable lags on inflation and the extent to which the outlook for rates should be seen as linear in the sense that you keep raising rates ?
" So, of course , monetary policy does , famously , work with long and variable lags ."
" Then , changes in financial conditions begin to affect economic activity fairly quickly, within a few months ."
 But it’ s likely to take some time to see the full effects of changing financial conditions on inflation.
" And that ’s why I noted in my opening remarks that , at some point, as the stance of poli cy tightens further, it will become appropriate to slow the pace of rate hikes while we assess how our cumulative policy adjustments are affecting the economy and inflation ."
" As I mentioned, what we think we need to do and should do is to move our policy rate to a restrictive level that’ s restrictive enough to bring inflation down to 2 percent, where we have confidence of that ."
" The projections show the unemployment rate rising to 4.4 percent next year, and, historically , that kind of rise in the unemployment rate would typically bring a recession with it ."
" Should we interpret that to mean no soft landing, and is that kind of rise necessary to get inflation down?"
" So you’ re right—in the SEP, there ’s what I would characterize as a relatively modest increase in the unemployment rate from a historical perspective, given the expected decline in inflation."
" It’ s plausible, I’ll say , that job openi ngs could come down significantly—and they need to—without as much of an increase in unemployment as has happened in earlier historical episodes ."
" In addition, in this cycle, longer -run inflation expectations have generally been fairly  well anchored, and , as I ’ve said, there ’s no basis for complacency there."
" And I guess the third thing I would point to that ’s different this time is that part of this inflation is caused by this series of supply shocks that we ’ve had, beginning with the pandemic , and, really , with the reopening of  the economy, and more recently amplified and added to by Russia ’s invasion of Ukraine —have all contributed to the sharp increase in inflation ."
"  Those developments, if sustained, could help ease the pressures on inflation."
" We have always understood that restoring price stability while achieving a relatively modest decline —or, rather , increase—in unemployment and a soft l anding would be very challenging."
" That ’s going to depend on how quickly wage and price inflation pressures come down, whether  expectations remain anchored, and whether , also, do we get more labor supply, which would help as well ."
" No netheless, we’ re committed to getting inflation back down to 2 percent —because we think that a failure to restore price stability would mean far greater pain later on ."
" That and quits are really very good ways to look at how tight the labor market is and how different it is from other cycles, where , generally , the unemployment rate itself is the single best indicator ."
" I f inflation doesn ’t perform as you expect, do you want to have a  policy rate that ’s above the underlying inflation rate, for example, and do you have an estimate for where you think the underlying inflation rate might be in the economy right now ?"
" Well , so, again, we believe that we need to raise our poli cy stance overall to a level that is restrictive—a nd by that I mean, is meaningfully, putting meaningful downward pressure on inflation."
" We also September 21, 2022   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  Page 10 of 21   know that there are long and variable lags, particularly as they relate to inflation ."
" And I think that would be the case if you look at the numbers that we ’re writing down and think about —you measure those against some sort of forward -looking assessment of inflation, inflation expectations ."
  Is it lack of progress on inflation seen in the CPI reports?
 Or is it a motivation to get as much d one while the job market is still as strong as it is?
" So, what we ’ve seen is, inflation has —our expectation has been that we would begin to see inflation come down, l argely because of supplyside healing ."
" We have seen some supply -side healing, but inflation has not really come down."
" If you look at core PCE inflation, which is a good measure of where inflation is running now, if you look at it on a 3- , 6-, and 12month trailing annualized basis, you’ ll see that inflation is at 4.8 percent, 4.5 percent, and 4.8 percent ."
So that ’s a pretty  good summary of where we are with inflation .
" Chair Powell, how should we interpret the fact that core inflation is still not forecast in the SEP to be back to target in 2025, and yet the dot plot projects cuts as early as 2024?"
 And does that mean there ’s a level of inflation above the 2 percent target that the Fed is willing  to tolerate?
" Just as a quick follow -up:  I mean , if the concern is that underlying inflation is becoming more entrenched, perhaps , each month, then why forgo the more aggressive 100 basis point increase today, and does that risk having to do more later on?"
"So if you look at them together —and, as I just mentioned, if you really look at this year ’s inflation, 3 -, 6-, and 12month trailing, you see inflation is running too high."
" If that’ s the one thing you know, you know that this Committee is committed to getting to a meaningfully restrictive stance of policy and staying there until we feel confident that inflation is coming down."
" A number of commentators have come to the view, including over at the World Bank, that simultaneous global tightening around the world is, creates a risk of a glo bal recession that ’s worse than is necessary to bring inflation down."
" We are in pretty regular contact, and we exchange, of course —we all serve a domestic mandate, domestic objectives—in our case, the dual mandate, maximum employment  and price stability ."
" I September 21, 2022   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  Page 14 of 21   mean , I can ’t say that we do it perfectly, but it’ s not as if we don ’t think about the policy decisions —monetary policy and otherwise —the economic developments that are taking place in major economies that can have an effect on the U.S ."
So I don’ t see—it’s hard to talk about collaboration in a world where people have very different levels of interest rates .
" Chair Powell, you talked about some ways the higher interest rates are affecting the economy, but we ’ve also seen a resilient labor market with durable consumption, strong corporate profits, and I ’m wondering what your s tory is on the resilience of the economy."
" A fter all, you and your colleagues said, “Well, we started tightening in March when we were talking about interest rates in the future .”  And, indeed, Treasury rates moved up, so we should have had a lot of tighte ning taking e ffect."
" But there are—the secto rs of the economy that are most interest rate sensitive are certainly showing the effects of our tightening , and , of course , the obvious example is housing, September 21, 2022   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  Page 15 of 21   where you see declining activity of all different kinds and house price increases moving down."
" I think, through exchange rates , we’re having an effect on expo rts and imports ."
" There’s still very significant savings out there, although not as much at the lower end of the income spectrum —but still, some savings out there to support growth."
" Now, the data sort of are showing that growth is going to be below trend this year ."
" We ’re forecasting growth well below that, and most forecasters are."
 But you’ re right —there ’s certainly a possibility that growth can be stronger than that .
" But , of course , we are focused on the thing I started with, which is getting inflation back down to 2 percent ."
" In a world of euphemisms that we live in here, with “below -trend growth”  and “ modest increase in unemployment, ” I’m wondering if I can ask you a couple of direct questions for the American people ."
" Do the odds now favor, given whe re September 21, 2022   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  Page 16 of 21   you are and where you’ re going with interest rates, favor a recession ?"
 Four  point  four percent unemployment is about 1.3 million jobs .
" I think that there ’s a very high likelihood that we ’ll have a period of what I ’ve me ntioned is below -trend growth, by which I mean much lower growth, and we ’re seeing that now ."
" So the median forecast , I think , this year among my colleagues and me was 0.2 percent growth."
 So that ’s very slow growth.
" So that ’s a slower, that ’s a very slow level of growth, and it could give rise to increases in unemployment ."
"We’re never going to say that there are too many people working, but the real point is this:  Inflation —what we hear from people when we meet with them is that they really are suffering from inflation ."
" And if we want to set ourselves up, really light the way to another period of a very strong labor market, we have got to get inflation behind us ."
" So, what we need to do is get rates up to the point where we’re putting meaningful downward pressure on inflation, and that ’s what we ’re doing."
" And we certainly don’ t hope, we certainly haven’ t given up the idea that we can have a relatively modest increase in unemployment ."
" But in the short run, there is a lot of concern , as people have been expressing here, about higher unemployment as a result of these rate hikes or as a result of rate hikes ."
" So can you explain, though, what about high inflation now threatens the  job market?"
" I mean, you seem to suggest inflation, high inflation, will eventually lead to a weaker job market ."
" So, for starters, people are seeing the ir wage increases eaten up by inflation ."
" So that ’s what we ’re hearing from people is , you know, very much—that inflation is really hurting ."
So how do we get rid of inflation?
" We have to get supply and demand back into alignment , and the way we do that is by slowing the economy."
" The United States had 2 percent inflation, didn’ t move around much, and that was  enormously beneficial to the public that we serve ."
"  I mean , it really depends on how long it takes for wag es and, more than that, prices to come down for inflation to come down."
 And so what you see in our projections today is that inflation moves down significantly over the course of next year and then more the next year after that.
" And things will start to feel better to people —they ’ll feel lower inflation, they ’ll feel that the economy is improving."
" A nd also, if our projections are close to right, you’ ll see that the costs in unemployment are, they ’re meaningful, and they ’re certainly very meaningful to the people who lose their jobs ."
" We’ve had three  of the four longest in measured September 21, 2022   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  Page 19 of 21   history since we got inflation under control ."
" So when inflation is low and stable, you can have these 9, 10, 11—10year, anyway, expansions , and you can see what we saw in 2018, ’ 19, and ’ 20, which was very low unemployment, the biggest wage gains going to people at the low end of the spectrum, the smallest racial gaps that we ’ve seen since we started keeping track of that ."
" But, to get there , we’re going to have to get supply and demand back in alignment , and that ’s going to take tight monetary policy for a period of time ."
 Is it higher interest rates on credit cards?
" Higher interest rates, slower growth, and a softening labor market are all painful for the public that we serve ."
" But they’ re not as painful as failing to restore price stability and then having to come back and do it down the road again and doing it at a time when , actually , now people have really come to expect high inflation."
" If the concept of high inflation becomes entrenched in  people ’s economic thinking about their decisions, then sort of getting back to price stability —the cost of getting back to price stability just rises, and so we want to avoid that ."
" Existing home sales have fallen for seven months straight, mortgage rates are at their highest level since 2008, yet mortgage demand increased this week , and housing prices are still elevated ."
 So there was a big imbalance between supply and demand.
"For the longer term, what we need is supply and demand to get better aligned so that housing prices go up at a reasonable level —at a reasonable pace—and that people can afford houses again ."
 I think that shelter inflation is going to remain high for some time .
" So I think , on shelter inflation , you’ve just got to assume that it ’s going to remain pretty high for a while ."
" What you’ re going to do is , you’ re going to adjust that for some forward -looking measure of inflation."
" In all cases, you will get forward inflation expectations in the short term , I think, that are going to be, assuming that we ’re doing our jobs appropriately, that will be significant ."
