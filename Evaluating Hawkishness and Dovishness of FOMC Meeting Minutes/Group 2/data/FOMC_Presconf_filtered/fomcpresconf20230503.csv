"From the perspective of  monetary policy, our focus remains squarely on our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people."
" My colleagues and I understand the hardship that high inflation is causing, and we remain strongly committed to bring ing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal."
" Today, the FOMC  raised its policy interest rate by ¼ percentage point."
" Since early last year, we have raised interest rates by a total of 5 percentage points in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time."
" I will May 3, 2023   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 2 of 25  have more to say about today’s monetary policy actions after briefly reviewing economic developments."
" The pace of economic growth in the first quarter of this year continued to be modest, at 1.1 percent, despite a pickup in consumer spending."
 Higher interest rates and slower output growth also appear to be weighing on business fixed investment.
" The unemployment rate remained very low in March, at 3.5 percent."
" Even so, there are some signs that supply and demand in the labor market are coming back into better balance."
" Nominal wage growth has sown —shown some signs of easing, and job vacancies have declined so far this year."
" But overall, labor demand still substantially exceeds the supply of available workers."
Inflation remains well above our longerrun goal of 2 percent.
 Inflation has moderated somewhat since the middle of last year.
" Nonetheless, inflation pressures continue to run high, and the process of getting inflation back down to 2 percent has a long way to go."
" Despite elevated inflation, longerterm inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets."
"The Fed ’s monetary policy actions are guided by, by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people."
" My colleagues and I are acutely aware May 3, 2023   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 3 of 25   that high inflation imposes significant hardship, as it erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation."
" We are high ly attentive to the risks that high inflation pose —poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective."
" With today’ s action, we have raised interest rates by 5 percentage points in a little more than a year."
" We are seeing the effects of our policy tightening on demand in the most interest  rate–sensitive sectors of the economy, particularly housing and investment."
" It will take time, however, for the full effects of monetary restraint to be reali zed, especially on inflation."
" In turn, these tighter credit conditions are likely to weigh on economic activity, hiring, and i nflation."
" In light of these uncertain headwinds, along with the monetary policy restraint we have put in place, our future policy actions will depend on how events unfold."
" In determining the extent to which additional policy firming may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time, the Committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments."
" We , we will make that determination meeting by meeting, based on the totality of May 3, 2023   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 4 of 25   incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation."
 We remain committed to bring ing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keep longer -term inflation expectations well anchored.
 Reducing inflation is likely to require a period of below -trend growth and some softe ning of labor market conditions.
 Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run.
 We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum -employment and price -stability goals.
 I wonder if you could tell us whether we should read the statement today as a suggestion that the Committee is prepared to pause interest rate increases in June.
" And I also wonder if the Fed staff has in any way revised their forecast for a mild recession from the March minutes  and, if so , what a recession like what the y’re envisioning would look and feel like when it comes to, for example, the unemployment rate."
" We took that out , and instead we ’re saying that, in May 3, 2023   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 5 of 25   determining the extent to which additional policy firming may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time, the Committee will take into a ccount certain factors."
" So, broadly, the forecast was for a mild recession, a nd by that I would charact erize as one in which the ris e in unemployment is smaller than is —has been typical in modernera recessions."
Was discussion around the uncertainty of a possible standoff —did that affect today ’s monetary policy decision at all?
 I wouldn’ t say that it was important in today’ s monetary policy decision.
"Can you tell us what the Federal Reserve Board did in the wake of that February presentation May 3, 2023   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 7 of 25   where you were informed that Silicon Valley Bank and other banks were experiencing interest rate risks?"
 And can you tell me what supervisory actions you’ ve done in the wake of the recent bank failures to make sure that banks are currently appropriately managing interest rate risk ?
" And it was about interest rate risk in the banks and, and lots of data."
" I mean, I , I think in this particular case , we have found that the monetary policy tools and the financial stability tools are not in conflict."
" And, at the May 3, 2023   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 8 of 25   same time, we ’ve been able to use our monetary policy tools to foster maximum employment and price stability."
has significant interest rate risk.
" You know, when we—we ’ve been raising interest rates, and that raises the pr ice of credit , and that, in a sense, restricts credit in the economy, working through the price mechanism."
" But I think, conceptually, though, we think that, you know, interest rates —in principle, we won ’t have to raise the rates quite as high as we would have had this not happene d."
" As I say, it does complicate —we, we have, you know, a broad understanding of monetary policy."
 So my question is why it was necessary to raise interest rates today .
"Well, we—the reason is that we —again, with our monetary policy we’re try —trying to reach and then—and then stay at a , for an extended period, a level of policy—a policy stance that ’s sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to 2 percent over time."
" We always have to balance the risk of not doing enough and, and not getting inflation under control against the risk of maybe slowing down economic activity too much."
" You—you know, you can’ t—with , with  economic data, you, you can’t—you’ ve, you’ ve seen —take inflation for a minute."
 We’ ve seen inflation come down—move back up two or three times since March of 2021.
 We’ve seen inflation have a few months of coming down and then come right back up.
" But one way is to look at the  nominal rate and then subtract a , a reasonable estimate of , of, let’s say , oneyear inflation, which might be 3 percent."
" So if the Federal Reserve gets down to the 3 percent inflation, as the projections show , at the end of this year or close to it, would it be okay for you for a prolonged period of 3 percent inflation and hoping for some outside event to move down to 2 percent  target?"
 We’re looking for inflation going down to 2 percent over time.
" But, overall, you’ re near a 50year low in unemployment."
" And, you know, it ’s, it’s a couple  of percentage points above what would be —what would be consistent with 2 percent inflation over time."
" But the labor market  is very, very strong, where as inflation is, you know, running high—well above our —well above our goal."
" And right now , we need to be focusing on bringing inflation down."
" Fortunately, we ’ve been able to do that so far without unemployment going up."
" And the reason is , there ’s just so much excess demand, really, in the labor market."
" It’s, it’s interesting , as, you know, we ’ve raised rates by 5 percentage points in 14 months, and the unemployment rate is 3½ percent,  pretty much where it was —even lower than where it was when we started."
" You know, it wasn’ t supposed to be possible for job openings to decline by as much of the—as they ’ve declined without unemployment going up."
" But it just seems that, to me , that it’ s possible that we can continue to have a cooling in the labor market without having the big increases in unemployment that have gone with many, you know, prior episodes."
" But I do think that it —that this, that the situation in the labor market , with so much excess demand, yet, you know, wages are actually —wages have been moving down."
  The Committee also noted in March that wage growth was still well above levels that would be consistent with 2 percent inflation.
 And then—so you assume wages should be equal to productivity increases plus inflation.
" And so you ca n—you can look at, you know, the employment compensation index, average hourly earnings, the Atlanta w age t racker, compensation per hour —basically , those four and many others."
" And you can—you can look at , at what the —what they would have to run at over a long period of time for that to be consistent with 2 percent inflation."
" Wage increases and closer to 3 percent, roughly, is what it would take to get —to be consistent with inflation over a longer period of time."
" I—by the way, I don’ t want to—I do not think that wages are the principal driver of inflation."
 Those have expanded—did expand sharply during this inflationary period.
" So , speaking of causes of inflation, do you see expanded profit margins as a driver of higher prices?"
" And if so, would you expect them to narrow soon and, and contribute to reduced inflation in the coming months?"
" So higher profits and higher m argins are what happens when you have an imbalance between supply and demand:  too much demand, not enough supply."
" So to get, I , I think—as goods pipelines have , have  gotten, you know, back to normal so that we May 3, 2023   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 18 of 25   don’t have the long waits and the shortages and that kind of thing—I think you will see inflation come dow n."
" And you’ ll see —you’ ll see corporate margins coming down as a result of return of full competition , where there’ s enough supply to meet demand."
" It ’ll be readings on wages, on economic growth, on the labor market, and all of those many things."
"  And, you know, so we can begin to assess how that fits in with monetary policy."
" So we  on the Committee have a —have a view that inflation is going to come down—not so quickly, but it ’ll take some time."
" If you have a different forecast and, you know, markets —or have been, from time to time , pricing in, you know, quite rapid reducti ons in inflation, you know, we ’d, we ’d factor that in."
" And, of course, the history of the last two years has been very much that inflation moves down."
" And, you know, so we think we ’ll have to —demand will have to weaken a little bit, and labor market conditions , conditions may have to soften a bit more to begin to see progress there."
" Is the bar higher now to raise rates at the next meeting, or would a strong jobs report or inflation print be enough to push the F ed to tighten again?"
