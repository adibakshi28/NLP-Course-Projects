"The job market remains strong, the economy continues to expand, and inflation appears to be moving toward the FOMC’s 2 percent longerrun goal."
" As you already know, we decided today to raise the target rate  for the federal funds rate by ¼ percentage point, bringing it to 1½ to  1¾ percent.1  This decision marks another step in the ongoing process of gradually scaling back monetary policy accommodation—a process that has been under way for several years now."
" The unemployment rate remained low in February at 4.1 percent, while the labor force participation rate moved higher."
" That’s a sign of improvement, given that the aging of our population is putting downward pressure on the participation rate, and we expect that the job market will remain strong."
" Although the growth rates of household spending and business investment appear to have moderat ed early this year, gains in the fourth quarter were strong and the fundamentals underpinning demand remain solid."
" Several factors are supporting the outlook:  F iscal policy has become more stimulative, ongoing job gains are boosting incomes and confidence, foreign growth is on a firm trajectory, and overall financial conditions remain accommodative."
" March 21, 2018  Chairman Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 2 of 22  Against this backdrop, inflation remains below our 2 percent longer -run objective."
" The core price index, which excludes the prices of energy and food and is typically a better indicator of futur e inflation, rose 1.5 percent over the same period."
" However, as we have noted for some time, the shortfall of inflation from 2 percent reflects, at least partly, some unusual price declines that occurred nearly a year ago."
" In coming months, as those earl ier declines drop out of the calculation, inflation should move up closer to 2 percent and stabilize around that level over the medium term."
" Of course, various forces will continue to affect inflation."
 Our inflation objective is symmetric in the sense that we are trying to prevent persistent deviations from 2 percent in either direction.
"Based on the projections that Committee participants submitted for this meeting, the median project ion for the growth of inflationadjusted GDP is 2.7 percent this year, 2.4 percent next year, and 2 percent in 2020, a bit above its estimated longer -run rate."
" The median projection for unemployment —for the unemployment rate stands at 3.8 percent in the f ourth quarter of this year and runs at 3.6 percent over the next two years, almost a percentage point below the median estimate of its longer -run normal rate."
" Finally, the median inflation projection is 1.9 percent this year, 2 percent next year, and 2.1 percent in 2020."
" Compared with the projections made in December, real GDP growth is stronger, the unemployment rate is lower, and inflation is slightly higher."
" As I noted earlier, today’s decision to raise the federal funds rate is another step in the process of gradually scaling back monetary policy accommodation as the economic expansion March 21, 2018  Chairman Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 3 of 22  continues."
" In making our policy decisions over the next few years, we will continue to aim for inflation of 2 percent while sustaining the economic expansion and a strong labor market."
" By contrast, raising rates too slowly  would raise the risk that monetary policy would need to tighten abruptly down the road, which could jeopardize the economic expansion."
" At the same time, we want to avoid inflation running persistently below our  objective, which could leave us with less scope to counter an economic downturn in the future."
"Of course, we’ll be watching how the economy evolves in the months and years ahead relative to our maximum employment and p rice stability objectives."
" If the outlook changes, we will adjust monetary policy appropriately."
" As we’ve said, changing the target range for the federal funds rate is our primary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy."
" As always, the Committee would be prepared to use its full range of tools if future economic conditions March 21, 2018  Chairman Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 4 of 22  were to warrant a more accommodative monetary policy than can be achieved solely by reducing the federal funds rate."
"  A higher growth forecast a full point above the long run, lower unemployment seven -tenths  below the long run, a nd yet very little change in inflation."
 What does that say ab out what you and the Committee believe about the inflation dynamic ?
" The Committee ’s estimates of growth went u p, the Committee ’s estimates of unemployment went down, and there was a very slight increase in inflation."
" And I think that reflects, essentially —if you think back to the era after the crisis, unemployment was 10 percent."
 You ’ve only seen very gradual upward pressures on inflation and wages despite that very large increase.
 And that suggests that the relationship between changes in slack and inflation is not so tight.
" So I think when you see those small changes in unemployment, that simply reflects the, you know, the flatness of the Phillips curve, if you will."
" The —on the other side, if we —if we raise rates too quickly, inflation, then, really doesn ’t get sustainably up to 2 percent , and, that will hurt us going forward."
" We need that, and it ’s, you know, we need to make sure that inflation expecta tions are anchored at 2  percent ."
" Chair Powell, I want to ask about the symmetric inflation target—what you outlined in your remarks as preventing persistent deviations."
 I want to understand what symmetry means in the  context of inflation b eing allowed to run above the 2 percent  target now that that ’s part of the projection for—at least for core PCE next year.
"  You know, so as you noted, the —what we ’ve said in the longer -run statement of goals and monetary policy strategy is that we would be concerned with sustained or persistent deviations of inflation either above or below."
" And, I think it ’s—I wouldn’ t characterize what we ’ve done over the last five years as tolerating, you know, an undershoot of inflation."
" It just is that we ’re always going to be seeking 2 percent March 21, 2018  Chairman Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 6 of 22  inflation."
"  You know, we have to balance that against the deviation of employment from —unemployment from its goal."
" Even with the extra fiscal stimulus of the tax cuts, your median growth projection is just up to 2.7 percent, and then—this year —and then drops back down to 2 percent by 2020."
 Is the continued talk in Washington about tax cuts bring ing growth to 3 per cent or higher on a sustained basis overselling their potential impact?
" You know, I would say it ’s hard to say, but it would take —you know, that is well above almost all estimates, current estimates of potential long -run growth."
" It March 21, 2018  Chairman Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 7 of 22  would take, you know, significant increases in productivity and labor force participation to get there."
" So obviously you guys reduced your NAIRU  estimate s slightly  today, but if you continue to see job gains around 200,000 a month, primary labor participation rising slightly, pretty sustainably, you know, moderate wage increases, at what point are you guys going to start to question whether y ou’re actually overshooting full employment?"
 So I guess I ’d start by saying that the natural rate of unemployment is not something that we can observe directly.
" So as the —as the actual unemployment rate has declined  from 10 perce nt to 4.1 percent , the Committee ’s median estimate of the natural rate of unemployment has also declined by a full percentage point."
" As they see unemployment going lower, they ’re loo king at a variety of aspects of the labor market, including wage inflation and price inflation."
" So, as —if inflation —if unemployment does continue to go down, we ’ll continue to do that."
" As I mentioned earlier, there is no —there’ s no sense in the data that we ’re on the cusp of an acceleration of inflation."
" We have seen moderate increases in wages and price inflation, and we seem to be seeing more of that."
" I guess the idea —the theory would be that if you get below the sustainable rate of unemployment for a sustained March 21, 2018  Chairman Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 8 of 22  period, you would see an acceleration of inflation."
" Does that imply that you think now a higher neutral rate of interest is operative in the U.S. economy, and how would you assess the implications for monetary policy?"
" Longer -run values like the neutral rate of interest, the natural rate of unemployment, the potential growth rate of the economy are pinned down by slow -moving forces over time."
" You brought up the fiscal stimulus and the impact it’ s having, and I was curious , how is the change in the federal budget deficit —because the stimulus is coming with great debt —has it changed your approach to how many securities you ’re going to allow to roll off the balance sheet, and is there a level of Treasury supply at which the Fed would consider adjusting its balance sheet roll -off, given how much the U.S. government ’s going to have to borrow going forward?"
"  And, then a second question, things beyond your control —the President  is expected to announce  new tariffs against China, and does  the Committee discuss what potential impacts that could have in regards to inflation ?"
" We announced it, and we said we wouldn’ t change it , really , unless there were a significant downturn that required, you know, meaningful reductions in interest rates."
" We ’re going to use monetary policy as the principle tool of adjusting, you know, our policy."
" Mr. Chairman, a quick follow on the trade question, and then a productivity question."
" And then, the second question is , you mentioned productivity growth March 21, 2018  Chairman Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 12 of 22  earlier."
" What ’s your current assessment of the path of productivity growth, and has anything in policy —any policy change in recent months changed that assessment?"
" In terms of productivity —productivity, as I ’m sure you know, has been very weak  since the financial crisis."
" And, you know, you asked me about fiscal policy and the connection to productivity."
 I think in the tax bill there’s —there are incentives for —there— a tax cut bill that allows expensing of investments should encourage additional i nvestment that should encourage productivity.
 So I do think it ’s very important that we have a focus on productivity in the country.
" You know, we ’ve been throug h many years of growth around 2 percent , and I ’ve given a number of public remarks where I ’ve called on, you know, the country to focus more on potential growth and productivity and labor force participation, wh ich drive potential growth."
" So, you know, I think it ’s really important that we do something —do what we can as a country to increase our  potential growth rate."
"  I would say in the bill that passed Congress, the Tax Cuts and Jobs A ct, there were elements t hat should encourag e productivity, as I mentioned—sorry, encourage investment, which should help productivity, encourage labor force participation."
 I have a question about the future of the mechanics of monetary policy.
 I wanted to know whether you favor sticking with the system that you have now of keeping interest on ex cess reserves and reverse repo—the reverse repo rate to control interest rates —or do you want to s hift back to the old way of doing things at  some point of targeting the fed funds market?
" And do you have any concern that if you do sti ck with the current system that , as rates rise, that you might see issues where the Fed is under —is being criticized fo r paying out ever larger shares of money to banks  to, you know, to control interest rates that some might perceive as a subsidy to the banks that are getting this money?"
 Our current framework for implementing monetary policy is wor king very well.
" For example, one —in the long -run, the size of the balance sheet  is going to depend on the public ’s demand for our liabilities , including currency and reserves."
"  So we don’ t know what the demand is for reserves in a world where you have —you know, you have regulations that require banks to hold lot s of highquality liquid assets, and reserves are one of those."
 We can ’t pay interest on excess reserves that are —is above the general level of short -term interest rates.
 So we ’re paying rates that banks can get from other interest rates from other —any other investment in the short -term money markets.
 I’d like to go back to the idea of the additional growth that you’ re getting from the fiscal package and ask you how much you think comes from the supply side and how much from demand?
" If I could try to summarize, it woul d be that , I think, broadly speaking , participants believe there will be meaningful increases in demand from the new fiscal policies for at least the next, let ’s say, three years."
" I think there ’s a general view as well that supply -side issues—that there could  be supply -side effects as well, and  you would see that again through higher investment, driven by lower corporate tax rates and the expensing of some investment , which would drive —tend to drive productivity over time."
" It isn ’t the only factor or the principle factor, but it should result in more investment, and investment should drive productivity."
" You said that participants today generally are feeling that the trade policy shouldn’ t necessarily affect the current economic outlook, but I am wondering if there was any discussio n—if there are fears about inflationary effects , should t here be trade barriers imposed?"
" They didn ’t get into talking about particular —you know, whether it ’s inflation or growth or whatever it would be."
 Does the interest rate hike today suggest that Americans are being paid enough?
 Are you satisfied with the rate of wage growth right now?
" As I mentioned, you know, we ’ve had unemployment decli ne sharply since, I guess, 2010, when it peaked at 10 percent and down to 4.1 percent now, and we’ve seen only modest increases in wages."
" So, on the one hand, what wages should in theory represent is inflation plus productivity increases."
 You should get paid for yo ur productivity plus inflation .
 And productivity ’s been very low.
 Inflation ’s been low.
" On the other hand, as the market ha s tightened, as labor markets have tightened, and we hear reports of labor shortages and  we see that, you know, groups of unemployed are diminishing, and the unemployment rate is going down, w e haven ’t seen, you know, higher wages —wages going up more."
" You know, we —we ’re looking very carefully at our assigned responsibilities of maximum employment, stable prices, and that ’s really our focus."
" I think it ’s true that yield curves have tended to predict recessions if you look back over many cycles, but a lot of that was just situations in which inflation was  allowed to get out of control, and the F ed had to tighten, and that put the economy into a recession."
