 My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on achieving our dual -mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices for the benefit of the American people.
"  The labor market has come into better balance , and the unemployment rate remains low."
  Inflation has eased substantially from a peak of 7 percent to 2.5 percent.
  We are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent goal in support of a strong economy that benefits everyone.
" Today, the F OMC decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to reduce our securities holdings."
 We are maintaining our restrictive stance of monetary policy in order to keep demand in line with supply and reduce inflationary pressures.
" We are att entive to risks on both sides of our dual mandate, and I will have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments."
 Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace.
"  GDP growth moderated to 2.1 percent in the first half of the year, down from 3.1 percent last year."
"  Private domestic final purchases, or PDFP—which excludes inventory investment, government spending, and net exports and usually sends a clearer signal of  underlying demand—grew at a 2.6 percent pace over that same period, the first half."
 Growth of consumer spending has slowed from last year’s robust pace but remains solid.
  Improving supply conditions have supported resilient demand and the strong performance of the U.S. economy over the past year.
" July 31, 202 4   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  Page 2 of 25   In the labor market, supply and demand conditions have come into better balance."
  The unemployment rate has moved up but remains low at 4.1 percent.
"  Nominal wage growth has eased over the past year, and the jobs -toworkers gap has narrowed."
Inflation has eased notably over the past two years but remains somewhat above our longer -run goal of 2 percent.
"  Longer -term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households and businesses and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets."
" My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship , as it erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation."
 Our monetary policy actions are guided by our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for t he American people.
" As the labor market has cooled and infla tion has declined, the risks to achieving our employment July 31, 202 4   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  Page 3 of 25   and inflation goals continue to move into better balance."
 We’ve stated that we do not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range for the federal funds rate until we have gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent.
" The second quarter’s inflation readings have added to our confidence, and more good data would further strengthen that confidence."
 We know that reducing policy restraint too soon or too much could result in  a reversal of the progress we have seen on inflation.
" At the same time, reducing policy restraint too late or too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment."
" As the economy evolves, monetary policy will adjust in order to best promote our maximum -employment and price -stability goals."
" If the economy remains solid and inflation persists, we can maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate as long as appropriate."
"  If the labor market were to weaken unexpectedly or inflation were to fall more quickly than anticipated, we are prepared to respond."
The Fed has been assigned two goals for monetary policy— maximum employment and stable prices.
  We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keeping longer -term inflation expectations well anchored.
 Restoring price stabi lity is essential to achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run.
 We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum -employment and price -stability goals.
" The question will be whether the totality of the data, the ev olving outlook, and the balance of risks are consistent with rising confidence on inflation and maintaining a solid labor market."
" So just to, to follow  up on that a bit , if inflation behaves as you expect between now and September, would you regard a cut in September as sort of the baseline scenario right now?"
" So if we were to see, for example, inflation moving down quickly or more or less in line with expectations, growth remains , let’s say , reasonably strong, and the labor market remains , you know, consistent with its current condition, then I would think that a , a rate cut could be on the table at the September meeting."
" If, if inflation were to prove , you know, sticky and we were to see higher readings from inflation, disappointing readings, we would weigh that along with the other things."
" I t’s going to be the inflation data , it’s going to be the employment data , it’s going to be the balance of risks as we see it —it’s going to be the totality of all of that that would help us make this decision."
" And just to follow  up on that —specifically , in what ways right now, given all you’ ve seen over the last few months, in particular on shelter, on services, et cetera, in what ways are you not confident right now that inflation is on the way back to 2 percent?"
" And we ’ve seen progress across all three categories of core PCE inflation —that’s goods , nonhousing services , and housing services."
" So it ’s really just—you know, we had a quarter of poor inflation data at the beginning of the year ."
 Then we saw some more good inflation data ; we had seven months at the end of last year.
"  The March  SEP pointed to three cuts in 2024, with core inflation at 2.6 percent and the unemployment rate at 4 percent."
" Since we’ re now at that level in terms of inflation and already beyond what was projected for the labor market, I ’m just wondering if that rate path is back to being the best guidepost for policy rather than, let’s say , the shallower one laid out in that June SEP."
"  Chair Powell, you ’ve said before that you wouldn’ t wait until inflation got to 2 percent to cut rates because of how inflation has lagged."
" And when you talk about seeing something that ’s more than whatever softness or slowdown you expect, in the past you’ ve said that stronger growth wouldn’ t, wouldn’t  override better news on inflation."
" If you’re seeing more softness in the labor market than what you would expect, does that change the calculus on what you’ re looking for out of the inflation numbers to recalibrate policy?"
" So w e have , we have —growth isn ’t one of our three."
" The labor market, maximum employment is one , and stable prices is another."
" When we were far away from our inflation mandate, we had to focus on that."
" And it wouldn’ t be any one statistic, although, of course , the unemployment rate is generally thought to be , you know, a single —a good single statistic ."
" I would say,  again, I think you’ re back to conditions that are close to 2019 conditions, and that was not an inflationary economy—broadly similar labor markets then ."
 I think inflation was actually —core inflation was actually running below 2 percent.
" So we don’ t think —I don’ t July 31, 202 4   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  Page 8 of 25   now think of the labor market in its current state as a likely source of significant inflationary pressures."
" The other part, of course, is that we have made real progress on inflation."
 You mentioned not wanting to see any further cooling in the job market .
" It’s a rough balance, but it does feel like, again, the labor market feels like it ’s in a place where it ’s just a process of ongoing normalization;  4.1 percent unemployment is still historically low ."
"  At the same time , we’re seeing progress on July 31, 202 4   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  Page 10 of 25   inflation."
" And if you look at the situation in the economy a year ago, unemployment —sorry , inflation was over 4 percent ."
" Now we ’ve made a lot of progress , and the labor market—I think unemployment was in the 3s, mid -3s, so it ’s a different economy ."
" The thing we ’re trying to do is —you know that we have, we ’ve had this really significant decline in inflation , and unemployment has remained low ."
" We think we don’ t need to be 100 percent focused on inflation because of the progress we’ ve made :  12month headline at 2½ [percent] , core at 2.6.  You know, it’ s way down from where it was."
" The job is not done on inflation, but , nonetheless, we can afford to begin to dial back the restriction in our policy rate."
" On inflation, do the past few months of good reports look like what we saw last year, where you really had a lot of momentum, with a few bumps in between?"
 This is a broader disinflation .
 We had seven months of low inflation ; you got one quarter of this.
" If that’ s what it is, then that actually implies that, that  other months were under reporting too low inflation."
" I want to stress that, and we ’re committed to July 31, 202 4   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  Page 12 of 25   getting the job—inflation sustainably under 2 percent, but we need to take note of that progress, and we need to weigh the risks to the labor market and the risks to our inflation target now more equally than we did a year ago."
" At this point, is the risk greater to leave interest rates where they are, given the damage that higher interest rates do to the economy in slowing demand and raising prices?"
 Or is it more important for the American people that you keep rates where they are to bring inflation down?
" This is how we serve the American people is by achieving maximum employment and price stability, right?"
" And so in our , you know, quasi -constitutional document, the Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, we look at the two goals , and if one of them is farther away than the other—the two variables , inflation and employment— if one is farther away from its goal than the other, then you , you concentrate on the one that ’s farther away."
" So, for the last couple of years , the best service we could do to the American people was to focus on inflation."
" But as inflation has come down —and I think the upside risks to inflation have decreased as the labor market has cooled off, and now  the labor market has softened —you know, probably the inflation, inflation ’s probably a little farther from its target than is employment, but I think the downside risks to, to  the employment mandate are , are real now."
 Are you certain that you won’ t fall behind the curve and lead to unnecessary unemployment if you wait until September?
" Of course , we’ll, we ’ll all look carefully at the employment report, but so much other data coming in and so much happening between now and the September meeting, and we ’ll, you know, we’ll make a judgment."
" There ’s a, a shift in the statement to balance between the focus between inflation and jobs."
" A nd I think you do look at private demand extra carefully, to your point about , about  government."
" We’ve been —you know, we , we had seven months of good inflation data at the end of last year ."
" A nd look at inflation—sorry —rate -sensitive, interest -sensitive spending."
" And that affects economic activity, hiring and that kind of thing , and, ultimately , inflation."
" So are you worried then that if monetary policy acts with long and variable lags, even when you’ re lowering interest rates, it might be too late for the F ed to help stave off any kind of slowdown in the labor market or broader economy?"
 W hat we ’re seeing —look at the —look at the  firsthalf growth numbers .
"Labor market—admittedly, the unemployment rate ha s moved up seven -tenths, and we ’re seeing —we’re seeing  normalization there, but wage , wage  increases are still at a high level ."
 Unemployment is still at a low level.
" On the labor market, I was wondering, how worried are you all about unemployment rising to the point where it triggers the Sahm r ule, and would that potentially affect how quickly you cut rates?"
" So, many, many received —pieces of received wisdom just haven ’t worked, and it ’s because this situation really is unusual or unique in that so much of this inflation came from the shutdown of the economy and the resulting supply problems in the face of, admittedly, very strong demand."
 So the whole —the whole  situation is not the same as many of the other prior inflation or downturns that we ’ve seen or business cycles that we ’ve seen.
" I t’s one of there are spots of weakness, and there are regions where growth is stronger than other regions, but , overall, it ’s—again, look at the aggregate data."
" The a ggregate data is—particula rly PDFP, private domestic f inal purchases —is 2.6 percent , and that ’s a good indicator of private —of private  demand."
 So it ’s just hard to measure economic activity.
"So if you take a step back, the current situation , again , is inflation has come down much closer to our goal, and that ’s happened while unemployment has remained low."
 There hasn ’t been a dissenting vote on an interest rate decision in some time.
"  If the data do evolve as you expect, if you do have more confidence by the September meeting, do you get the sense that there will be a unanimous vote on an interest rate move in September?"
" And then, this morning , we have the monetary policy go -round."
" And I think in people ’s economic or in their monetary policy go -round, people express their views about this, and , you know, there ’s a range of views."
 —assuming inflation comes ?
 Then we saw some higher inflation.
" We ’ve seen one quarter of good inflation, and we ’ve seen the labor market move quite a bit ."
" And, as I mentioned, I don’ t think it needs to cool off anymore for us to get the inflation results that are related to the labor market—not all inflation is , of course."
" What ’s in the data right now is an economy that’s growing at a —at a solid pace, a labor market that has cooled off, but , nonetheless, inflation —sorry , unemployment is low ."
" What we’ re seeing is strong economic activity and, you know, a good labor market and inflation coming down."
" I think people have understood for a long time , actually , that we were very focused on bringing down inflation."
" The data have, you know —again, we ’ve seen significant improvement in inflation just for the last quarter."
