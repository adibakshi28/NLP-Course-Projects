" Our decision reflect s our assessment that a gradua l removal of monetary policy accommodation will sustain a strong labor market while fosterin g a return of inflation to 2 percent, consistent with the maximum employment and price sta bility objectives assigned to us by law."
"Following a slowdown in the first qu arter, economic growth step ped up to a solid 3¼ percent pace in the second and third quarters of the year."
" While changes in tax policy will li kely provide some lift to economic activity in coming years, the magnitude and timing of the macroeconomic effects of any tax package remain uncertain."
" The unemployment rate has dec lined further in recent months and, at 4.1 percent in November, w as modestly below the median of FOMC participants’ estimates of its longerrun normal level."
 We expect that the job market will remain strong in the years ahead.
" We anticipate some further strengthening in labor market conditions in the mo nths ahead; however, we expect the pace of job gains to moderate  over time as we gradually red uce the degree of monetary policy accommodation."
" Allowing the l abor market to overheat wo uld raise the risk that monetary policy would need to tight en abruptly at a later stage , jeopardizing the economic expansion."
"Even with a firming of economic growth and a stronger labor mar ket, inflation has continued to run below the FOMC’s 2 percent longerrun objectiv e."
" As a result, we still expect inflation will move up and stabilize around 2 percent ov er the next couple of years."
" Nonetheless, as I’ve noted pr eviously, our understanding of the  forces driving inflation is imperfect."
" As emphasized in our sta tement, we will carefully m onitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to our symmetric inflation goal ."
" And, as I’ve noted before, we are prepared to adjust monetar y policy as needed to achieve our  inflation and employment objectives over the medium term."
" As always, participants conditioned their projections  on their own individual views of appropriate monetary policy, which, in turn, depend on each par ticipant’s assessment of the many factors that shape the out look."
" The median projection for  growth of inflationadjusted gross domestic product, or real  GDP, is 2½ percent this year an d next and moderates to 2 percent by 2020, a bit above its estimated longerrun rate."
" The median  projection for the unemployment rate stands at 4.1 percent in the  fourth quarter of this year a nd runs close to 4 percent over the next three years, modestly below the median estimate of its lon gerrun normal rate."
" Finally, the median inflation projection i s 1.7 percent this year, 1.9 perce nt next year, and 2 percent in 2019 and 2020."
" Compared with the projections made in September, rea l GDP growth is a little stronger, the unemployment rate i s a bit lower, a nd inflation i s essentially unchanged."
"Returning to monetar y policy, for the past two years the FOMC h as been gradually increasing its target range for  the federal funds rate as the e conomy has continued to make progress toward our goals of maxim um employment and price stabi lity."
This view is consistent with par ticipants’ projections of appro priate monetary policy.
" As we’ve noted pr eviously, changing the target range for the feder al funds rate is our primary means of adjusting the  stance of monetary policy, a nd we do not foresee a need to alter our balance sheet norma lization program."
 T here have been thoughts that wit h these changes happening at a time when the economy is already—with unemployment so low—that the Fed may be forced to increase its pace on rate hikes .
" I think my colleagues and I are in line wit h the general expectation among  most economists that the type of tax changes that are likely t o be enacted would tend to provide  some modest lift to GDP growth in the coming years, and you see that—in part, that’s one of th e reasons, I think, for the uptick you see in estimated growth and decline in the unemployment rat e."
"Now, to the extent that the c hanges do have positive impact on the growth of potential GDP and longerrun growth, let me just say that this is somethi ng that, should it occur, would be very welcome to participants, as long as it’s consistent with t he attainment of our employment and inflation objectives."
" I gue ss I would also urge you to rem ember that when you look at the projections, that there are ma ny factors that affect those proj ections, and changes in tax policy—that’s only one of a number of f actors, including incoming data  that has, to some extent, altered the outlook for growth and infla tion."
" That leaves  me—that’s one factor, along wit h the fact that inflation remains low—with feeling that even though we have a 4.1 percent unemplo yment rate, that the labor market is not overheated at thi s point."
" Remember, the modest p ace of wage gains also probably reflects slow productivity growth."
" But when you ask me about t he outlook for  inflation, you know, I’ve talked in detail abou t this in the past and recogniz e that there is uncertainty about what’s holding inflation down."
 But  my colleagues and I continu e to believe that th e factors that are responsible this year for hol ding inflation down are likely  to prove transitory.
" This is a s ymmetric 2 percent inflation o bjective, and we continue to indicate that we’ll be monitori ng inflation developments closel y."
" When yo u addressed it earlier today, and when you spoke to Congress last  month, you often describe that you would welcome higher growth in the context of the emp loyment and inflation mandate."
" Do you see thos e, on balance, boosting the produc tive capacity of the U.S. economy as opposed to simply increasing aggregate demand?"
" And, related  to that, how would you view December 13, 2017 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL  Page 8 of 27  the benefit of such tax changes  now, when the economy is nearin g full employment, versus at earlier periods when there was greater resource slack?"
" So I think my colleagues and I mainly see the li kely tax package as boosting aggregate demand, but als o having some potential to bo ost aggregate supply."
"In terms of aggregate supply effects, a stronger pace of invest ment could boost capital formation and thereby raise produ ctivity growth and potential G DP or output to some extent."
" And, to the extent that there  are larger impacts than those analyses assume on aggregate s upply or potential GDP, in the co ntext of an economy that has had disturbingly low productivit y growth, that would be welcome  and could support faster GDP growth, at least for some  period, without—you know, without cre ating a need to tighten monetary policy to offset that."
So there are potentially bot h demand and supply effects here.
" Participants do December 13, 2017 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL  Page 9 of 27  recognize that the unemployment ra te is lower than their estima tes of its longrun sustainable rate, so I think we ar e in the vicinity of full employment."
" Well, I think, gene rally, in a strong labor mark et where many firms are having difficulty finding quali fied workers, we would expec t, just through normal demand and supply channels, to see some  upward pressure on wage growth  over time."
" We’re enjoying solid economic growth with low inflati on, and the risks in the global  economy look more balanced than they have in many years ."
" We have a much more resilient, stronger banking system , and we’re not seeing some worrisome buildup in leverage or credit growth at successive le vels.1  So, you know, this is something that the FOMC pays  attention to, but if you ask me, i s this a significant factor shaping monetary policy now, we ll, it’s on the list of risks, it’s not a major—it’s not a major factor."
" It is not a sta ble source of—store of value, and it                                                  1 Chair Yellen intended to say that credit growth is not at excessive  levels."
" So, look, I will just  say that it is up to the A dministration and Congress to decide on appropr iate fiscal policy, and our job is  to maintain our focus on employment and inflation."
" First of all, midwa y through the year you talked ab out the issue of whether inflation targets might need to be raise d."
" It ma y not be an imminent issue, but do  you expect it to be something the Fed should be discussing over the coming years as some sort of change to the inflation target?"
" One of the incoming gover nors, Marvin Goodfriend, has talked about the merits of negativ e interest rates."
 So right now the F OMC is not discussing or consi dering its inflation target.
" We do see inflation as likely moving up to target over  the next couple of years, and I would say—you said our stimulus too ls are limited."
" So I think we’re not—I wouldn’t say that we’re out of ammunitio n, but certainly it’s been recognized—and I’ve emphasized mys elf that, in the longer run, we may be—and we’ll have to December 13, 2017 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL  Page 14 of 27  see how this works out, but we ma y be in low interest rate envi ronments where it could prove useful to have additional scope  to conduct monetary policy."
" So you do believe tha t negative interest rates, a t least in theory, are possible in the U.S. at some point if it should be necessary—at  least in theory."
" You’ve said that you’re expe cting a tax package to deliver a significant stimulus, and that it will be on the demand side."
 You expect growth to be faster.
" You expect unemployment to be lower , and yet somehow inflation is g oing to remain at 2 percent for the foreseeable future."
 Coul d you describe what has changed ab out your economic assessment so that everything has cha nged except inflation?
"But, look, generally, you see modes tly faster growth over the n ext couple of years, which is consistent and, I said, I thi nk for most participants, refle cts partly an impact from taxes stimulating consumer and investment spending."
 But it’s not a g igantic increase in growth that since—relative to September.
"You do see a lower path for unemployment, but remember that inf lation has also been running low on a persistent basis,  and the Committee does have a concern about inflation and wants to see it moving up."
" Well, okay, growth is a little stronger, the unemployment rate runs a little bit lower— that would perhaps push in the direction of slightly tighter  monetary policy."
" But, again, cou nterbalancing that is that inflation has run lower than we expect , and, you know, it could take a lo nger period of a very strong labor market in order to achieve  the inflation objective."
" These are votes on national monetary policy, after all."
"  I mean, we’re not doing negative interest rates."
" The growth that we’re seeing, it’s not based on, for ex ample, an unsustainable buildu p of debt as we had in the runup December 13, 2017 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL  Page 21 of 27  to the financial crisis."
" We’ve got a  good, strong labor market and a very low unemployment rate, and I  think that’s been tremendousl y important to the wellbeing of American households and workers ."
" We have a 2 percent symme tric inflation objective, and, for a number of  years now, inflation has been r unning under 2 percent."
" And I consider it an important prior ity to make sure that inflation d oesn’t chronically undershoot our 2 percent objective, and I wa nt to see it move up to 2 percent."
" Chair Y ellen, what do you think will be  the drivers of inflation over the next couple of years, and how long will the Committee go with low unemployment, low inflation befo re you rethink monetary policy— this gradual rate hikes?"
" So, you know, I think f or a number of years—so w e’ve had an undershoot of inflation for a numbe r of years."
" And, beginning in mid2014,  there was a marked depreciation in the dollar.2  And those three factors hel d down inflation for a number of y ears."
"  Now, in 2016, core inflation came  very close to 2 percent."
" We seemed to be on a path of inflation moving up, and this ye ar, beginning in March, there s eemed to be a sequence of negative surprises."
 There are errors and many factors that affect i t beyond the key influences of la bor market slack:  exchange rates and import prices and oil prices .
" B ut there are other factors that affect inflation too, and our judgment at  this point is that transitor y factors that are unrelated to the broader macroeconomic outl ook are holding inflation down."
" It’s ver y important to watch it and, if necessary, rethink what’s determ ining inflation."
"December 13, 2017 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL  Page 23 of 27  rate of unemployment is—it’s b een coming down."
" So there are—you know,  there could be a rethink of inflation."
" I think it’s importa nt to watch inflation outcomes carefully and, if we don’t see inflation moving in the manner that  the Committee anticipates, to alter policy so that we do achieve our 2 percent ob jective."
" President Trump, while you were speaking, jus t said that he thinks his ta x plan will produce 4 percent growth."
" It is challenging, however, to achieve growth of the level s that you mentioned."
" Look, if t he package were to stimulate growth of that magnitude, let me just say again, the Federal Re serve would welcome that."
" If it’s a supplyside—favorable supplysi de developments that would be compatible with the attainment of our employment a nd inflation objectives, that’s s omething that would be very, very welcome."
" One is the expected average value of short rates over, say, 10 years, and the second piece of it is a soca lled term premium that often reflects thi ngs like inflation—inflation risk."
" And typically that means that monetary policy is restrictive, sometimes quite rest rictive, and some of those recessions were situations in which the Fed was consciously tig htening monetary policy because inflation was high and trying to slow the economy."
