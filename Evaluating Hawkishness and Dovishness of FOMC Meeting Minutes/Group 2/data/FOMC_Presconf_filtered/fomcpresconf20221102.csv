 My colleagues and I are strongly committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal.
" Today, the FOMC  raised our  policy interest rate by 75 basis point s."
 We are moving our policy stance purposefully to a level that will be sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent.
 I will have more to say about today’s monetary policy actions after briefly reviewing economic development s.
 R ecent indicators point to modest growth of spending and production this quarter .
" Growth in consumer spending has slowed from last year’s rapid pace, in part reflecting lower real disposable income and tighter financial conditions."
 Higher intere st rates and slower output growth also appear to be weighing on business fixed investment .
"Despite the slowdown in growth, the labor market remains extremely tight, with the unemployment rate at  a 50year low, job vacancies still very high, and wage growth elevated."
" November 2, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 2 of 23  Job gains have been robust, with employment rising by an average of 289,000 jobs per month over August and September."
" Although job vacancies have moved below their highs and the pace of job gains has slowed from earlier in the year, the labor market continues to be out of balance, with demand substantially exceeding the supply of available workers."
Inflation remains well above our longerrun goal of 2 percent.
 And the recent inflation data again have come in higher than expected.
 Russia’s war against Ukraine has boosted prices for energy and food and has created  additional upward pressure on inflation.
"Despite elevated inflation, longerterm inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, a s well as measures from financial market s."
" But that is  not grounds for complacency; the longer the current bout of high inflation continues, the greater the chance that expectations of higher inflation will become entrenched."
The Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.
" My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship  as it erodes purchasing power, especially for  those least abl e to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation."
" We are highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective."
" With today’s action, we have raised interest rates by 3 ¾ percentage points this year."
 W e anticipate that ongoing increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate  in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time.
" Financial conditions have tightened significantly in response to our policy actions, and we are seeing the effects on demand in the most interest -ratesensitive sectors of the economy, such as housing."
" It will take time, however, for the full effects of monetary restraint to be realized, especially on inflation."
" That’s why we say in our statement that i n determining the pace of future increases in the target range , we will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy and the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation ."
 At some point —as I’ve said in the last two press conferences—it will become appropriate to slow the pace of increases as we approach the level of interest rates that will be sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to our 2 percent goal.
 There is significant uncertainty around that level  of interest rates.
" Even so, we still have some ways to go, and incoming data since our  last meeting suggest that the ultimate level of interest rates will be higher than previously expected."
 Our decisions will depend on the totality of incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and in flation.
We are taking forceful steps to moderate demand so that it comes into better alignment with supply.
 Our overarching focus is using our  tools to bring inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keep longer -term inflation expectations well anchored .
" Reducing inflation November 2, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 4 of 23   is likely to require a sustained period of below -trend growth and some softening of labor market conditions."
 Restor ing price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices in the longer  run.
 We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum -employment and price -stability goals.
"  On the need to slow the pace of rate increases at some point :  Is a downshift contingent on a string of better  inflation data specifically between now and , let’s say , the December meeting?"
" We do need to see inflation coming down decisively , and good evidence of that would be a series of down monthly readings."
 We need to bring our policy stance down to a level that ’s sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to our 2 percent objective over the medium term.
" Well, we’ ll take into account the full range of analysis and data that bear on that question, guided by our assessment of how much financial conditions have tightened, the effects that that tightening is actually having on the real economy and on inflation, November 2, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 5 of 23   taking into consideration lags, as I mentioned."
" It’s a historically fast pace , and that ’s certainly appropriate given the persistence and streng th in inflation and the low level from which we started."
" And we’re saying that we’ d raise that rate to a level that ’s sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation to our 2 percent target over time , and we put that into our postmeeting statement because that really does become the important question,  we think now, is how far to go."
" Of course , with the lags between policy and economic activity, there ’s a lot of uncertainty, so we note t hat in determining the pace of future increases, we ’ll take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy as well as the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation."
" To be clear , let me say again  [that] the question  of when to moderate the pace of increases is now much less important than the question of how high to raise rates and how long to keep monetary policy restricted, which really will be our princip al focus."
" I think there ’s—very difficult  to make a case that our current level is too tight, given that inflation still runs well above the  federal f unds r ate."
"  Chair Powell, core PCE inflation on a 3or 6month annualized basis and on a 12month basis has been running in the high 4s, close to 5 percent."
 Is there any reason to think you won’ t have to raise rates at least above that level to be confident that you are imparting enough restraint to bring inflation down?
" So this is the question of , does the policy rate need to get above the inflation rate?"
" But I would think you’ d look more at a forward, a forward -looking measure of inflation to look at that."
" But I think the answer is , we’ll want to get the policy rate to a level where it is, where the real interest rate is positive."
" So households and businesses, if they’ re [borrowing] —[there are] very meaningfully positive interest rates all across the curve for them, credit spreads are larger, so borrowing rates are significantly higher , and I think financial conditions have tightened quite a bit."
" If I could follow  up:  W hat is your best assessment , or the staff ’s best assessment right now , of the current rate of underlying inflation?"
" And, I mean , one way to look at it is  that it ’s a pretty stationary object and that when inflation runs —above that level , for sure —substantially above for some time, you’ll see it move up , but the movement will be fairly gradual."
" There are many different —as you know, many different people publish an assessment of underlying inflation."
"  I wondered, do you see any evidence at this stage that inflation is , or is at risk of becoming , entrenched?"
 Is inflation becoming entrenched?
" Shorter -term inflation expectations moved up between the last meeting and this meeting, and we don’ t think those are as indicative , but they may be important in the wage -setting process."
" I guess the other thing I would say is that the longer we have —we ’re now 18 months into this episode of high inflation , and we don’ t have a clearly identified , scientific way of November 2, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 9 of 23   understanding at what point inflation becomes entrenched."
 And so the thing we need to do from a risk -management standpoint is to use our tools forcefully but thoughtfully and get inflation under control —get it down to 2 percent —get it behind us.
" So the way I would think about that is , it’s commonly, for a long time, thought that monetary policy works with “ long and variable lags ,” and that it works first on financial conditions and then on economic activity and then perhaps later than that even on inflation."
"  The truth is, we don’ t have a lot of data [consisting] of inflation of [rates] this high i n what is , now , the modern economy."
" One big difference now is that it used to be that you would raise the f ederal funds r ate, financial conditions would react , and then that would affect economic activity and inflation."
 Now financial conditions react wel l before in  expectation of monetary policy  [actions] .
" That’s the way it has moved for a quarter of a century —in the direction of financial conditions , then monetary policy—because the markets are thinking , what  is the c entral bank going to do?"
" So I think it ’s a very difficult place to be, but I would t end to be —want to be in the middle looking carefully at what ’s actually happening with the economy a nd trying to make good decisions from a riskmanagement standpoint, remembering , of course , that if we were to overtighten, we could then use our tools strongly to support the economy, whereas if we don’ t get inflation under control because we don’t tighten enough, now we ’re in a situation where inflation will become entrenched and the costs, the employment costs in particular, will be much higher potentially ."
" Of course, we think about lag s—the lags are just sort of a basic part of monetary policy ."
" It’s been relatively narrow in terms of the labor market, consumer demand;  a lot of sectors , you don’ t see a ton of effect."
 Is the pathway and channels through which monetary policy works changing?
" So w e go into this with a strong labor market and excess demand in the labor market, as you can see through many different things , and also with households who have strong spending power built up."
" I t’s likely to, to get inflation down."
" It may—I think you see , from our forecasts and others, that it will take some time for inflation to come down."
" You know, I would say housing was —the housing market was very overheated for the couple of years after the pandemic as demand increased and rates were low."
 So the housing mar ket needs to get back into a balance between supply and demand.
" So, for example, if wage growth is slowing and if maybe the unemployment rate starts to tick up, will that make you sort of decrease your focus on job openings?"
 How are you thinking about the labor market as it relates to inflation?
 So we look at a very wide range of data on the unemployment —on the labor m arket.
" So I’d start with unemployment , November 2, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 13 of 23   which is typically the single statistic you would look to, is at a 50 -year low, 3½ percent ."
" It’s true , with average hourly earnings , you see —so I would call  it a flattening out at a level that’s well  above the level that would be consistent over time with 2 percent inflation, assuming a reasonable productivity."
" Overall , though, the broader picture is of an overheated labor market where demand substantially exceeds supply."
 So do you see wages as being a significant driver of inflation?
 I think wages have an effect on inflation and inflation has an effect on wages.
 We wan t wages to go up —we just want them to go up at a level that ’s sustainable and consistent with 2 percent inflation.
" And we think we can —we do think that , given the data that we have, that this labor market can soften without having to soften as much as history would indicate through the unemployment channel."
" W e’re seeing very high inflation in Europe, significantly be cause of high energy prices related to the war in Ukraine."
" And we ’re seeing China ’s having issues with the November 2, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 15 of 23   zeroCOVID policy and much slower growth than we ’re used to seeing."
" Here in the United States , we have a strong economy, and we have an economy where inflation is running at 5 percent ."
" Core PCE inflation —which is a really good indicator of what ’s going on for us , the way we see it —is running at 5.1 percent on a 12month basis and sort of similar to that on a 3- , 6-, and 9month basis."
 So we know that we need to use our tools to get inflation under control.
" So we don’ t directly affect , for the most part, food and energy prices, but the demand channel  does affect them just at the marg in."
" In the United States , we also have a demand issue."
" We’ ve got an imbalance between demand and supply, which you see in many parts of the economy."
" I think by the actions that we take , though, we help keep longer -term inflation expectations anchored and keep the public believing in 2 percent inflation by the things that we do, even in times when energy is part of the story of why inflation is high."
 It can be doing that because it affects— it expects cuts or because it expects inflation to come down.
" In this case, if you’re in a situation where the markets are pricing in  significant declines in inflation, that ’s November 2, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 18 of 23   going to affect the forward curve ."
" Well , what ’s happened is , time has passed , and we ’ve raised interest rates by 375 basis points."
" I think until we get inflation down, you’ ll be hearing that from me."
" On the other hand, if you make the mistake in the other direction and you let this drag on, then it ’s a year or two down the road, and you’ re realizing , inflation behaving the way it can, you ’re realizing you didn’ t actually get it, you have to go back in."
 A nd the record is that the employment costs —the cost to the people that we don’ t want to hurt—they go up with the passage of time.
" Just to go back to housing for a minute :  You mentioned the impact that rate increases have had on housing—h ome sales are down 25 percent in the past year , and so forth —but none of this is really showing up in, as you know, in the government ’s inflation measures."
" And that makes sense, actually , because fo r that reason —conceptually , that is —that ’s sort of the right target for monetary policy."
" But at some point, once you get through that, the new leases are going to tell you —what they ’re telling you is , there will come a point at which rent inflation will start to come down."
" B ut I would say that in terms of—the right way to think about inflation , really , is to look at the measure that we do look at, but considering tha t we also know that at some point , you’ ll see rents coming down."
" Our message should be —what I ’m trying to do is make sure that our message is clear, which is that we think we have a ways to go, we have some ground to cover with interest rates before we get to, before we get to that level of interest rates that we think is sufficiently restrictive."
" I mean , I would have little confidence that the forecast— if we made a forecast today, if we were doing an SEP today, the pattern has been that , one after  another , they go up , and that ’ll end when it ends, but there ’s no sense that inflation is coming down."
 So how big of a headwind is all the fiscal spending to what the Federal Reserve ’s trying to do to get inflation back to the 2 percent target?
" It appears, consumer spending is still positive —it’s at pretty m odest growth levels ."
" There ’s tens of billions yet to be spent , I mean , from the Inflation Reduction Act, the American Rescue Plan, CHIPS Act, bipartisan infrastructure bill."
  Demand is going to have some support from those savings and also from the strong demand that ’s still in the labor market.
" We still see pretty significant demand and a tightening labor market in some respects, although I think, overall , I would say it ’s not really t ightening or loosening."
" Again, I would say that the sort of array of data in the labor market is highly unusual and, to many economists, there is a path to—ordinarily there ’s a relationship to GDP going down and vacancies declining, translating into unemployment , or there ’s Okun’ s law."
  Because we haven ’t seen inflation coming down.
 The implication of inflation not coming down.
" W hat we would expect by now to have seen is that as the —really , as the supply -side problems have resolved themselv es, we would have expected goods inflation to November 2, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 23 of 23   come down by now, long since by now."
" At the same time, now you see services inflation, core services inflation moving up, and I just think that the inflation picture has become more and more challenging over the course of this year, without question."
