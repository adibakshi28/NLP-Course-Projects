" As indicated in our policy statement, the FOMC “reaffirmed its view that the current 0 to ¼ percen t target range for the federal funds rate remains appropriate.”  The Committee also updated its forward guidance for the federal funds rate, indicating that “the Committee j udges that it can be patient in beginning to normalize the stance of monetary policy.”  This new language does not represent a change  in our policy intentions and is fully consistent with our previous guidance, wh ich stated that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal f unds rate for a considerable time after the end of our asset purchase program."
"In the labor market, progress continues toward the FOMC’s objective of maximum employment."
" The pace of job growth has been strong recently, with job gains averaging nearly 280,000 per month over the past 3 months; over the past 12 months, job gains averaged nearly 230,000 per month."
" The unemployment rate was 5.8 percent in November, threetenths lower than the latest reading availabl e at the time of the September FO MC meeting."
" Smoothing through the quarterly ups and downs earlier this year, real GDP expanded around 2½ percent over the four quarters ending in the third quarter, and the availa ble indicators suggest that economic growth is running at roughly that pace in the current quar ter."
 The Committee continues to expect a moderate pace of growth going forward.
"Inflation has continued to r un below the Committee’s 2 percen t objective, and the recent sizable declines in oil prices wi ll likely hold down overall inflation in the near term."
" But as the effects of these oil price declines  and other transitory factors dissi pate and as resource utilization continues to rise, the Committee expects inflation to  move gradually back toward its objective."
" In making this forecast, the Committee is mindf ul of the recent declines in marketbased measures of inflation compensation."
" At this point, the Committee vi ews these movements as likely to prove transitory, and surveybased measur es of longerterm inflation expectations have remained stable."
" As always, each participant’s projections are conditioned on his or her own view of appropriate monetary policy."
" The central tendency of the unemployment rate projections is slightly lowe r than in the September projections and now stands at 5.2 to 5.3 percent at the end of next year, in line w ith its estimated longerrun normal level."
" Committee participants generally see the unemployment rate declin ing a little further over December 17, 2014 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL  Page 3 of 23  the course of 2016 and 2017."
" The central tendency of the projections for real GDP growth is 2.3 to 2.4 percent for 2014, up a bit from the September projections."
" Over the next three years, the projections for real GDP growth run somewhat above the estimates of longerrun normal growth."
" Finally, although FOMC pa rticipants project inflation in the near term to be lower on account of the decline in energy prices, they co ntinue to see inflation moving gradually back toward 2 percent."
" The central tendency of the inflation projections is 1.0 to 1.6 percent next year, rising to 1.8 to 2.0 percent in 2017."
"As I noted earlier, the Committee “reaffirmed its view that the cu rrent 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate remains appropriate.”  Regarding forward guidance for the federal funds rate, our October statement indicated that it likely would be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate  for a considerable time following the end of our asset purchase program, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee’s 2 percent longerrun goal."
" Today’s statement, which indicates that  “the Committee judges that it can be patient in beginning to normalize the stan ce of monetary policy,” does not signify any change in the Committee’s polic y intentions as set forth in its recent statements."
" As before, this judgment is based on the Committee’s assessment of  realized and expected progress toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation—an assessment that is based on a wide range of information, includ ing measures of labor market c onditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, a nd readings on financial developments."
" Employment is rising at a healthy rate and the U.S. economy is strengthening, reflecting, in part, a highly accomm odative stance of monetary policy."
" Of course, inflation has been running somewhat below our go al of 2 percent, but we  project that gap to close gradually over time."
" As progress in achieving maximum employment and 2 percent inflation continues, at some point it will become appropriate to begin reducing policy accommodation."
" If incoming information indicates faster progress toward the Committee’s employment and inflation objectives than the Committee now expects, then increases in the target  range for the federal funds rate are likely to occur sooner than curren tly anticipated."
"Once we begin to remove policy accommoda tion, it continues to be the Committee’s assessment that, “even after employment and in flation are near manda teconsistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run.”  This guidance is consistent with the paths for appropriate policy given by FOMC pa rticipants."
 They also expect core inflat ion to be running near current levels but foresee being reasonably confid ent in their expectation that inflation will move back toward our 2 percent longerrun inflation obj ective over time.
"By late 2016, the median projection for the federal funds rate, at 2.5 percent, remains more than 1 percentage point below the longerru n value of 3¾ percent or so projected by most participants, even though the centr al tendency of the unemployment rate by that time is slightly below its estimated longerrun value and the centr al tendency for inflation is close to our 2 percent objective."
 The Committee’s sizable holdings of longerterm secu rities should help maintain accommodative financial conditions and promote further pr ogress toward our objectives of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent.
" And can you also speak to the downdraft we’re seeing in inflation now and, in particular, the marketbased inflation expect ations and whether that gives the Committee any hesitance about proceeding towards liftoff in the months ahead?"
"You asked also, I think, about inflation."
" A nd, as I mentioned in my press statement, especially with the downward pressures on inflat ion that we expect to see for a little while because of declining oil prices and falling import pr ices, we certainly expect headline inflation to December 17, 2014 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL  Page 7 of 23  be under downward pressure for a while."
 And they do largely expect that inflation will be—core inflation will probably be running close to its current level.
 And headline inflation could ev en be lower.
" And, of course, as labor market conditions continue to improve, history suggests that as long as inflation expectations remain well anchored, that that’s likely to occur."
" Was there concern—S teve Liesman, CNBC—was there concern expressed at the meeting that the signal comi ng from markets—and a variety of markets—lower oil prices, lower yields around the world, was one of deflation, and that that risk was one that should, perhaps, overshadow the concer n about inflation on the other side?"
"With respect to deflation, we see downward pr essure on headline inflation from declining energy prices."
" We certainly recognize that that  is going to be pushing down headline inflation and may even spill over, to some extent, to core inflation."
" But, at this point, although we indicated we’re monitoring inflation developmen ts carefully, we see these developments as transitory."
" And the Committee continues to be lieve—especially with the improvement we’re seeing in the labor market, which we expect to continue—that inflation will move back up to our December 17, 2014 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL  Page 9 of 23  2 percent objective over time."
" Madame Chair, there’s a big gap between the pace markets expect you to rais e interest rates and th e rate you’ve indicated in your “dot plot.”  Are markets mis understanding your intentions?"
" There are a number of different  factors that are b earing on the path of market interest rates, I think, in cluding global economic developments ."
" It is often the case that when oil prices move down and the dollar apprecia tes, that that tends to put downward pressure on inflation compensation and on longerterm rates."
" Well I—I’d sa y, you know, that I think what we have seen since the mid-’80s is that, in an environment where in flation expectations ar e well anchored, that movements in oil and commodity pr ices and import prices tend to have transitory effects on the inflation outlook."
" There were many years in which we  had unanticipated increa ses in oil prices,   really beginning in 2004 and 2005, that put upwar d pressure on headline inflation and sometimes even spilled through into core, and, typicall y, the Committee looked through those impacts on inflation with the view that they would be transi tory."
" Inflation, even core inflation, has been running below our inflation objective."
" Movements in oil, you know, now down and perhaps later up, will move inflation around, certainly headline inflation."
" So as long as participants December 17, 2014 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL  Page 11 of 23  feel reasonably confident that the inflation pr ojection is one where we  expect to meet our 2 percent objective ove r time, that’s what I thi nk how they’ll be looking at  things as we decide on the path for the funds rate."
" And when you talk about reasonab le confidence in infla tion expectations, can you elaborate a little bit a bout what it would take to give you re asonable confidence that inflation is headed back to 2 percent?"
" And with respect to infl ation—our forecast for inflation and inflation expectations, let me start by saying I think it’s important th at monetary policy be forward looking."
" The lags in monetary policy are long, and, therefore, the Committee has to base its decisions on how to set the federal funds rate looking into the future."
" Typically, we have seen that as long as inflation expectations are well anchored, that as  the labor market recove rs, we’ll gradually see upward pressure on both wages and prices, and th at inflation will tend to move back toward 2 percent."
" I think historically we have see n, as the economy strengthens and slack diminishes, that inflation does tend to gr adually rise over time."
" And I re ally don’t have much for you other than to say that they will be data de pendent—that, over time, the stance of policy will be adjusted to try to keep the economy on a tr ack where we see contin uing progress toward achieving our goals of maximum employment and price stability."
 We are pr oviding a very highly accommodative monetary policy.
" And even as we begin to normalize the stance of monetary polic y, when that becomes appropriate, it’s important to remember that monetary policy will stil l be very accommodative for a long time."
" Chair Yellen, the Committee’ s projections show unemployment running below your own views on where full em ployment should be for the next several years."
" And, related to the question that Jon Hilsenrath aske d earlier, you’ve called the decline in inflation—December 17, 2014 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL  Page 13 of 23  and marketbased measures of inflation expectati ons—transitory."
 So we ’re talking about expect ations that inflation many years from now will be below target.
 So you—your fi rst question is:  Why is it that the Committee sees unemployment as declining sligh tly below its estimate of the longerrun natura l rate?
" And, I think, in part, the reason for that is that in flation is running below our objective, and the Committee wants to see inflation move back towa rd our objective over time ."
 And a short period of a very slight undershoot of unemployment below th e natural rate will facili tate a slightly faster return of inflation to our object ive.
" It is, I should say, a very small undershoot in a situation where there is great uncertainty about exactly  what constitutes maximum employment or a longerrun normal rate of unemployment."
 We also  do see the different measures of slack in the labor market point to different assessments of just what maximum employment is.
" The standard unemployment rate, for quite some time now, has b een signaling a little bit less slack in the labor market than measures that are somewhat broade r that, for example, include the unusually large number of people who were parttime employed but  would prefer fulltime jobs."
" And so it may be  that with a very small undershoot of this longerrun normal level of the unemployment ra te, as measured by the standard unemployment rate, we’ll be seeing some further progress on those other margins of slack."
 But it’s important to point out that the Committee is not anticipating an ove rshoot of its 2 percent inflation objective.
" Well, wh at I would say, we refer to this in the statement as “inflation compensation” rather than  “inflation expectations.”  The gap between the nominal yields on 10year Treasuries, for exam ple, and TIPS have declined—that’s inflation compensation."
" That could reflect a change in inflati on expectations, bu t it could also reflect ch anges in assessment of inflation risks."
" The risk prem ium that’s necessary to compen sate for inflation, that might especially have fallen if the proba bilities attached to very high in flation have come down."
 So I th ink the jury is out about exactly how to interpret that downward move in inflation compensation.
 And we indicated that we are monitoring inflation developments carefully.
" Many members of the Committee, participants, ha ve said that they think policy should be based on the actual evolution of economic activity and inflation, wh ich tends to be variable over time, and that’s why I say I anticipate it will be data dependent."
" We have continued to provide guidance, the same guidance that we have for so me time, that says the Committee “anticipates that, even after employment and inflation ar e near mandateconsistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping th e target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run.”   I know that’s a mouthful, but it says, in eff ect, that the Committee believes that the economic conditions that have made recovery di fficult, we’re getting beyond them."
" They see the longerrun normal level of interest rates as December 17, 2014 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL  Page 16 of 23  around 3¾ percent."
 So there’s no view in the Co mmittee that there is secular stagnation in the sense that we won’t eventually get back to pretty historically normal levels of interest rates.
" But they have said, it’ll, you know , the economy has required to get where it is a good deal of monetary policy accommodation; we expect to be  able to normalize policy."
" But, until those conditions have lifted that have held back economic activity, mone tary policy will need to stay accommodative."
 I’d also like to get off monetary policy and ask you a bout the Federal Reserve’s re lationship with Congress.
" So let me simply say that Congress has assigned us  important tasks in monetary policy and in other role s that we perform, and the Fede ral Reserve is highly focused on attempting to carry out the mandates that Congress has given us in the area of monetary policy."
" You know, I would say that the ability of a central bank to make the decisions about monetary policy that it regards as  in the best longerrun interest s of the economy, free of shortrun political interference,  is very important to the effective conduct of monetary policy."
" So I do think central bank independence is very important, and that it’s  important to make sure that we  can make the decisions we think are best, free of shortrun political inte rference with respect to monetary policy."
" Back in 1978, Congr ess explicitly passed legislation to ensure that there would be no GAO audits of monetary policy decisionmaking— namely, policy audits."
" And also, I’ll stay off of interest rates."
" I will go back to interest rates, if you don’t mind."
" Actual ly, it’s a question about balance sheet effects on the overall appropriate le vel of monetary policy."
" In the past, it’s said that the large portfolio of securities will exer t a downward effect on longterm interest rates."
" So I agree, and that’s why we  stated that we typically think of the monetary policy impact of our a sset purchases as depending on the stock of assets that we hold on our balance sheet rather than the flow of purchases, and so we ’re reminding the public that we continue to hold a large stock of assets, and that is tending to push down term premiums in longerterm yields."
" Rather than actively planning to sell the assets that we’v e put onto our balance sheet, sometime after we begin raising our targets for s hortterm interest rates, depending on economic and financial conditions, we’re likely to reduc e or cease reinvestment and gra dually run down the stock of our December 17, 2014 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL  Page 22 of 23  assets."
