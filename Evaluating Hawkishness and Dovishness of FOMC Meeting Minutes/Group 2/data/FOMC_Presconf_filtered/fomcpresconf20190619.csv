" My colleagues and I have one overarching goal:  to sustain the economic expansion, with a strong job market and stable prices, for the benefit of the American people."
"   At the FOMC meeting that concluded today, we maintained our policy interest rate but made some significant changes to our statement."
" In light of increased uncertainties and muted inflation pressures, we now emphasize  that the Committee will closely monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion with a strong labor market and inflation near its 2 percent objective."
" So far this year, the economy has performed reasonably well, with solid fundamentals supporting continued growth and strong employment."
" Inflation has been running some what below our objective, but we have expected it to pick up, supported by solid growth and a strong job market."
" Along with this favorable picture, we have been mindful of some ongoing crosscurrents, including trade developments and concerns about global growth."
" Growth indicators from around the world have disappointe d, on net, raising concerns about the strength of the June 19, 2019     Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 2 of 22   global economy."
" Against this back drop, inflation remains muted."
"While the baseline outlook remains favorable, the question is whether these uncertainties will continue to weigh on the outlook and thus call for additional monetary policy accommodation."
" Let me explain the basis for this judgment, starting with th e outlook for jobs and growth."
 Participants see unemployment remaining low this year and next.
" Committee participants’ growth projections from 2019 are little revised from March, with a central tendency of 2 percent to 2.2 percent, just above their estimate s of longer -run normal growth."
 The growth projections for the year as a whole mask some important details about the composition of growth.
" Annual growth will be boosted by the surprisingly strong first quarter, which had just been reported at the time of  the May FOMC meeting."
" The more reliable drivers of growth in the June 19, 2019     Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 3 of 22   economy are spending on consumption and business investment."
" In contrast, the limited evidence available at this time suggests that growth in business fixed income has slowed in the second quarter.1  Moreover, manufacturing production has posted declines so far this year."
" After running close to our symmetric 2 percent objective for most of last year, inflation declined in the first quarter."
" Participants broadly see inflation moving back up toward our 2 percent objective, but at a slower pace than had been expected."
" The central tendency for 2019 core inflation, which omits volatile food and energy components , is between 1.7 and 1.8 percent."
" Setting aside short -term fluctuations, Committee participants expressed concerns about the pace of inflation’s return to 2 percent."
" Wages are rising, as noted above, but not at a pace that would provide much upward impetus to inflation."
" Moreover, weaker global growth may continue to hold i nflation down around the world."
"We are firmly committed to our symmetric 2 percent inflation objective, and we are well aware that inflation weakness that persists even in a healthy economy could pre cipitate a difficultto-arrest downward  drift in longer -run inflation expectations."
" Because there are no definitive measures of inflation expectations, we must rely on imperfect proxies."
" Market -based measures of inflation compensation have moved down since our May meeting , and some survey -based expectations measures are near the bottom of their historic ranges."
 Combining these                                                  1 Chair Powell intended to say that growth in business fixed investment slowed in the second quarter.
" June 19, 2019     Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 4 of 22   factors with the risks to growth already noted, participants expressed concerns about a more sustained shortfall of inflation."
 This added accommodation would support economic activity and inflat ion’s return to our objective.
" It is important, however, that monetary policy not overreact to any individual data point or short -term swing in sentiment."
" So the Committee had, you know, our usual long discussion of global and domestic economic and financial co nditions and then spent this morning talking about monetary policy."
 But we ’re also looking at global growth.
 It ’s really trade developments and concerns about globa l growth that are on our minds.
" In the meantime, we have incoming data in the United States that ’s been pretty good, particularly for the consumer :  Consumer spending is solid supported by, you know, a healthy job market, high levels of employment, wages going up."
" We do see , though, some areas that we’re looking at , such as , I mentioned, business fixed income.2  So—also , the prolonged shortfall in inflation and perhaps job growth—we don’ t like to look at one job report ."
" And , secondly, on inflation, that was a pretty big drop in expected PCE, yet, you know, without reacting to it, are you not sort of undermining your own credibility in terms of commitment to the 2 percent target?"
  I’ll take th e inflation one first.
"Well , the fact that expected inflation went from 1.8 to—Howard Schneider with Reuters —went from 1.8 to 1.5, it ’s the fact that you ’re not responding to that."
 That ’s the inflation question.
 So let me let me answer the inflation question first.
" We saw that market -based measures of inflation expectations, breakevens , dropped."
" Not only that, the actual forecast for inflation for this  year, among FOMC participants , dropped a couple of tenths."
 So that means a more prolonged shortfall of inflation.
" Let me say , on inflation, it ’s something I ’ve been concerned about for quite a long time."
" In a world where policy rates are going to be closer to the effective lower bound, t hen, just as a general matter, we need to be really strong on 2 percent inflation."
  Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has provided a proposal to revalue the U.S. dollar in order to address concerns about rising trade deficits .
" The U.S. Treasury has responsibility for exchange rate policy , not the Fed, and we don’t comment , in that sense , on the level of the dollar."
" We have the responsibility for maximum employment and stable prices, and we use ou r tools to achieve that."
" In fact, central banks —or, rather , nations , when they get together , routinely adopt a communique that says we will target our domestic , economic , and financial conditions and not our exchange rate in using monetary policy, and that includes the United States, that includes the G20 communique that we adopted 10 days ago."
" June 19, 2019     Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 13 of 22   You know, on one hand, you have str ong overall growth."
" On the other hand, manufacturing numbers were a little bit weaker, you have growth in  jobs but coming in a little weaker, and then you have low inflation."
" But you do see growth in services, so you—this pattern around the world of weak manufacturing but growth in the far larger part of the services economy, which has led to low unemployment, good job creation, rising wages, that’s kind of t he two big pieces of it that you see."
 If you lay the crosscurrents on top of that —concerns about global growth and trade developments —you have the full picture.
 Have you modeled the additional growth and inflation you might get from a rate cut?
" Well, we have the tools we have , and we’re committed and sworn to use them to support economic activity ."
 And they do support economic activity through a number of channels that are reasonably well understood— some more directly tied to interest rates than others.
 But we do generally believe that —that our interest rate policy can support demand and support business investment as well.
" You know, we don’t —we react to anything in princ iple that could undermine our achievement of our dual -mandate goals —maximum employment, stable prices —is worthy of our attention and can call forth a policy response."
"  And also, do you think that you and the President have the same goals when it comes to monetary policy?"
" So, essentially, not too concerned about, you know, the central banks no longer being able to carry out monetary policy because of cryptocurrencies or digital currencies."
 I want to take you back to Chicago and the review of your monetary policy strategy.
" And something interesting, I think, is developing , is that outside experts are excited and  are—like the idea of the Fed shifting your inflation target up to 4 percent —around there , roughly , I guess."
" They think that that would, you know, help monetary policy , and that there ’s no—2 percent is not , like , sanctimonious or anything , or whatever , sacred."
  We have—we’ve said that we wouldn’ t look at raising the tar get rate for inflation.
" And they were —there, I think, people were quite struck by their intervention, which was really uniformly around how important maximum  employment is June 19, 2019     Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 18 of 22   and what it means in their communities."
" What they have had is low unemployment, lots of social problems."
" But even those two panels that you just referenced, the people that spoke, they—when they were asked about, you know, 2 percent inflation or higher inflation, they kind of shrugged their shoulders, you know?"
 So—is 4 percent inflation radical ?
 I think you see disinflationary pressures around the world.
 You see central banks having a hard time getting inflation up to their —close to their objective.
" We ’ve done better than other large central banks that are not, you know, open e conomies , like the U.K., where you have big currency moves that move inflation around."
" So—but it ’s quite challenging to get inflation —it’s been —even with very high level s of resource utilization, inflation has been lingering and not getting back up to tar get in  a sustained , symmetric kind of a way."
" So the statement noted that the labor market still remains strong , but the May jobs report  that that we saw missed on estimates , but employment rates still stayed at 3.6 percent."
 I ’m wondering how you reconcile that with the fact that we only got 3.1 percent yearover-year wage growth in that report.
" What does that tell you about employment, and by all standards compared to, say , a month ago or a year ago, are we closer or farther away from full employment or maximum employment?"
 The unemployment rate is lower.
" So the level of wages is very consistent with what it should be , in the  sense that it ’s approximately equal to inflation plus productivity increases on an hourly basis."
" So what ’s, I guess , a little surprising , though, is that you could reach these levels of unemployment late —you know, long into a cycle, let’s say , and not see even higher wages  that are pushing up on inflation, because wages at this level, even though they ’re growing at a healthy rate, at an appropriate rate, they ’re not growing at a rate that would provide much upward thrust for inflation."
 You haven’ t seen real signals that we’re at maximum employment.
