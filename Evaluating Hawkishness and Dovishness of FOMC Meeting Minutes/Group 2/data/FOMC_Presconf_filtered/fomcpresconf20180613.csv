" But because monetary policy affects everyone, I want to start with a plain -English summary of how the economy is doing, what my colleagues and I at the Federal Rese rve are trying to do, and why."
" Most people who want to find jobs are finding them, and unemployment and inflation are low."
 Interest rates have been low for some years while the economy has been recovering from the financial crisis.
" For the past few years, we have been gradually raising interest rates, and along the way we’ve tried to explain the reasoning behind our decisions."
" In particular, we think that gradually returning interest rates to a more normal level as the economy strengthens is the best way the Fed can help s ustain an environment in which American households and businesses can thrive."
" We don’t put our interest rate decisions on hold or on autopilot, because the economy can always evolve in unexpected ways."
 History has shown that moving interest rates either too quickly or too slowly can lead to bad economic outcomes.
 I want to point out that having twice as many press conferences does not signal anything about the timing or pace of future interest rate changes.
" Economic growth appears to have picked up in the current quarter, largely reflecting a bounceback in household spending."
" Business investment continues to grow strongly, and the overall outlook for growth remains favorable."
" The median projection for the growth of real GDP is 2.8 percent this year, 2.4 percent next year, and 2  percent in 2020."
" Compared with the projections made in March, this median growth path is little changed."
" The unemployment rate declined over the past two months and stood at 3.8 percent in May, its lowest level in nearly two decades."
 And we expect the job market to remain strong.
" As you can see in our Summary of Economic Projections, the median of Committee participants’ projections for the unemployment rate stands at 3.6  percent in the fourth quarter of this year and runs at 3.5 percent over the next two years, a percentage point below the median estimate of its lon gerrun normal rate."
" After many years of running below our 2  percent longerrun objective, inflation has recently moved close to that level."
" The core PCE index, which excludes prices of energy and food and tends to be a better indicator of future inflation, rose 1.8 percent over the same period."
" As we had expected, inflation moved up as the unusually low readings from last March dropped out of the calculation."
" The recent inflation data have been encouraging, but after many years of inflation below our objective, we do not want to declare victory."
 We want to ensure that inflation remains near our symmetric 2  percent longerrun goal on a sustained basis.
" As we note in our Statement of Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, the Committee would be concerned if inflation were running persistently above or below our 2 percent objective."
" Of course, many factors affect inflation —some temporary and others more lasting—and at any given time inflation may be above or below 2 percent."
" For example, the recent rise in oil prices will likely pu sh inflation somewhat above 2 percent in coming months."
" But that transitory development should have little, if any, consequence for inflation over the next few years."
 The median of participants’ projections for inflation runs at 2.1 percent through 2020.
" Relative to the March projections, the median inflation projection is a little higher this year and next."
" June 13, 2018 Chairman Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 4 of 26  As I mentioned, today we took another step in gradually scaling back monetary policy accommodation by raising the target range for the federal funds  rate by ¼  percentage point, bringing it to 1¾  to 2 percent."
" We continue to believe that a gradual approach for increasing the federal funds rate will best promote a sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near our symmetric 2  percent goal."
" We are aware that raising rates too slowly might raise t he risk that monetary policy would need to tighten abruptly down the road in response to an unexpectedly sharp increase in inflation or financial excesses, jeopardizing the economic expansion."
" Conversely, if we raise interest rates too rapidly, the econom y could weaken , and inflation could continue to run persistently below our objective."
" As we have said, changing the target range for the federal funds rate is our prim ary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy."
" And, finally, as discussed in the minutes of our May meeting, we’re making a small technical adjustment in one of our tools for implementing monetary policy."
" In recent months, the federal funds rate has moved up toward the IOER rate as shortterm interest rates have risen more generally."
 I have a question about inflation and a question about growth.
" On inflation, I’m curious if there’ s anything that’s happened since March that has changed your assessment of the risk of inflation increases beyond what you forecast in the year to come."
" And , on growth, you m entioned fiscal June 13, 2018 Chairman Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 6 of 26  policy is adding to growth, and I’m curious if you could break that down a li ttle bit further for us and say—what effects do you think the recent tax cuts are having on growth?"
 So since—I wouldn’ t say anything has h appened since March to really change the way I ’m thinking about inflation or the way the Committee ’s thinking about inflation.
 We’ve seen inflation move very gradually up toward our 2 percent objective.
" And part of that has been just idiosyncratic things dropping out from last March, which were holding inflation—measured inflation —down."
 Part of it is just that continued tightening in the labor market and the economy more broadly is pushing inflation up.
" But I can say that the Committee members —Committee participants —generally believe that the fiscal changes —and that includes both the tax cuts, individual and corporate, and the spending changes—will provide meaningful support to demand, significant support to demand over the course of the next three years."
 That should drive productivity.
" So the Fed is about four interest rate increases , using the projections released today, away from what might be considered a neutral fed funds rate."
" So for many, many years, we’ ve been far from maximum employment and stable prices, and so the need for accommodative policy has been —has been clear."
" As the economy has strengthened and as we’ ve gradually raised interest rates, the question comes into view of, how much longer will you need to be accommodative?"
 Neutral meaning that interest rates are neither pushing the economy up nor trying to restrain it.
" So I think we’ll be very carefully looking at incoming data on inflation, on financial readings, and on the labor market."
" We have to acknowledge that there are always wide uncertainty bands around the level of, for example, the natural rate of unemployment."
" You know, the—our target for —our mediumterm objective for inflation is 2  percent PCE inflation."
" You know, there are some ideas that sort of take cognizance of the fact that rates are lower , we’ re near the zero lower bound, and that could put downward pressure on inflation expectations if we’ re going to be down at the  zero  lower bound and, therefore, sort of undermine the credibility of the 2 percent inflation objective."
" I ought to star t by saying that, you know, Congress has assigned us very important jobs and—you know, maximum employment, stable prices , we have a role in financial stability that we share with other agencies."
 Growth is strong.
" Mr. Chairman, you said there’ s a difference of opinion among economists, but looking at the longerrun GDP growth rates for the members of the Committee, there ’s not a whole lot of difference."
" Is that showing us that not a single member of the Committee—including yourself, Mr. Chairman—agrees with economists over at the White House that they can achieve long -run sustained growth rates above or at 3 percent or higher?"
" But I think our approach is going to be to watch and see and hope that, in fact, we do get significant effects to, you know, to potential growth out of the tax bill, and we’ re just going to have to see."
 You said earlier that it’ s still a little too early to declare victory on inflation.
 I wanted to circle back on a question that was asked at the initial press conference about what—what  does the Fed say  in regards to the inflation target as symmetric ?
" And now that you’re planning to hold these regular press conferences, starting next year, how do you explain —how do you plan to explain that to the American people that inflation is not overrunning?"
" You know, what we ’ve said in our Statement of LongerRun Principles  and Monetary Policy Strategy is that the Committee would be concerned if inflation were to run persistently above or below 2 percent, persistently above or below 2 percent."
 We know that inflation is going to bounce around.
" For example, as I mentioned, later this summer there ’s a good chance that headline inflation will move up above June 13, 2018 Chairman Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 11 of 26  2 percent because of oil prices."
" Things buffet inflation back and forth, but—so we acknowledge that, we understand that—and if inflation were to persistently run above or below 2 percent, then we would be using our tools to try to move inflation back in the direction of the target."
" We do understand, though, that we don’ t have the ability to precisely hit that target, so we expect that inflation will be above or below."
 We— unemployment was 10 percent at the height of the crisis.
" Growth is strong, labor markets are strong, inflation is close to target, and that’ s what you’re seeing."
" For many years, as I mentioned —many years —we had inter est rates held low to support economic activity."
" Are we finally going to see that June 13, 2018 Chairman Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 12 of 26  wage growth pickup this year?"
" I know you’ re forecasting a little bit more inflation, but is that going to translate through to wage growth?"
" Part of that can be explained by low productivity, which is something we’ ve talked about at the Committee and elsewhere."
"And, frankly, I do think there’s a lot to like about low unemployment."
" Our role, though, is also to, you know, to make sure that—that maximum employment happens in a context of price stability and financial stability, which is why we ’re gradually raising rates."
" On both inflation and unemployment, the new projections—for unemployment lower than before and inflation higher."
 You ment ioned that unemployment moved down and  inflation moved up by truly small amounts.
" And you asked, you know—I mean, I think we ta ke a longer -run view that we’re shooting for— we’re aiming for —2 percent inflation —inflation around 2 percent."
" We’ re not going to—we didn’t overreact, I think, to inflation being under 2 percent."
" And I think we’ll always be using our tools to move inflation in the direction of the target, if it—if it leaves —if it moves away from the target persistently, as I mentioned."
"In terms of unemployment, you know, you have to acknowledge that we are—no one really knows with certainty what the level of the natural rate of unemployment is, the rate that is sustainable over a long period of time."
 Older and more educated people have lower unemployment rates.
" And as I mentioned, I think at the last press conference, estimates by the—by members of the Committee have moved down by a full percentage point since maybe 2012 as we’ ve learned —as unemployment has dropped and inflation hasn’ t really reacted."
 We’re not waiting for inflation to show up.
 One would be moving too quickly—inflation never gets back to target  if we do that.
" And the other is moving too slowly, and then we have—we have too much inflation or financial instability, and we have to raise quickly."
" Are we seeing a— with the fiscal policy —a fundamental shift in the economy, where we have lower natural unemployment, also possibly a lower rate of natural unemployment and lower inflation?"
" Your question—your first question, really, is, do we think the natural rate of unemployment is lower?"
" We don’t think that the natural rate of unemployment—you know, it’s not one of those variables that moves around a lot."
" But, you know, the thing is, if you look back, there have been a lot of studies done and, you know, realtime estimates of the natural rate of unemployment have uncertainty bands, which a re—which are quite wide, so we have to remember that and very much be guided by the—by the incoming data."
 You asked about inflation.
" You know, inflation we look about—we look at the 2 percent inflation objective as something that central banks, the Fed , really  control."
" I think in—in recent years the dominant force has been, you know, disinflationary—have been pushing down on inflation."
 Inflation was too high and central banks were constantly pushing down.
" It’ s really important that inflation not fall below 2  percent , that inflation expectations remain well anchore d at 2 percent —very important—because the implications of inflation below 2  percent are that you’re closer to the zero lower bound, meaning the Fed has less room to cut, meaning that we’ ll spend more time there and we won ’t be able to do the job that we’ re assigned to do for our citizens."
 You guys moved the median unemployment forecast for 2020 down to 3.5 percent but left the longerrun at 4.5 percent today.
 How are you going to get unemployment from 3.5 percent up to that 4.5 percent rate?
" First, we’ re learning about the real location of the natural rate of unemployment as we go."
" If you—if you look at the forecast, two years from now, end of 2020, you’ re still seeing inflation very close to target."
" So there’s no sense that inflation will—no sense in our models, or in our projections, or forecasts—that inflation will take off or move unexpectedly  quickly from these levels, even if unemployment does remain low."
 So that’s—that ’s what —so it’ s important to know that the—the unemployment rate forecasts go with the inflation forecasts and go with the rate forecasts.
" And so each person who’ s submitting  them is submitting accommodate —you know, appropriate monetary policy that fits with that person’s assessment."
" And their June 13, 2018 Chairman Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 17 of 26  assessments generally are to support maximum employment and stable prices around 2 percent."
" So if we thought that inflation were going to take off, obviously, we’d be showing higher rates, but that’s not what we think will happen."
" Then why, I guess, would the longerrun unemployment rate not be a little bit lower and closer to that 2020 number?"
" And so, okay, I wanted to know what you would say to workers who are worried that, you know, these paths of rate hikes that you’ve laid out will kind of undercut the wage growth they are just starting to see."
" If you ask —if you survey workers about the job market, they’ ll say that it’s a really good June 13, 2018 Chairman Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 20 of 26  environment to find jobs."
" And so what we’ re doing is, we are trying to conduct monetary policy in a way that will sustain that expansion, keep the labor markets strong, and keep inflation above—right at—sorry, not above, but right at 2 percent."
 Where do you see the neutral interest rate is right now?
" So if—you know, if inflation stays around 2, it doesn’t go above 2 for a while, do you see a need to actually exceed that neutral point?"
" I mean , there’s—there should be an effect if you have increased deficits that should put upward pressure on, you know, a few tenths, let’s say."
" Well, I think you have to look at inflation."
" You’ve got to look at— you’ve got to look at all of the indicators in the economy and look at inflation, look at unemployment, look at what ’s happening in the job market."
 It ’s worth noting that the last two business cycles didn’ t end with high inflation —they ended with financial instability —so that’s something we need to also keep our eye on.
 Have you talked during the meeting about when the Fed is going to remove or change the word “accommodative” that describe the monetary policy for almost 10  years?
" And, you know, as I mentioned earlier, for a long time, the economy has  needed accommodative monetary policy."
" As the economy has recovered, we’ ve been gradually raising rates and we will —we will be at a place relatively soon when, again, assuming we stay on this path, when interest rates will be in the zone of what FOMC participants think is roughly neutral."
" We have very important jobs assigned to us by Congress and that’ s maximum employment, stable prices, financial stability."
 And what does it say about the inflation outlook as well?
" So if you look at households, you do not see excess credit growth , you don’ t see high levels of credit going out."
" Chair Powell, you referenced a minute ago this idea of cushion, or the fact that the Fed doesn’ t have as much of when rates are low and inflation is low."
" And I’m wondering if you or the Committee has thought about your move to raise interest rates as partly responding to the economy, but partly giving yourselves room to navigate in the inevitable future recession, whenever that was to come."
" And so I think it’s more just—we ’re just looking at the economy, and what does it need, and how do we—how do we sustain the expansion, keep the labor market strong, and try to keep inflation near 2 percent?"
 You talked earlier about wage growth and your basic message to workers.
 The part that we focus on is maximum employment.
" So we view maximum employment as the maximum sustainable level of employment, meaning it ’s not so much that it will cause the economy to overheat."
