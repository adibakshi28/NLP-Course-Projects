" At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed to achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us —maximum employment and price stability."
 Today my colleagues on the FOMC and I reaffirmed our strong forward guidance for interest rates and also provided additional guidance for our asset purchases.
" Together, thes e measures will ensure that monetary policy will continue to deliver powerful support to the economy until the recovery is complete."
 Economic activity has continued to recover from its depressed second -quarter level.
" The  overall rebound in household spending owes in part to federa l stimulus payments and expanded unemployment benefits, which provided essential support to many families and individuals."
" The housing sector has fully recovered from the downturn, supported in part by low mortgage interest rates."
" The recovery has progressed more quickly than generally expected, and forecasts from FOMC participants for economic growth this year have been revised up since our September Summary of Economic Projections."
" As with overall economic activity, the pace of improvement in the labor market has moderated."
" Job growth slowed to 245,000 in November, and while t he unemployment rate has continued to decline, it  remain s elevated at 6.7  percent."
" Looking ahead, FOMC participants project the un employment rate to continue to decline; the median projection is 5 percent at the end of next year and  moves below 4 percent by 2023."
 The pandemic has also left a significant imprint on inflation.
" Overall, on a 12month basis, inflation remains below our 2 percent longer -run objective."
 The median inflation projection from FOMC participants rises from 1.2 percent this year to 1.8 percent next year and reaches 2 percent in 2023.
" While a little more than half of participants now judge risks to be broadly balanced for economic activity, a similar number continue to see risks weighted to the downside for inflation."
" The Fed’s response to this crisis has been guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to promote the stability of the financial system."
" As noted in our Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, we view maximum employment as a broadbased and inclusive goal."
 Our ability to achieve maximum employment in the years ahead depends importantly on having longer -term inflation expectations well anch ored at 2 percent.
" As we reiterated in today’s statement, with inflation running persistently below 2 percent, we will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and December 16, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 4 of 30  longer -term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2  percent."
 We expect to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these employment and inflation outcomes are achieved .
" With regard to interest rates, we continue to expect it will be appropriate to  maintain the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessment of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderate ly exceed 2 percent for some time."
" In addition, as we noted in today’s policy statement, we will continue to increase our holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency mortgage -backed securities by at least $40 billion per  month until substantial further progress has been made toward our  maximum -employment and price -stability goals ."
" Combined with our forward guidance for the federal funds rate, our enhanced balance sheet guidance will ensure that the stance of monetary policy remains highly accommodative as the recovery progresses."
 Our guidance is outcome  based and is tied to  progress toward reaching our employment and inflation goals.
" Overall, our interest rate and balance sheet tools are providing powerful support to the economy and will continue to do so."
" It will take a while to get back to the levels  of economic activity and employment that prevailed at the beginning of this year, and it may take continued support from both monetary and fiscal policy to achieve that."
" We have —unemployment now is at 6.7 , the SEP median sees, sees it falling to 5."
" Headline inflation is one time 1.2, t he SEP median sees it rising to 1.8 ."
" And core inflation is 1.4 , and the SEP sees it rising to 1.8 likewise."
 Would that constitute “ substantial further progress ” toward the C ommittee ’s maximum -employment and price -stability goals?
" And, really, the overarching message, Rich, is that our guidance for both interest rates and asset purchases will keep monetary policy accommodative until our maximum -employment and price -stability goals are achieved , and that’s, that’s  a powerful message."
 It means we’ll be looking for employment to be substantially closer to assessments of its maximum level and inflation to be substantially closer to our 2 percent  longer -run goal before we start making adjustments to our purchases.
" How much concern do you have in terms of , where could employment go?"
" But with the December 16, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 11 of 30  expiration of unemployment benefits —some of the unemployment benefits, the expiration of eviction moratoriums with the virus spreading the way it is , there ’s a need for households and businesses to have , have  fiscal support."
" We have , and others too, have consistently expected there to be more economic—that , that cases would hold— growth in cases would hold back the economy more than it actually has."
 You see very high demand.
 That’s just reflective of a lot of demand.
" There ’s also a sense that this—some of this may be pentup demand from when the economy was closed, which would imply that demand—once that demand is met, that the real level of demand will be more manageable."
" We ’ve talked about the retail sales numbers are a little bit sluggish this month, the unemployment, the job growth has slowed down."
"So I would—I would say , though, that in the near term, the help that people need isn’ t just from low interest rates that stimulates demand over time and works with long and variable lags."
" And, secondly, if you could, please connect with me the lack of movement on the decision to maintain th e current pace and quantities of  bond purchases with the fact that the SEPs  are showing three years with inflation not reaching 2 percent ."
"In terms of the , you know, inflation, a couple things —your second question."
" You know, we’re —I think you have to be honest with yourself about , about  inflation these days."
" There are—there are  significant disinflationary pressures around the world, and there ha ve been for a while , and they persist today."
" It’s, is  not going to be easy to have inflation move up."
 It took a l ong time to get inflation back to 2 percent  in the last crisis.
" December 16, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 16 of 30  And, you know, we ’re, we’re  honest with ourselves and with you in the SEP that even with the very high level of accommodation that we ’re providing both through low rates and very high levels o f asset purchases, it will take some time, because that ’s what we believe the underlying inflation dynamics are in our economy."
 And that ’s sort of why we ’re—one reason why we ’re concerned about inflation is that we see that.
" And , and that ’s why we have a dopted the flexible average inflation -targeting framework."
" And, you know, we ’ve been having very long expansions since— in, in the last several decades because inflation has not —really , the old model was , inflation would come along and the Fed  would tighten, and we ’d have a recession."
" Now inflation has been low, and we haven’ t had that dynamic."
 And we ’re not going to preemptively raise rates until we see inflation actually reaching 2  percent  and being on track to exceed 2 percent .
" If you look at what —at inflation  compensation and at the survey measures of , of when the Fed will lift off , everything has moved."
 But how do you see that also potentially affecting monetary policy?
" But  leaving that specific case aside, I mean, are there— is there any way that climate change considerations could affect monetary policy going forward?"
You asked about monetary policy.
 So you asked about monetary policy.
" Monetary policy, maximum employment, stable prices —it’ s less obvious to me."
" And I ’m just curious if you can give some detail about the damage that these budget deficits or the lack of aid s pecifically to state and local governments will have on the recovery  and, specifically , with the m unicipal l ending f acility set to expire, what more the Fed  might be able to do to fill that specific hole."
" And so far, since the pandemic began, employment has December 16, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 21 of 30  dropped by 1.3 million in—of  state and local government."
" The parts that are not performing well are not struggling from high December 16, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 22 of 30  interest rates."
" But also, I would remind —I would  also note , though, monetary policy works with “ long and variable lags, ” is the famous statement."
"  So we think that the big effects from monetary policy are, you know, months and months into the future."
" Again, what we ’ve—what we’ve  done is , we’ve laid out a path whereby we’re going to keep monetary policy highly accommodative for a long time, really until —really until we reach very close to our goals, which is not, you know , not really the way it ’s been done in the past."
 We think it ’s suffering from the pandemic and people wanting to not engage in certain kinds of economic activity.
" Some forecasters have suggested that there is  a lot of pent -up demand for travel and entertainment and, and services and the like that might stop being pent up in a hurry if we do get to a point where the vaccine is widely distributed, a nd that the beaten -down service sector might have trouble meeting that demand in, in a hurry."
" How might that affect inflation , in your mind?"
" But what inflation is, is a process whereby they go up year upon year  upon year upon year."
" And if —given the inflation dynamics that we ’ve had over the last several decades, just a single, single  sort of price -level increase has not resulted in ongoing price -level increases."
" One, when unemployment went down and resources got tight, prices started going up."
 So  that was the inflation —those are the inflation dynamics of that era.
 The re—the  connection between low unemployment or other resource utilization and inflation is so much weaker than it was.
" And  the persistence of inflation, if you—if you get a —for example, oil prices go up, a nd that ’ll send a temporary shock through the economy."
" The persistence of that into , into inflation over time is  just not there."
" But I would—I would expect , though, going in that that would be a onetime price increase rather than an increase in underlying inflation that would be persistent."
" Right now we ’re buying assets because it ’s a— you know, it ’s a—it’s a  time when the economy needs highly accommodative monetary policy, and we think our asset purchases are, you know, one of the main delivery mechanisms for that, the size of the balance sheet."
" You know, there ’s lots of demand for , for U.S. Treasury paper all —from all over the world."
" And so we , we contribute to that through highly accommodative monetary policy, through accommodative financial conditions that are supporting economic activit y."
 This year ’s budget deficit is $3.1 trillion.
 At what point do deficits and the debt start to have an impact on the economy or on interest rates?
" F or my way of thinking and many others ’, the time to focus on that is when the economy is strong and when unemployment is low and taxes are —you know, are , are pouring in, and there ’s, there’s room to get on—get on a sustainable path, because the economy ’s really doing well."
" In particular, you can look at the real interest rate payments, the amount of , what does it cost?"
" And from that standpoint, if you—if you sort of take real interest costs of the federal deficit and divide that by GDP, we ’re actually —you know , we’re actually on a more sustainable fiscal path if you look at it through those eyes."
" Well, the  argument for continuing to spend is that low interest rates make it affordable."
  Do you worry you get  in a situation where you would have congressional interference in monetary policymaking or at least feel significant political pressure to keep rates low because the country can ’t afford to pay a significant interest bill?
" I think, you know, if we—if we  do our jobs well and support the economy and achieve maximum employment and stable prices, keep the financial system stable, I don ’t think that that is something that will—that I would worry about, certainly not in the near term."
