 My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.
" We understand the hardship that high inflation is causing, and we remain strongly committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal."
" Since early l ast year, the FOMC has significantly tightened  the stance of monetary policy."
" Today we took another step by raising our policy interest rate ¼ percentage point, and we are continuing to reduce our securities holdings at a brisk pace."
 I ’ll have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments.
 Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a mode rate pace.
 Growth in consumer spending appears to have slowed from earlier in the year.
 And higher interest rates and slower output growth also appear to be weighing on business fixed investment.
 The unemployment rate remains low at 3.6 percent.
" There are some continuing s igns that supply and July 26, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  Page 2 of 28  demand in the labor market are coming into better balance."
" Nominal wage growth has shown some signs of easing, and job vacancies have declined so far this year."
" While the jobsto-workers gap has narrowed, labor demand still substantially exceeds the supply of available workers."
 Inflation remains well above our longerrun goal of 2 percent.
 Inflation has moderated somewhat since the middle of last year.
" Nonetheless, the process of getting inflation back down to 2 percent has a long way to go."
" Despite elevated inflation, longerterm inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets."
 The Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the A merican people.
" My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant —significant hardship, as it erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportatio n."
" We’re highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective."
" We have been seeing the effects of our policy tightening on demand in the most interest  rate–sensitive sectors of the economy, particularly housing and investment."
" It will take time, howeve r, for the full effects of our ongoing monetary restraint to be realized, especially on inflation."
" In addition, t he economy is facing headwinds from tighter credit conditions  for households and businesses, which are likely to weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation."
"In determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2  percent over time, the Committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary  policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments."
" We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting, based on the totality of the incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation , as well as the balance of risks."
 We remain committed to bring ing inflation back to our 2 percent goal and to keeping longer -term inflation expectations well anchored.
 Reducing inflation is likely to require a period of below -trend growth and some softening of labor market conditions.
 Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer  run.
 We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum -employment and price -stability goals.
" But we ’re going to be assessing the need for further tightening that may be appropriate —you read the language—“ to return inflation to 2 percent over time.”  I would say that the intermeeting data came in broadly in line with expectations :  Economic activity remained resilient, job creation remains strong while cooling a bit, and the June CPI report actually came in a bit better than expectations for a change."
" We hope that inflation will follow a lower path , as was—that will be consistent with the CPI reading, but we don’t know that , and we ’re just going to need to see more data."
" Really , it will be the broader, the whole broader picture, and starting with —we ’re looking for moderate growth, right?"
" We ’re looking for supply and demand through the economy coming into better balance , including, in parti cular , in the labor market."
 We’ ll be looking at inflation.
 I think we have an ECI report coming later this week —which is [an] employment compensation index—and lots of data on economic activity.
" Monetary policy, we believe, is restrictive and is putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation."
" Many forecasts call for, for rates —for , for inflation to remain low, but we just don’ t know that until we see the data."
" Obviously, you updated the language around growth in the statement today."
" It seems like the American consumers are in pretty good shape,  and it does see m like growth is sort of picking back up a little bit or at least doing well."
" And I wonder , from your perspective , if that continues, if we see growth not just stabilizing but doing, you know, performing well this summer, is that a problem because it’ s inflationary , or is it good news because it suggests that a soft landing is more likely?"
" So I would say it this way:   The overall resilience of the economy, the fact that , that  we’ve been able to achieve disinflation so far without any meaningful negative impact o n the labor market, the strength of the economy —overall, that’ s a good thing."
" A t the margin, stronger growth could lead, over time, to higher inflation, and that would require an appropriate response for monetary policy."
" So if you go back to what we ’re trying to do here, we ’re trying to achieve a stance of policy that ’s sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to 2  percent."
" I mentioned that the inflation report was actually a little better than expected, but , you know, we ’re, we’re  going to be careful about taking too much signal from , from a single reading."
" And, you know, growth came in stronger than expected."
"  Chair Powell, markets widely believe the median FOMC participant ’s inflation forecast from June for  the fourth  quarter of this year will be too high , given autos and shelter , and t hat by S eptember , that may warrant a downward revision in the inflation forecast of 20 to 30 basis points."
" Would that type of inflation progress be enough to hold rates steady from here, or do you need to see below -trend growth and decelerating labor income growt h to be convinced that you ’ve done enough?"
 We’ ll be looking at the growth data.
" It ’s the totality of the data, I think , but with a particular focus on, on making progress on inflation."
" So consumer confidence in the economy is rising, likely in large part becaus e of, of the declines in headline inflation ."
" How much are Americans truly harmed by inflation at its current level, headline level of 3 percent ?"
" And with that  in mind, when do you put some weight back on the employment side of the dual mandate?"
" So I guess I ’d say it this way :  First, it is —it is  a good thing that headline inflation has come down so much, because that ’s really what the public experiences ."
" And, and I would say that having headline inflation move down that much almost creates a —it will strengthen the broad sense that , that  the publ ic has that inflation is coming down, which will in turn, we hope, help inflation continue to move down."
" Well, I mean , you ’ve talked for many press conferences now about the harm created by inflation, how hard it is for people."
 So how much of that are we still seeing with inflation now down at 3 [percent]?
" It ’s hard to say exactly whether , whether  they ’re in balance or not, but as our —as our  stance has become more restrictive and inflation moderates, we do increasingly face that risk."
"  But , you know, we , we need to see that inflation is durably down that far, you know ."
"As you know, we think, and most economists think, that core inflation is actually a better signal of , of where headline inflation is going, because headline inflation is affected greatly by volatile energy and food prices ."
" So we would want core inflation to be coming down, because that’s what we think—that ’s—core is sign aling where headline  is going to go in the future."
" And core inflation is still pretty elevated, you know?"
" Well, and then if inflation were to —just a  quick follow [up]: If it stays at 3 or drops even a little bit more, I mean, how much of an increase in unemployment do you think is acceptable to get that last bit of inflation?"
" People are talking about the potential difficulty of the last, so -called last mile of inflation."
" Again, how much unemployment do you think is justified to get down that last  one— CHAIR POWELL."
" So it is —it is  a very positive thing that, actually, the unemployment rate is the same as it was when we lifted off in March of ’22, at 3.6 percent ."
" So that ’s a real blessing in that we ’ve been able to achieve some disinflation, and we don’ t seek to it ."
" It’s not that we ’re aiming to , to raise unemployment, but I would just say, the historical record —we have to be honest about the historical record, which does suggest that when central banks go in and slow the economy to bring down inflation, the result tends to be some softening in labor  market conditions."
" The worst outcome for everyone, of course, would be not to deal with inflation now, not get it done ."
" Whatever the short -term social cost s of getting inflation under control, the longer -term social costs of failing to do so are greater , and the historical record is very, very clear on that."
" If you go through a pe riod where inflation expectations are not anchored, inflation is volatile, it interferes with people ’s lives and with economic activity , and, you know, that ’s the—that’s the  thing we , we really need to avoid and will avoid."
" At this point, you say the policy is restrictive , but all year long we have seen growth surprise to the upside, unemployment to the downside, and inflation,  lately, to the downside."
" Do you think you might need to do more , because I ’m curious about what you see as inflation dynamics now ?"
 Is the economy still moving in a direction where it creates more inflation?
" Or is the economy disinflating, and you’ re just, you’ re able to go back to the old F ed policy of opportunistic disinflation?"
" So I ’ll just say again, the broader picture of what we want to see is, we want to see easing of supply constraints and normalization of pandemic -related distortions to demand and supply."
 W e want to see economic growth running at moderate or modest levels to help ease inflationar y pressures.
" W e want to see continued restoration of supply and demand balance, particularly in the labor market."
 A nd all of that should lead to declining inflationary pressures.
" So we intend, again, to keep pol icy restrictive until we ’re confident that inflation is coming down sustainably to our 2 percent target, and we ’re prepared to further tighten if that is appropriate."
" So, among your colleagues, there have been people who’ ve said they feel that very little transmission has taken place so far from monetary policy into the economy, and there are those who feel, they say, it ’s happened very fast this time , and it ’s kind of up to date."
" So the re’s a long -running debate about the lags between changes in financial conditions and the response to those changes from economic activity and inflation, right?"
" We know that financial conditions affect economic activity and inflation with a lag that can be long and variable, or lags , plural, that can be long and variable —a lot of uncertainty around the length of the lags."
" First, the first thing to say is, we ’re determined to bring inflation down to 2 percent over time , and we will use our tools to do that ."
" If you take the nominal f ederal funds r ate, subtract the mainstream estimate of near -term inflation expectations, you get a real federal funds r ate that is July 26, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 14 of 28   well above most estimates of the longer -term neutral rate."
" So I would say, monetary policy is restrictive, more so after today ’s decision, meaning that it is putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation."
 We ’ll keep monetary policy restrictive  until we think it’ s not appropriate to do so.
 W e are resolutely committed to returning inflation to our 2  percent goal over time.
" Inflation has proved, repeatedly , has proved stronger than we and other forecasts —forecasters have expected , and at some point , that may change."
" The bank lending data really is —the growth rate ’s edging down towards below, heading below zero, which is usually, you know, a recession indicator."
" You’ve got weak demand, and, you know, it , it gives a picture of pretty tight credit conditions in the economy."
" Could you break down the reasons why inflation has fallen and what share of that credit you would give to factors that don’ t stem directly from rate hikes or that might be within your control at all, like easing supply chains and a drop in energy prices over the past year?"
" So  let me start by saying that the inflation surge that we saw in the pandemic resulted from a collision of elevated demand and, and constrained supply, both of which followed from the unprecedented features of the pandemic and the response from fiscal and m onetary policy."
" And we ’ve always expected that the disinflationary process would stem from , both from  the normalization of those broad pandemic -related supply and demand conditions and from restrictive , restrictive  monetary policy , which would help return the balance between supply and demand by restraining demand."
" So to go, break it down a little further :  Of course , headline inflation has come down sharply from elevated levels as energy and food prices have come down, mostly due to [a] reversal of the effects [on those prices that resulted] from the war in Ukraine ."
" For core inflation, I’ d say there also —there has been a role for , for most —for , for both factors, both that I mentioned."
" The combination of an increase in sales and inventories, while , while  vehicle inflation has  decelerated, points to a substantial rol e for supply, but there ’s July 26, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 16 of 28   also a role for demand , as, you know, the loans and things like that are more expensive ."
 Housing services inflation now starts to move down.
" You know, I would say, monetary policy is working about as we expect, and we think—we think  it’ll play an important role going forward, in particular in nonhousing services , where , really, we think that ’s, that’s  where the labor market will come in as a very , very  important factor."
 So we think both of those —both of those  sources of disinflation are playing an important role.
" I think monetary policy is going to be important going forward because we, we’ re sort  of reaping now the benefits of the —of the  reversal of some of the very specific pandemic things."
" We’ re seeing that with goods , in particular, with s upply chains and shortages moving, and we ’re seeing —so I think going forward, monetary policy will be impo rtant, particularly in that, in the sector, in the nonhousing services sector."
" Is that an indication that there ’s a, a  wage inflation pressure?"
 And how do you target pressure on the wage inflation without pushing the economy into a recession?
" So, wage inflation."
" Like , how do you—how do you target wage inflation without pushing an economy into a recession?"
 I don’t —I don ’t think we ’re targeting wage inflation.
 T hey’re still at levels what would—that would be consistent over a long period of time with 2 percent inflation.
" And by so many indicators, labor market demand is cooling."
" So that ’s actually not a bad thing, in a sense, because if , if what we see is a labor market, very strong demand for labor, which is really the engine of the economy—p eople are getting hired, many people going back to work, getting wages, spending money—and that ’s really what ’s driving the economy but  that i t’s gradually slowing, it ’s gradually cooling, that ’s a good prescription for getting where we want to get."
" Are you concerned  then about a trend of series of big unions, these contract s, pushing wage inflation then?"
" And so I ’m wondering, is the level of inflation what ’s sort of important there as you think about getting to 2 percent  and when you might start cutting rates, or is the speed at which inflation is falling also important?"
" And when , when people  are writing  dow n rate cuts next year, you know, it just is a sense that inflation is coming down , and we ’re comfortable that it’ s coming down, and it ’s time to start cutting rates."
" And that ’s just going to be a judgment that we have to make then, a full year from now , July 26, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 19 of 28   and it ’ll be about how confident we are that inflation is , in fact, coming down to our 2 percent goal."
" So it’s, it has been my view consistently that we do have a shot, and my base case is that we will be able to achieve inflation moving back down to our target without the kind of really significant downturn that results in high levels of job losses that we ’ve seen in some past —in some past  instances, many past instances of tightening that look like ours."
"So the staff now has a noticeable slowdown in growth starting later this year in the forecast, but given the resilience of the economy recently, they are no longer fore casting a recession."
 And is the reason for optimism that inflation has come down and you still have a strong labor market?
" We’ ve, we’ve  seen so far the beginnings of disinflation without any real costs in the labor market."
" We’ve seen softening through other —not through unemployment, not through higher unemployment ."
" You and other Fed  officials in the past have suggested that you don’ t need to keep hiking until inflation hits 2 percent, that —as long as you see continued progress."
" So I ’m wondering, how close do you need to get with the inflation numbers coming down?"
 So the idea that we would keep hiking until inflation gets to 2 percent —it would be a prescription [for a policy] of going way past the target.
"So if we see inflation coming down credibly, sustainably, then we don’ t need to be at a restrictive level anymore ."
 We’d really want to be sure that inflation is coming down in a sustainable level.
" Bu t that’ s the way I would think about it, is you ’d start—you’ d stop raising long before you got to 2 percent inflation , and you’ d start cutting before you got to 2 percent inflation , too, because we don’ t see ourselves getting to 2  percent inflation until—you know, all the way back to 2—until 2025 or so."
" That process is ongoing, and that w ill restrain economic growth."
" And that ’s, that’s  going to restrain economic activity ."
 It is restraining economic activity.
 So I think we —that goes —that ’s—an expected result of tightening interest rate policy is that—is th at bank credit conditions —bank lending conditions would tighten as well.
" We’ re seeing a strong economy, and it ’s made us confident that we can go ahead and raise interest rates now for the third time since the March events."
" I wondered on wages if you were at all concerned about any inflationary impact of wages now outpacing inflation, which is likely contributing to the boost in consumer sentiment and the continued strength of the consumer that we ’ve been seeing."
" Well, [growth in nominal] wages in excess of inflation means [that increases in] real wages are positive."
" B ut we want wages to be going up at a level that ’s consistent with , with  2 percent inflation over time."
" We don’ t really think that, that  wages were an important cause of inflation in the first year or so of the outbreak."
" Labor market conditions broadly a re going to be an important part of , of getting inflation back down, and that ’s why we think we need some further softening in labor market conditions."
" This goes sort of to the balance of risks question, but you mentioned at the start how  you’ re keeping an eye on consumer activity and whether there might be some sort of a rebound there, and I ’m curious what the Fed ’s explanation would be to families if further interest rate hikes start to hit the labor market—start to , you know, drive that sentiment back down."
" Well, you know, we have a job assigned to us by Congress to get inflation under control."
" And we think the , the single most important thing we can do to benefit those very families, especially families at the lower end of the income spectrum, is to get inflation sustainably under control and restore price stability."
" And I would just point out that the people who are the most hurt by inflation right away are people who are on a low fixed income, who, you know, when you’ re talking about travel or, you know, transportation costs, heating costs, clothing, food, things like that, those —if you’ re just making it through each month on your paycheck and prices go up, you’ re in trouble right away."
 Even middle -class people have some resources and can absorb inflation .
 What does that mean for the Fed  and being sure that inflation will come down to target?
" You know, we will —we ’re going to use our policy tools to —working through financial conditions —to get inflation under control  The implication is, you know, we will do what it takes to get inflation down, and in principle, that , that  could mean that if financial conditions get looser, we have to do more."
" And, you know, really, the active tool of monetary policy is rates."
" Just wondering, how could that contribute to higher food prices and inflation generally, a nd how closely are you watching that?"
" And the moves that we ’ve seen so far, I would say, are not expected to make a significant contribution to U.S. inflation."
