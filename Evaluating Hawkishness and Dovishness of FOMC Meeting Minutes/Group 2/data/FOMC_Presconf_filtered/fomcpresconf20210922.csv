" At the Federal  Reserve, we are strongly committed  to achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us:  maximum employment and price stability."
" Today, the Federal Open Market Committee kept interest rates near zero  and maintained  our current pace of asset purchases."
" These measures, along w ith our strong guidance on interest rates and on our balance sheet, will ensure that monetary policy will continue to support the economy until the recovery is complete."
 I ndicators of economic activity and employment have continued to strengthen.
" Real GDP rose at a robust 6.4 percent pace in the first half of the year, and growth is widely expected to continue at a strong pace in the second half."
" Partly reflecting the effects of the virus and supply constraints, f orecasts from FOMC participants for economic growth this year have been revised somewhat lower s ince o ur June Summary of Economic Projections , but participants still foresee rapid growth."
" September 22, 2021 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 2 of 27   As with overall economic activity, conditions in the labor market have  continued to improve."
" Demand for labor is very strong, and job gains averaged 750,000 per month over the past three months."
" The unemployment rate was 5.2 percent in August, and this figure underst ates the shortfall in employment, particularly as participation in the labor market has not moved up from the low rates that have prevailed for most of the past year."
"  Factors related to the pandemic, such as caregiving needs and ongoing fears of the virus, appear to be weighing on employment growth."
" These factors should diminish with progress on containing the virus, leading to more rapid gains in employment."
" Looking ahead, FOMC participants project the labor market to continue to improve, with the median projection for the unemployment rate standing at 4.8 percent at the end of this year and 3.5 percent in 2023 and ’ 24."
 Inflation is elevated and will likely remain so in coming months before moderating.
" These bottleneck effects have been larger and longer  lasting than anticipated, leading to upward revisions to participants ’ inflation projections for this year."
" Wh ile these supply effects are prominent for now, they will abate, and as they do, inflation September 22, 2021 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 3 of 27   is expected to drop back toward our longer -run goal ."
 The median inflation projection from FOMC participants falls from 4.2 percent this year to 2.2 percent next yea r.
" As the reopening continues, bottlenecks, hiring difficulties, and other constraints could again prove to be greater and longer  lasting than antic ipated, posing upside risks to inflation ."
" Our framework for monetary policy emphasizes the importance of having wellanchored inflation expectations, both to foster price stability and to enhance our ability to promote our broadbased and inclusive maximu memployment goal."
 Indicators of longer -term inflation expectations appear broadly consistent with our longer -run inflation goal of 2 percent.
" If sustained higher inflation were to become a serious concern, we would certainly respond and use our tools to assure that inflation runs at levels that are consistent with our goal."
"The Fed ’s policy actions have been guided by our manda te to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to promote the stability of the financial system."
  We continue  to expect that it will be appropriate to maintain the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate until labor market condi tions have reached levels consistent with the Committee ’s assessment of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.
" More important than any forecast is the September 22, 2021 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 5 of 27   fact that policy will remain accommodative  until we have achieved our maximum -employment and price -stability goals."
" When it comes to the taper and , eventually, to any rate increases, I ’m wondering if you can walk us through what “ substantial further progress ” looks like , given the latest batch of projections  that have PCE inflation coming in a little higher than the June projection, the unemployment rate also being higher than June, as w ell as the change to GDP lower than June."
 So the test for beginning our taper  is that we ’ve achieved substantial further progress toward our goals of [2 percent] inflation and maximum employment.
" And for inflation, we appear to have achieved more than significant progress—substantial further progress."
 So the question is really on the maximum -employment test.
" So if you look at a good number of indicators, you will see that, since last December , when we articulated the test , and the readings today, in many cases mo re than half of the distance, for example, between the unemployment rate in December of 2020 and typical estimates of the  natural rate —50 or 60 percent of that road has been traveled."
"   September 22, 2021 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 6 of 27   Many on the Committee feel that the “ substantial further progress ” test for employment has been met."
 I guess my own view would be that the test —the “substantial further progress ” test for employment is all but met.
" So , looking at the SEPs , we got now basically four years of inflation above target , and policy never gets to the longrun rate."
" So , as you can see, the inflation forecasts have moved up a bit in the outyears."
" So that suggests that inflation ’s going to be higher this year , and a number —I guess the inflation rates for next year and 2023 were also marked up, but just by a couple of tenths."
"  You know, we want to foster a strong labor market, and we want to foster inflation averaging 2 percent over time, and I think we ’re very much on track to achieve those things."
  We want inflation expectations to be anchored at around 2 percent.
" And, you know, we do want inflation to run moderately above 2 percen t."
" For those that want to move a bit more quickly, is it about maintaining optionality for a 2022 interest rate increa se?"
" Then , as th e recovery got going, they supported aggregate demand, as they will do."
  Or do they believe that either inflation or economic growth will necessitate a rate increase sooner than you do?
 It ’s labor market conditions consistent with maximum employment.
" Inflation at 2 percent and on track to achieve it, September 22, 2021 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 9 of 27   moderately higher inflation over 2 percent —you know, that really depends on the path of inflation."
" If inflation remains higher during the course of 2022, then we may already have met that test by the time we reach liftoff."
"  So I just think, if you look at what people are writing down for year -end 2022 numbers, some people are writing down very low unemployment rates ."
" You and other Fed  officials have often talked ab out expecting a job market pickup in September as more children return to school, freeing up more parents to work, COVID abating."
 You mentioned in the past the extra unemployment benefits expiring.
" So our view, I think —widespread view a few months ago was that several things were coming together in the fall, including kids back to school, which would, you know, which would lighten caregiving duties, including th e expiration of unemployment —extra unemployment benefits, and other things would come together to provide an increase in labor supply, and so we ’d get out of this strange world where there ’re lots of unemployed people and a high unemployment rate but a labor shortage."
" So, you know, for me, it wouldn’ t take a knockout, great, super strong employment report."
 It would take a reasonably good employment report for me to feel like that test is met.
" So I don’ t personally need to see a very strong employment report, but I ’d like to see a good—a decent employment report."
" Chair Powell, I wanted to ask about the inclusive monetary policy framework."
" In particular, Bloomberg surveyed economists, and we found that they predict liftoff will happen when the U.S. unemployment rate is 3.8 percent but  the B lack unemployment rate is 6.1 percent."
 And I ’m wondering if a 6.1 percent unemployment rate for African  Americans is consistent with full employment o r whether it would need to be lower as part of your inclusive growth strategy .
" Right, so the point of the broad and inclusive goal was not to target a particular unemployment rate for any particular group."
" Really , we look at a broad range of —a very broad range of metrics when we think about what maximum employment is."
 And one of the things we look at is unemployment rates and participation rates and wages for different demographic and age groups and that kind of thing.
"  We also saw the lowest unemployment rates for minorities of various, you know, for African  Americans, for example, and also participation rates."
"  We also said we wouldn ’t raise rates just in response to very low unemployment , in the absence of inflation."
" We have significant slack in the economy and inflation well above target, not moderately above target."
" It isn ’t really just targeting the headline numbers, but it ’s about taking all of those things into account in your thinking about what constitutes maximum employment."
"  Just to follow  up, s hould there be a significant gap bet ween Black unemployment and overall unemployment for structural reasons that are outside of the control of the Fed  that other people should be doing something about?"
" Chair Powell, I wanted to ask about how  the F ed would balance the two parts of its dual mandate if inflation stays elevated but we still have a labor shortage and participation remains lower than ideal ."
" You’re looking for conditions consistent with maximum employment to lift off, and those conditions can change over time."
" So you’ re not necessarily bound by a particular level of the unemployment rate or the participation rate or anything else like that, which can change over time."
" And if we judge that ’s effect —that is the case, what it says is , we take i nto account the employment shortfalls and inflation deviations and the potentially different time horizons over which employment and inflation are projected to return to levels judged consistent with the mandate."
 You talked a little bit about inflation expectations.
" For the most part, surveys are showing that households expect higher inflation in the near  term but not in the lo nger term."
"  So there are many, many different inflation measures, of course."
" And, you know, it tells a story of inflation expectations moving up."
" Many of the different measures will also show inflation expectations moving back up to where they were in, say , 2013, which was before the really— the drop in inflation expectations broadly happened in ’ 14 and ’ 15—around then."
"  But, you know, inflation expectations are terribly important."
" And because, you know, inflation expectations had drifted down, and it was good to see them get back up a bit."
" But with your concerns about the potential for upside risks  to inflation, would you think you might need to have liftoff happen before you finish the tapering?"
