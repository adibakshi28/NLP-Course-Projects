Growth is running at a healthy clip.
" U nemployment is low, the number of people working is ri sing steadily, and wages are up."
Inflation is low and stable.
"Each time my colleagues and I meet, we face the same question: How can we set policy to best support job growth and low , steady inflation?"
" For many  years, this question called for very low interest rates to hel p an economy that had been damage d by the deep financial crisis that gripped the world 10 years ago."
" As the economy has steadi ly gained strength, the Fed has been gradually returning interest rates closer to levels that a re normal in a healthy economy."
 We took another step on that path toda y with a quarterpoint incre ase in shortterm interest rates.
" In addition to holding interest rates low to  support the recovery, we have also taken many steps to make the financial system safer."
"Both household spending a nd business investment are expanding briskly, and the overall growth outlook remains favorable."
 The median o f Committee participants’ projections for the growth of r eal GDP is 3.1 percent this year  and 2.5 percent next year.
 The unemployment rate stood at 3.9 percen t in August and has been near that leve l since April.
We expect the job market to remain strong.
 And the median of Committee participants’ projections for the unemployment rate later this year is 3.7 percent and a bit lower than that in 2019.
"Overall consumer prices, as m easured by the price index for per sonal consumption expenditures (PCE inflation), increased 2.3 percent over the 12  months ending in July."
" The core price index, which excludes the prices of energy and food and t ends to be a better indicator of Page 2 of 29     September 26, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference FINAL future inflation, rose 2 percent over the same period."
" The FOM C seeks, and expects to see, inflation remaining near our 2 percent longerrun objective on a sustained basis."
" At any given time, inflation may be somewhat above or below 2 percent."
" For example, the recent rise in oil prices has pushed inflation a little above 2 percent, but we ex pect this to be transitory, as is reflected in our projections."
The median projections for both the overall and core inflation measures remain very close to 2 pe rcent across the whole projection horizon.
 This action reflects th e strength we see in the economy and is one more step in the process that we began almost three year s ago of gradually returning interest rates to more normal levels.
" Looking ahead, today’s projections show gradual interest rate increases continuing roughly as foreseen in June."
" The projections about the appropriate path of policy assume that the economy evo lves broadly in line with the  projections for growth, employment, unemployment, and inflation."
" If the economy were i nstead to falter , lower interest rates would be appropriate."
"Conve rsely, if inflationary pressu res were to rise more than expected, higher inte rest rates would be appropriate."
  President Trump has stated publicly he’s not thrilled with the interest rate hikes.
 And do you have any concerns about the eff ect of these types of commen ts on the perception of the Fed’s independence and your monetary policy?
" We have  disparate points o f view, which we debate extensively and come to a perspe ctive and try to set monetary p olicy to achieve maximum employment in a context of pri ce stability."
"Can you explain how—the stock market be ing at a near alltime high, cor porate spreads being very tight—how does the level of the market factor into your decisio ns to raise interest rates?"
" T he part of it t hat we control, though, is what we do with the federal funds rate a nd that has—that has effects ou t through, you know, out through the full interest rate curve a nd into financial asset prices ge nerally."
" Because you’ve got four years here of unemployment below 4 percent—very low, substantiall y below NAIRU, what appears to be NAIRU—but no reaction of inflation there."
" Or in the alternative, is this forec ast for unemployment just being driven by your confidence interva ls to the extent that, well, w e don’t know what else to do, so just extend the lie out—line out until something happens?"
" The Committee forecasts wh at they—what they show, in general, is an economy where unemployment remains  in the high and middle 3s throughout the entire forecast period and inflation remains ver y close to 2 percent."
" And that is based on our understanding of the way the inflation process works now and on the fact that the inflation seems to be fairly  nonreactive to changes in slack— that is to say, a flat Phillips curve."
 And it’s just—it’s a—it’s a world of strongly anchored inflation expectations.
" So you may ask—I mean, the sense is, what does the longerrun natural rate of unemployment mean?"
" If inflation reacts more strongly or more weak ly to the strong economy, then  we’ll adjust policy appropriately."
"If I coul d follow up on that, what are you buying with interest rates?"
"Well, interes t rates, of course, have effects  on growth, have effects—I mean if—I guess the —your question was, what are you buying with by raising interest rates?"
" One is that  if we move too quickly, we can, you know, snuff out a recovery unnecessarily, and inflation falls short of its 2 percent targe t."
" And we think that gradually, you know, rai sing interest rates is the way that we kind of take both of those risks seriously."
" You know, employment is h igh, wages are rising, that sort of thing."
" Trade generally supports productivity, supports higher incomes."
 This is the third time this year that the FOMC has raised its growth forecasts.
" The id ea is to encourage more investment, and that is one of the things that drives productivity, which is one of the main things that drives rising incomes."
" But, you know, as I said, we—I certainly hop e—I hope that we’ll be marki ng up our estimates of potential growth as well."
" You know, the main thing where we mi ght need to move along a little  bit quicker would be if inflation—inflation s urprises to the upsid e."
"In terms of what, you know, what we would do—you know, I think we’re always going to be adjusting monetary policy to—in light of conditions on th e ground."
 The unemployment rate is now at  3.9 percent.
" Inflation, according to your numbers, holding steady."
" The amount of job vacancies that we have out there and the number of people coming back into the workforce this year—where is the point at whic h, then, we are actually above the natural rate of unemployment and the Federal Reserve should r eexamine the consistency of the rate hikes going forward so not to cool an expanding economy?"
"You mean—you mean, where’s the point at which  inflation— unemployment is too low?"
It’ s one of the things that ha s allowed the unemployment rate not to fall further.
 And at what point  do you start to become worried that it’s actual ly going to affect consumer spending and dampening economic growth?
" And the other question would be, if you’re just talking about the effect on inflati on is, is it just a onetime increase in the price level, or is it actually fueling  higher inflation going forward?"
"We’re seeing a sort of modest  increase in wages, inflation  right around 2 percent, no sense of it moving up really, so we’re not seeing it yet."
The dot plot  is individual FOMC particip ants who are writing down their individual views on the evolu tion of the economy and of appropr iate monetary policy.
" You know, we put that in the statement in 2015, just when we lifted off, and  the idea was to provide assurance that we weren’t trying to slo w down the economy, but, in fact, we were still—interest rates were still going to be pushing to suppor t economic activity."
" But if you look at—look at interest rates, you know, interest r ates—look at longterm interest rates this year and shortterm int erest rates this year, there’ s very significant increases."
 Are you worried about the effect of risi ng interest rates on consumers?
"Yeah, we look—of  course, we look at that very  carefully, and interest rates are going up acro ss a broad range of consumer bo rrowing, as they would when we raise shortterm interest ra tes."
" You know, the effect on consumer spending is a very important channel through whic h interest rates work, and so we do monitor the effects."
" What are the odds that productivity, you know, investment, productivity, labor ma rket, other developments could further push up the longerrun estimate and possibly make the p rojected funds rate levels less restrictive than they now seem?"
"So, in principle,  the—these starred variables—the longrun growth rate of the economy, the neutral ra te of interest, the n atural rate of unemployment—don’t move quickly."
" It’ s a tenth we’re talking about here, so—but still, I think it’ s a positive thing that people could be raising their estimates of the longerrun neutral rate and poten tially the longerrun growth r ate."
" And maybe reducing their level of the natural rate of unemployment, which  has been the trend."
" I don’t expect a dramatic recovery there, but, you know, we—we’re so bad at fore casting productivity."
" But, specifically, what are you going to be looking to see, because you’ve also mentioned, you know, that monetary policy operates with a lag, so any kind of specific signposts that may be we’ve reached the end of the Page 22 of 29     September 26, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference FINAL tightening cycle or where we s hould stop?"
" Secondly, if you wor ry about the divergence between interest rates in the U.S. and internationally, especially at a  time when emerging markets are under pressure."
"So, you know , some of the things that we’d be looking at to tell us whether we’re getti ng close to supplyside limits wo uld be, first, does job growth slow down?"
" You know, if headline growth slowed down, that’ s another one."
" So the U.S. economy is, as I mentioned, is strong and is at a pretty positive moment, you know, with strong growth, heal thy labor market, inflation right on target, as I mentioned."
" So—a nd we’ve seen growth abroad, bu t growth, I think, both in advanced economies and in some emerging economies has slowed do wn a little bit."
 It could be—it co uld therefore mean that some of our demand will wind up being shared with other economies.
" L ast month, the CEA outlined a different way to calculate wage growth."
" If y ou look at the principal four that we look at—we look at a w hole range of wage and benefit co st indicators—they are all now showing wages and benefits around 3 percent growth, right?"
" Then the question—the other question is , what about inflation?"
" You know , if you’re—if you’re looking for real wage increases, you’ ve got to ask inflation, and there , you have to pick an inflation measure."
 PCE headline inflation is at 2.3 percent.
"PCE core is at a bout 2, and I think we see tha t, you know, the temporary increase in headline inflation as bei ng a function of oil prices probabl y, and we expect inflation to go back down to 2 percent."
" You were talking about longerte rm structural Page 25 of 29           September 26, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference FINAL challenges for the economy, and you mentioned that addressing the federal budget deficit, which has long been on an unsustainable path, becomes increasingly important as a larger share of the population retires."
 And we do—we do monetary policy.
" These are, you know, this is—this is the economy a t nearly full employment or in the range—in the neighborhood of f ull employment."
" What do you think about impact of U.S. monetary policy on emergi ng markets—interest rate, curr ency depreciation, or capital outflow from emerging countri es?"
 And do you think there is a p ossibility to stop t he interest rate hike due to emerging markets turmoil—due to turmoil in emerging  markets?
"Well, we serve a domestic mandate, which is a ssigned to us by Congress, and that is to have max imum employment and stable pri ces."
" About half of global GDP is outside the United States,  and way more than half of the  growth is outside the United States and in emerging markets,  I should say."
" I’d also say that, you know, a strong U.S. economy, where Americans are buying thi ngs and the economy is growing and our—you know, that’s going to support demand all around the globe, so that’s a good thing."
"Now, we do understand, though, that when we—when our economy is  strong and we’re raising rates, that puts upward pressure on interest rates arou nd the world and can affect countries, particularly countries  that have significant externa l dollar borrowing."
" It’s a relatively small number, and those particular countries have,  you know, have particular vulnerabil ities, which are w ell known in the form of budget deficits, and significant external dollar borrow ings, and high inflation, and things like that."
"So, again, we’ll cont inue to conduct U.S. monetary policy as transparently as we Page 27 of 29     September 26, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference FINAL possibly can, and that’s really  the best thing we can do, along with supporting U.S. growth."
