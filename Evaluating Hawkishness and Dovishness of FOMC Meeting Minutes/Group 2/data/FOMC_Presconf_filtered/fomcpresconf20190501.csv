" At the FOMC meeting that concluded today, we reviewed economic and financial developments in the Uni ted States and around the world and decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged."
  My colleagues and I have one overarching goal:  to use our monetary policy tools to sustain the economic expansion with a strong job market and stable prices for the benefit of the American people.
" Economic growth and job creation have both been a bit stronger than we anticipated, while inflation has been somewhat weaker."
" The Committee also believes that solid underlying fundamentals are supporting the economy, including accommodative financial conditions, high employment and j ob growth, rising wages, and strong consumer and business sentiment."
" Although first -quarter GDP rose more than most forecasters had expected, growth in private consumption and business fixed investment slowed."
" Recent data suggest that these two components will bounce back, supporting our expectation of healthy GDP growth over the rest of the year."
  The Committee is strongly committed to our symmetric 2 percent inflation objective.
" For much of this long expansion, inflation ran a bit below our 2 percent objective, alongside considerable slack in resource utilization."
" But last year, with the unemployment rate at or below 4 percent, inflation moved up."
" From March through December, core inflation—which excludes volatile food and energy components —was at or very close to 2 percent."
" Overall inflation May 1, 2019     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 2 of 20   fluctuated from a few ten ths above 2 percent to a few tenths below over this period, with the moves mostly due to changes in energy prices."
" As expected, overall inflation fell at the start of this year as earlier oil price declines worked through the system."
 Overall inflation fo r the 12 months ended in March was 1.5 percent.
" Core inflation unexpectedly fell as well, however, and as of March stood at 1.6 percent for the previous 12 months."
" Thus, our baseline view remains t hat, with a strong job market and continued growth, inflation wil l return to 2 percent over time  and then be roughly symmetric around our longer -term objective."
"  At the start of the year, a number of crosscurrents  presented risks to the outlook, including  weak global growth, particularly in China and Europe; the possibility of a disruptive Brexit; and uncertainty around unresolved trade negotiations."
" Global financ ial conditions have eased, supported in many places around the world by an accommodative shift in monetary policy and, in some cases , fiscal policy."
" The Committee views these developments, along with the outlook for continued growth, a strong job market, and muted inflation  pressures , as consistent with continued patience in assessing further adjustments in monetary policy."
" In the wake of the crisis, the Fed bought a large amount of longer -term securities with the aim of lowering longer -term interest rates and, thus , supporting the recovery."
"  Final ly, we made a small technical adjustment in one of our tools for implementing monetary policy :  the interest  rate on excess reserves, or  IOER rate."
 The change does not reflect any shift in the intended stance of monetary policy.
" As the statement noted, core inflation is now running below 2 percent —it’s been falling for three straight months , and while you’ ve been close, it ’s only been at 2 percent or above one month since 2012."
" Mr. Chair , I guess I wonder , is it time to address low inflation through policy , and can you give us some sense of your metric for when it would be time?"
" So, first, we are strongly committed to our 2 percent inflation objective and to achieving it on a sustained and symmetric basis."
 I would point out that inflation actually ran—including core inflation —actually ran pretty close to 2 percent for much of 2018.
 So we say in our S tatement of Longer -Run G oals and M onetary P olicy S trategy that the Committee would be concerned if inflation were running persistently above or below 2 percent.
" In addition, the May 1, 2019     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 5 of 20   trimmed mean measures of inflation did not go down as much."
"  But to go back to your question, if we did see a persistent —inflation running persistently below, then that is something the Committee would be concerned about and something that we would take into account in setting policy."
" That ’s just good monetary policy, good monetary control."
  So we do say that risks to the financial system —we say in our longer -run stat ement of goals and monetary policy strategy that risks  to the financial system that could prevent us from achieving our goals are something that we do take into consideration.
 Those are better first -order tools to deal with these kinds of issues than monetary policy.
" Chair Powell,  with the benefit of hindsight, did last year ’s rate increases make it harder for the Fed to credibly affirm its 2 percent symmetric inflation target is not, in fact , a ceiling?"
"  And, if so, would it be appropriate to lower rates if core inflation remained  persistently closer to 1 ½ percent instead of 2 percent?"
"  And, if not, do you worry about any unwelcome tightening in real rates , given the recent softness in core inflation?"
" So, to your first question, if you go back and think about the middle of last year, inflation was at 2 percent and appeared to be staying there."
 I do think it ’s important that inflation run close to and sustainably —for a sustained period of time —and symmetrically around 2 p ercent .
" Because if it doesn ’t, you run the risk that inflation expectations can—it has been the case, most of the misses are on the downside —inflation expectations over time could be pulled down, and that could put downward pressure on inflation and make it harder for us to react to downturns and harder for us to, you know, support the economy in difficult times."
"  So as you just mentioned, las t year when you guys were kind of getting inflation coming in around 2 percent, you had this benefit of the tailwind of fiscal stimulus."
" So , I guess, how do you think about inflation as that fiscal benefit wanes toward the end of this year?"
" Inflation, first of all—monthto-month, quarter -toquarter —is going to move around."
" So probably the biggest single factor driving it is the rate of underlying inflation or the closely related idea of where inflation May 1, 2019     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 10 of 20   expectations are anchored —the thought being , that ’s where inflation will go in the long run if it ’s not been pushed by those other factors."
" And , again, we do expect that this reading will be transient and inflation will move back up."
 Growth is at a healthy level.
" Inflation is low, which gives us the ability to be patient , and we do expect it  to move up, and we want it to move up to 2 percent."
" This was before inflation really was under control , but, you know, it’ s very interesting to look at the history."
" You ’ve repeatedly said that the F ed’s going to conduct monetary policy without regard to outside political pressure , but it seems like the P resident is intent on in creasing that political pressure."
" And what we ’re alw ays solving for in our process, in our work, is to carry out our mission, which is to extend the economic expansion, keep the labor market strong, and get inflation around 2 percent."
" We go away, we think about that, and we come back, and the next day we talk about monetary policy."
" And in this particular case, we came to a unanimous decision , after an extensive discussion , that our monetary policy stance is appropriate where it is."
" And we think our monetary policy stance is in a good place, and we ’re going to be patient as we consider adjustments."
" In the l ast 23 years, core PCE inflation has run above 2 percent only during the period that coincided with the housing bubble."
 I’d like to know what you would say to people who worry that it will pr ove difficult for the F ed to lift inflation without potentially stoking another asset bubble of some sort.
" So you’ re pointing to, really , the fact that in recent years inflation has moved down and down, and, really, many major central banks have struggled to reach their inflation goals from below."
" And it ’s just a question, I think, of demographic and other large and, in some cases, global forces that are disinflationary to some extent , and it creates significant challenges."
" One, I would say, is , it means that interest rates will be lower —will be closer to the effective lower bound more of the time because t hat means lower interest rates."
" And that ’s one of the reasons we ’re having a review of our monetary policy strategies, tools, and communications this year —to think about that problem."
 So isn’ t that a dark cloud on your outlook for strong growth for the rest of the year?
" I mean, how much weight does it hold for you, and is it a sign that monetary policy might be too tight?"
" Ye s, we see that reading as —it’ s still a positive reading and consistent with what we expect from the manufacturing sector, which is moderate or perhaps modest growth."
" So it’s—yes, it ’s something tha t we are watching carefully , but we do expect a positive contribution to growth from the manufacturing sector."
 You mentioned—talked about domestic growth a little bit with the economy.
 Could you talk about a little bit of the domestic growth that you ’re seeing going forward for the rest of the year ?
economy for growth for the rest of this year.
" A nd, as I mention ed, the conditions, the broader economic fundamentals, are strong in support of consumer spending —that’s more accommodative financial conditions, high confidence readings, high levels of employment, wages going up."
"  Getting back to inflation, can you talk more about the transitory factors holding down inflation, how significant they are, and why you think those facto rs will pass?"
" Let me say, I don ’t mean to diminish concerns about toolow inflation , but I think there ’s good reason to think that these readings are particularly influenced by some transitory factors."
" And another way to look at it is , there are models that look at inflation in different ways , like—not models, but measures , like the Dallas trimmed mean, as I mentioned."
"  So trimmed mean—it cuts off the big movements on the upside and the downside and looks at just the mean movements in inflation of various product categories and service categories , and it didn’ t go down at all."
" Many of you wil l remember , in March of 2017, there was a May 1, 2019     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 17 of 20   very low reading for cell phone services —mobile phone services —and it was kind of a price war, and it dragged down core inflation for a full year , but it did not look like something that would be repeated."
" And we kind of thought so and said so, and then, sure enough, in 2018, we had those months of 2 percent inflation."
"  We ’re going to be watching —really, I ’d like to say we’re going to be watching inflation carefully to see that t hese things are transient , and I ’ll end by saying we are strongly committed to the 2 percent inflation objective."
" You were saying if inflation does stay low  and these low inflation rates are not transient, you said a couple times you ’ll take that into account with monetary policy."
 So a cut in interest rates would be possible?
" And then, can you speak to any other strategies or tools that might be useful for keeping a ceiling on short -term interest rates?"
" I mean, we’re —with—the balance sheet is now —the size of it is going to be driven by demand for liabilities, principally reserves, as I mentioned."
 And we ’re right at that point where we’re starting to learn more and more about what the real demand for reserves is over the next few months.
" So given what you ’ve said about the expectations for consumption and also business fixed investment perhaps bouncing back in the next GDP reading, I ’m wondering if you think that continued growth in economic activity might show some sort of underlying fundamental that could flag another overheating."
"  For example, the median projection in the March meeting for GDP growth for 2019 was 2.1, so I ’m just kind of curious about what you see going forward if we continue to see strong GDP numbers."
" We see inflation below 2 percent now —as I mentioned, pretty close to 2 percent for most of last year."
" Nonetheless, you have very strong job creation, and you have wages moving up at a rate that is appropriate , given inflation and given productivity , but not at all signaling any overheating at all."
 It’s not higher than that rate that would incorporate both inflation and productivity .
" Can you kind of give us a read on—but more substantively, can you give us a read on how the Committee views productivity growth, if it’ s accelerating enough?"
 You mentioned productivity.
 So productivity is really very difficult to predict.
" But I will say this :  Productivity was very, very low in the wake of the crisis for six or seven years."
" Last year, we had 1.9 percent productivity, which is much higher."
" Really , there has been a significant positive supply -side development over the last year  and a half between the uptick in labor force participation, which goes back several years, but also productivity."
