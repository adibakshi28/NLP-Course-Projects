" And finally, I ’ll place today ’s policy decision in the context of our economic projections and our assessments of the appropriate path  of monetary policy ."
"  As indicated in the statement released earlier this afternoon, to support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time , is at levels consistent w ith our statutory mandate, the Committee  expects to maintain a highly accommodative stance for monetary policy ."
 This statement should not be interpreted as indicating any change in how the Federal Reserve conducts monetary policy .
" There is today widespread agreement that clear and transparent central bank communications fa cilitate wellinformed decisionmaking by households and businesses, reduce economic and financial January 25, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL    2 of 29 uncertainty, increase the effectiveness of  monetary policy , and enhance accountability to the public ."
"  The statement begin s by noting the Committee ’s firm commitment to fulfill our statutory mandate of promoting maximum employment, stable prices , and moderate long -term interest rates ."
" Since monetary policy actions tend to influence economic activity and prices with a lag, our decisions appropriately reflect the Committee ’s longer -run goals, our medium -term outlook, and our assessment of the balance of  risks , including risks to the financial system that could impede the attainment of o ur goals ."
" With respect to the objective of price stability, it is essential to recognize that the  inflation rate over the longer  run is primarily determined by monetary policy, and hence the Committee  has the ability  to specify a longer -run goal for inflation."
" Over time, a higher inflation rate would reduce the public ’s ability to make accurate longer -term economic and financial decisions, whereas a  lower inflation rate would be associated with an elevated probability of falling into deflation , which can lead to significant economic problems ."
 Clearly communicating to the public this 2 percent goal for inflation over the longer  run should help foster price stability and moderate long -term interest rates  and will enhance the Committee ’s ability to promote maximum employment in the face of significant economic disturbances .
  Maximum employment stands on an equal footing with price stability as an objective of monetary policy .
" Because monetary policy does not determine the maximum level of employment that the economy can sustain in the longer term, and since many of the determinants of maximum employment may change over time or may not be directly measurable, it i s not feasible for any central bank to specify a fixed goal for the longer -run level of employment ."
"  Although the Committee  cannot freely choose a longer -run goal for employment, it can estimate the level of maximum employment and use that estimate to inf orm its  policy decisions ."
" The Committee  considers a wide range of indicators in  making its  assessments of maximum employment, recognizing that such assessments are necessarily uncertain and subject to revision over time ."
" For example, in the latest set of  projections that have been distributed to you, Committee  partic ipants ’ estimates of the longer -run normal rate of unemployment have a central tendency of 5.2 per cent to 6.0 percent —roughly unchanged from last January but higher than the corresponding inte rval several years ago ."
" As I noted, the level of maximum employment is not immutable ; in particular, it could be increased by effective polic ies, such as education  and training that improve work force skills ."
" If the Committee ’s assessments pointed to an increase in the maximum attainable level of employment, our policy strategy would be modified appropriately to aim at the higher level ."
"  In setting monetary policy, the Committee  seeks to mitigate deviations of inflation from its mandateconsistent rate and deviations of employment from our assessments of its maximum level ."
" For example, under present circumstances, in which the unemployment rate is elevated and the inflation outlook is subdued, the Committee  judges that sustaining a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy is January 25, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL    4 of 29 consistent with promoting bot h objectives ."
" And in the longer  term, low and stable inflation can help promote healthy growth in output and employment ."
" In such cases, the Committee  follows a balanced approach in promoting these two objectives, taking into account the magnitude of the deviations and potentially different time horizons over which inflation and employment are projected to return to levels judged consistent with our mandate ."
" In other words , the Committee always treat s its primary objectives of pric e stability and maximum employment symmetrically, and the stance of policy at any given time is determined by the size, social cost, and expected evolution of the deviations of each of the Committee ’s policy objectives from its desired level."
 The longer -run projections —shown at the right of each figure —represent participants ’ assessments of the rate to which each variable will converge over time under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy .
"  Incoming in formation suggests that the economy has been expanding moderately , notwithstanding some slowing in global growth."
" The Committee  expects the pace of economic growth to be , over  coming quarters —to be moderate over  coming quarters, reflecting ongoing drags f rom the housing sector and still -tight credit conditions for many households and smaller businesses ."
" Specifically, participants ’ projections for the growth rate of real gross domestic January 25, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL    5 of 29 product in 2012 have a central tendency of 2.2 to 2.7 percent ."
"  Looking further ahead, economic activity is expected to acceler ate gradually in conjunction with strengthening consumer and business confidence, improving financial  conditions , and the  continuation of  a highly accommodative stance for monetary policy ."
" Specifically, participants ’ GDP projections  for 2013 have a central tendency of 2.8 to 3.2 percent, and their projections for 2014 have a central tendency of 3.3 to 4.0 percent, noticeably higher than the central tendency of 2.3 to 2.6 percent  for their longerrun growth projections ."
"  A number of recent indicators point to some further improvement in overall labor market conditions, but the unemployment rate remains el evated ."
" Moreover, in light of the anticipated modest pace of economic recovery, the Committee  expects that over coming quarters the unemployment rate will decline only gradually toward its mandateconsistent levels ."
" Indeed, participants ’ projections for the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of this year have a central tendency o f 8.2 to 8.5 percent  that is  little different from the latest monthly reading of 8.5 percent ."
" With economic growth expected to pick up somewhat over time, the unemployment rate is expected to decline to 6.7 to 7.6 percent by the fourth quarter of 2014—still well above partic ipants ’ estimates of the longer -run normal rate of unemployment ."
  I’ll turn now to the outlook for inflation.
" The prices of oil and other commodities ha ve generally flattened out or turn ed downward over the past couple of quarters, while low levels of resource utilization have continued to constrain the growth of labor cost s."
" Consequently, consumer price inflation —which surged in the first half of last y ear—has been subdued in recent months ."
" Survey measures and financial market indicator s imply that longer -term inflation January 25, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL    6 of 29 expectations have remained stable."
" Over coming quarters, the Committee  anticipates that inflation will run at or below levels consiste nt with the mandateconsistent rate of 2 per cent."
" Specifically, participant s’ inflation projections have a central tendency of 1.4 to 1.8 percent for 2012 and remain subdued at around 1½ to 2 percent through 2014."
"  As a further step in enhancing the clarity of our communications, the Committee  recently decided to begin publishing information about participants ’ assessments of appropriate monetary policy —that is , the path of policy th at each participant judges as most  likely to foster mandateconsistent outcomes for employment and inflation if the economy evolves as expected."
" These judgments about  future policy underlie the participants ’ projections of growth, unemployment , and inflation that I just described."
" In particular, the Committee  recognizes the  hardships imposed by high and persistent unemployment and  an underperforming economy , and it is prepared to provide further monetary accommodation if employment is not making sufficient progress towar d our assessment s of its maximum level or if inflation show s signs of  moving further below its mandate -consistent rate ."
"Chairman, we’ve had  several months of economic data that ’s been stronger than most forecasters expected —employment was over 200,000, the unemployment rate ’s come down to 8½ percent —but there seems to be very li ttle mention  of this recent strength in the statement."
 And are you and the Committee  baking i n additional quantitative easing in order to achieve the growth rates that you ’ve even forecast here?
" We will, as I ’ve said in my statement, and as we have in fact in the FOMC statement, you know, we continue to review our holdings —our portfolio holdings, securities , and we are prepared to take further steps in that directi on if we  see that the recovery’s  faltering or if inflation is not moving toward target."
" It seems to say that you expect that at the end of 2014, unemployment will be at or above 7 percent , inflation will be at or below 2 percent —and yet 11 of the 17 members of your Committee  think that will be a good moment to start raising interest rates again ."
" If unemployment and inflati on are in fact symmetric objectives for the Fed, how can that possibly be the case?"
 And is there any tolerance for above -trend inflation in the service of catch -up growth?
" We ’ve ke pt interest rates close to zero , we’ve done two rounds of asset purchases , we have announced—today , in fact —an extension of January 25, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL    9 of 29 the period over which we expect to see rates very low , and our maturity extension program is still ongoing, so we maintain a quite accommodative path of policy at this point ."
 I would further say that I think it’ s important to emphasize that we ’re not going to mechanically take the interest rate projections that participants p rovide and just build policy off of that .
" Now, all that being said, if inflation is going to remain below target for an extended period, and unemployment progress is very slow, then I think your implicit question is right, t here is a case for additional policy action , and we ’ll—you know, we want to continue to observe the situation, but we ’re certainly prepared to look for different ways to provide support to the economy if , in fact , we have this unsatisfactory situation ."
" Congrats on the inflation target, or goal —that’s a big achievement for you, I ’m sure ."
 I’d like to ask if you could explain a little bit the way you think inflation is now working in the economy .
" The 2012 central tendency is kind of low , and along with that question, I ’d like to know where you think full employment is in the near  term , like the next year or t wo, given the structural impediments that many Fed officials have been talking about ."
" Well, there are a number of factors that make us expect inflation to be quite low in the next couple of years ."
" Certainly, we are seeing a reversal , or at least a  flattening out, of the commodity price increases that caused headline inflation to rise earlier in 2011."
" And the futures markets , and  our own estimates of supply and demand globally with the slowing global economy , suggest that most likely —although, of course , there ’s a lot of uncertainty —that commodity prices will remain well controlled over the next couple of years ."
" January 25, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL    10 of 29 On top of that , of course , we have a very high rate of unemployment ; pressure on wages is quite restrained ."
" And putting that t ogether with strong productivity gains, the cost s of production—unit labor costs —are growing very slowly ."
" Expectations of inflation seem well anchored  and, in fact, have been on the low side relative to recent history in recent months ."
" So for all those reasons, inflation looks to be at or modestly below th e 2 percent target going forward."
" With respect to the maximum employment measure, we provided a —we h ave been providing , in fact , for four years , as long as we’ve been provi ding the economic projections —an estimate of the longrun sustainable rate of unemployment , which is currently —the central tendency is currently 5.2 to 6 percent ."
" We ’re concerned that the large amount of long -term unemployment may be causing some workers to lose skills or lose labor force attachment, which, at least for a while , will also likely increase the so -called natural rate, or sustainable rate, of unemployment ."
"Chairman, how much confidence do you have in the FOMC ’s ability to forecast the economy and inflation out three  years?"
" And consequently, how much confidence do you have in the interest rate projections that the Fed has made public today, particularly the ones that go out to 2014 and beyond?"
" So when we look at these projections, are we really seeing the most likely expected path of interest rates because the C hairman ’s view is n’t represented exclusively here?"
" That being said, you know, currently, the zero  lower bound on policy rates —at least according to many estimates —is still binding ; that is, even if the economy were a bit stronger, the very low interest rates we currently have would still be valid, still be appropriate ."
" So, as we talk about interest rates in 2014, the fact that there is quite wide -ranging agreement that interest rates will be low for a long time, should give you more confidence that that ’s not dependent on a single individual ."
"Chairman, the Fed ’s statutory goals are price stability and maximum employment, but traditionally the Fed has interpreted that somewhat flexib ly in the sense that if there was  a conflict between the two, they would push for price stability rather than for full employment on the view that over  time, stable prices was the best contribution monetary policy could make to maximum  employment ."
" So following up a little bit on Binyamin ’s question, do I take it that if inflation wer e to move somewhat above  your 2 percent preferred level , that you would tolerate that in order to make further progress on unemployment?"
" We cannot cont rol, of course , where inflation  and unemployment are at each moment in time , and so there will be periods when, for reasons outside of our control, inflation and unemployment will move away from their desired levels ."
" So, for January 25, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL    13 of 29 example, if inflation did go above target by a modest amount, we would certainly try to get it back down to target , but if unemployment were very high, that would lead us to be more cautious and slower in returning to target ."
" I have a job to do, a nd as long as I ’m here, I will do everything I can to help the Federal Reserve achieve its dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment."
" In the case of savers, you know, we think about all these issues , and we certainly recognize that  the low interest rates that we ’re using to try to stimulate investment and expansion of the economy also impose a cost on savers who have a lower return ."
" So I think what we need to do, as is often the case when the economy goes into a very weak situation, then low interest rates are needed to help re store the economy to something closer to full employment and to increase growth and that , in turn, will lead  ultimately to higher return s across all assets for savers and investors ."
" One reason why it ’s extremely important for us to maintain price stability, of course, is that at least that minimizes any loss es due to inflation that savers might suffer ."
" In other words, a bank which is thought to be too big to fail gets an artificial subsidy in the interest rate that it can borrow at , and by having additional c apital  requirements , that tends to equalize the cost of funding to different banks and reduces the incentive of banks to get large just to cr eate the impression of being too big to fail ."
"Chairman , for more than three years now, the Fed has conducted policy through extraordinary means , and yet the new information that we have today pertains mostly to an eventual tightening of policy through raising interest rates ."
" You know , one is that it certainly remains —ex panding the balance sheet  certainly remains an option , one that we would consider very seriously if —in particular , if progress toward full employment was continued, or it became more, inadequate , or if inflation remained  exceptionally low ."
" I can make one additional point , which  maybe wasn ’t obvious, which is that , in June , we provided some principles relating the sales of assets —ultimate sales of assets —to the path of interest rates, and those remain —those principles remain in force ."
" The weakness of the housing sector is an important reason why the economy is not recovering more robustly, and the problems in housing finance are part of the reason why monetary polic y has not been more powerful —because part of our transmission mechanism is through lower interest rates , which affects refinancing ; it affects sales and purchases as well ."
" In other words, the average American ’s takeaway of your announcement to keep interest rates low —exceptionally low , through 2014 now , might signal to them that maybe the Fed thinks that the economy is in much worse shape than we a ll thought , January 25, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL    20 of 29 and that , in turn, could affect consumer confidence, consumer spending, and the ability to create a self -sustaining economic recovery at some point ."
" I mean, that ’s true not just in these current times , but anytime the Fed lowers or increases interest rates, and that ’s something we have to think about ."
 Just since August we have put a date on our expected period of low interest rates .
" So, you know, I don’ t accept the premise that we’ ve been passive ; we’ve been actually quite active in our policy , and in one respect, the low level of inflation is a validation in the following  sense , that there were some who we re very concerned that our balance sheet policies and the like would lead to high inflation ."
" Now that being said, as I mentioned earlier, if the situation continues , with inflation below target and unemployment declining at a rate which is very, very slow, then more —our framework, the logic of our framework, says  we should be looking for ways  to do more ."
" It’s not completely straightforward because, of course, we ’re now dealing with a variety of nonstandard policy tools —we can ’t just lower the federal funds rate 25 basis points like in the good old days —but your basic point is right , that, you know, we need to adopt policies that will both achieve our inflation objectives and help the economy recover as quickly as  is feasible."
" A nd, I would say that your question—actually , an earlier question —shows a benefit of explaining this framework because  the framework makes very clear that we need to be thinking about ways in which we can provide further stimulus if we don’ t get some improvement in the pace of recovery and a normalization of inflation ."
"Greenspan, once said about his personal inflation—longterm inflation goal that it would be 0 percent  if appropriately measured ."
" And, the second question is , Comparing  what you did today, are you approaching more some January 25, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL    22 of 29 kind of inflation target ers like the c entral b ank of Sweden or Norway , or are you approaching more the European Central Bank , for example, which has some kind of inflation goal but is not really an inflation target er?"
" So, a literal reading of price stability would say inflation should be at zero."
 There are probably some measurement biases and other issues that mean that a measured value of inflation above zero is probably consistent with stable prices .
" But as we ’ve talked about frequently, we set inflation —our inflation objective in a way that was consistent with both sides of the mandate :  price stability —and 2 percent is low enough that we believe that it’s not going to extensively interfere with financial planning and economic planning on the pa rt of households and businesses —but also in the interest of employment ."
  A target for inflation that was zero would have seve ral consequences .
" And we ’ve seen in many instances that deflation can be bad for economic performance and bad for employment , and , therefore, setting an inflation target at zero would be not  consistent with the other part of our mandate ."
" Incidentally, related t o that, a zero inflation rate would mean that nominal interest rates would be at very low levels, typically 2 to 3 percent or whatever they might be , and that would increase the risk and probability that we would be in a  situation like today where we reall y can ’t cut the short -term interest rate any further ."
 So I think there are good reasons from a dual -mandate perspective to have inflation greater than 2 percent .
" And I would add that , you know, if you look at central banks around the world, whether they are nominal inflation targeters or not, that 2 percent is basically the number that most central banks January 25, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL    23 of 29 use; the ECB, many other central banks either us e 2 percent or a range around 2  percent ."
"  Now, are we inflation targeters ?"
" If by “ inflation targeter ” you mean a central bank that puts top priority on inflation and other goals , like employment, as subsidiary goals , then the answer is no ."
 We are a dual -mandate central bank :  We put equal weight on price stability and maximum employment;  those are the goals given to us by the Congress .
" And so, in that respect, as I mentioned earlier , I think, to Greg, we ’re not absolutists :  If there ’s a need to let inflation return a little bit more slowly to target in order to get a better result in employment, then that ’s something that we would be willing to do ."
" Having said all that, I think it’ s worth noting that even banks that —central banks that call themselves inflation targeters typically pay at least some attention to other parts of the economy :  employment , growth, financial stability , and the like ."
" So I don’ t think there ’s really any central bank , or very few , at least , that focus only on inflation."
" But again, in terms of terminology, I guess I would reject that term for the Federal Reserve because we are going to be evenhanded in  treating the price stability and maximum employment parts of our mandate on a level footin g."
" And secondly, in the past, a number of times you said that even when interest r ates are at the zero bound, the Fed  can still have a significant impact on influencing economic growth ; do you still believe that the Fed has the capacity to deploy tools that would have a significant impact on bringing down unemployment at a faster pace than we see in these projections if it chose to do so?"
"  But I would say that, as I ’ve said on several —in several answers, that if recovery continues to be modest and progress on unemployment very slow , and if inflation appears to be likely to be below target for a number of years out —so the configuration we ’re talking about in the projections —then I think there would be a very strong case , based on our framework, for finding a different —additional tools for expansionary policies or to support the economy ."
" My own view , thinking about the effects, for example, of additional purchases —additional securities purchases, I’ve been pretty satisfied in the sense that —in the following sense, that purchases do seem to have the desired effects on f inancial conditions :  They tend to ease financial conditions, they tend to lower interest rates, they tend to strengthen asset prices ."
 And those are exactly the kinds of things that monetary policy normally does in order to try to provide stableness to the economy .
" So, you know, we don’ t set the federal funds interest rate by having members send in their vote and not having a meeting ; we have a meeting for a reason, which is to talk to each other and try to come to some  kind of consensus ."
" The FOMC stated that global growth has slowed and, of course , that is weighing on financial conditions in the U.S ."
 You’re linking your inflation target of 2 percent to the PCE .
" And the second question is related also to inflation January 25, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL    27 of 29 and to the targeting because  the Fed’s always been a little bit vague in terms of what sort of inflation it w ould accept , and this is a marked  change ."
" One is , it reduces the share of the inflation index  which is tied to housing ."
 So I think this is probably a better measure of the inflation that ’s faced by typical consumers than the CPI is .
" So, in that respect, I think if people look at the CPI, they should feel pretty comfortable that, you know, that ’s going to be very close to where the PCE inflation is ."
" And now , it’s true , as has been pointed out , that for the moment interest rates are pretty low , but they ’re still positive ."
" But over a longer period of time , if you —even if you have money in a CD or some other investment vehicle, the interest rate will compensate you for inflation."
" And so the re really shouldn’ t be, you know —at levels of inflation this low , interest rate s should pretty much fully compensate for the losses to savers ."
" But I would reiterate that  we are not unaware of the problems that low interest rates cause for savers, cause for pension fund contributions , insurance companies , and other parts of the economy , and we do try to take that into account as we think about other ramifications of our policy ."
