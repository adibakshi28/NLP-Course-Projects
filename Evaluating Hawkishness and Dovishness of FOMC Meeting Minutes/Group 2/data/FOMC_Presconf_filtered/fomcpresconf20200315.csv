" These measures, which are essential for containing the outbreak, will nonetheless understandably take a toll on economic activity in the near term."
" The Federal Reserve ’s role is guided by our mandate from Congress to promote maxi mum employment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to promote the stability of the financial system."
" Today we reduced the target range for our policy interest rate by 1 percentage point, bringing it close to zero, and said that we expect to maintain the rate at this level until we’re confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track  to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals."
 The unemployment rate was 3.5 percent in February and has been at or near half -century lows for almost two years.
" Overall economic activity has been expanding at a moderate rate, even though weak growth abroad and trade d evelopments have been weighing on some sectors."
" Like others, we expect that the illness  and the measures now being put in place to stem its spread will have a significant effect on economic activity in the near term."
" In addition, the effects of the outbreak are restraining economic activity in many foreign economies, which is causing difficulties for U.S. industries that rely on global supply chains."
" Inflation, which has continued to run below our symme tric 2 percent objective, will likely be held down this year by the effects of the outbreak."
" To improve the functioning of this market and to ensure the ef fective transmission of monetary policy to borrowers in the economy, we will also purchase at least $200 billion of agency mortgage -backed securities over coming months and immediately cease the runoff of these securities in our portfolio."
"The Federal Reserve announced a number of other actions today to s upport the flow of credit to households and businesses, thereby promoting our maximum employment and price stability goals."
" First, we reduced the interest rate on discount window loans by 1½ percentage points, bringing tha t rate to ¼ percent."
" The discount window plays an important role in supporting liquidity and stability in the banking system, and we encourage banks to turn to the discount window to help meet demands for credit from households and businesses."
" We are prepared to use our full range of tools to support the flow of credit to households and business, to help keep the economy strong, and to promote our maximum employment and price stability goals."
" We see that it is likely that the measures we take to protect ourselves from the virus will involve withdrawing from or reducing certain activities —thinking there of travel, leisure, hospitality, those things —and that ’s going to mean lower economic activity for a period of time."
"  In the meantime, the Fed will continue to use our tools to support the flow of credit to households and businesses and support demand with monetary policy —ultimately , to do what we can to see that the recovery is as vigorous as possible."
" I would point out that we have , of course , responded very strongly not just with interest rates, but also with liquidity measures today."
" Chair Powell, I ’m wondering , are you considering negative interest rates at this point?"
" The MBS market is very important:   It’s closely linked to the Treasury market , and it’s the way that our monetary policy decisions flow through to borrowers in the real econom y."
" Monetary policy has a role , and it really is in , you know —our original role was providing liquidity to financial systems when they’re under stress , and that’s—that ’s really part of what we did today."
" The other role is to suppor t demand through lower interest rates, and we did that."
" In your statement, you say that the market measures of inflation have declined ."
" The Fed has undershot inflation in the last year , and that ’s become one of the focuses of the FOMC meeting s."
" Now, does the Federal Reserve see deflation coming , and is this large cut meant to get in front of any  more inflation?"
"  So, on—on inflation, you know , the—the econom y’s performed so well, really , over the last few years , and right up through January :  historically low unemployment —50year-low unemployment for a couple of years, 11 years —almost 11 years of expansion so far , and yet inflation lingered below 2 percent."
 So we ’ve been concerned that inflation not move down further.
" It was a question of not getting inflation up to our target on a robust, symmetric kind of a way."
" So, with this coronavirus arriving, we judge d that the —the  net effects of this will be to —to have inflation move down e ven a little bit more."
" Again, it ’s just an issue of inflation probably falling even a bit further."
" So you see —and I think you ’ll see —as these purchases roll forward, you will see the T reasury market and the MBS market returning to normal market function , and that will actually support economic activity."
 That will be a positive for economic activity.
" And the same with the interest rate cut to zero —how long do you think that might last, a nd March 15, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference Call   FINAL   Page 11 of 21   would you be inclined to quickly go back to a higher level, the 100 basis points or more that you cut it from?"
" As far as —as the policy rate, what we ’ve said is that we  will maintain the rate at this level until we ’re confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals."
" And if you—if you  look at it, you’ ll see that some things have to happen March 15, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference Call   FINAL   Page 12 of 21   before we’ d consider —we’d have to become confident of —that the economy has weathered these recent events and also is on track to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals."
 It’s just that —like that for us with monetary policy.
" We have sole responsibility for monetary policy and strong instructions from Congress to conduct it in an independent, nonpolitical way."
 And you’ ve talked a bit about the —the disruptions from the coronavirus outbreak and having lower economic activity for a period of time.
" Our interest rates will matter —cuts will matter now to borrowers who will get some relief from our cuts , but they ’ll March 15, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference Call   FINAL   Page 18 of 21   matter a lot more when the economy begins to recover."
