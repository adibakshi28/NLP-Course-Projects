" Our decision to make another gradual reduction in the amount of policy accommodation reflects the progress the economy has made, and is expected to make, toward maximum employment and price stability objectives assigned to us by law."
" I ’ll have more to say about our interest rate decision and our balance sheet policy, but first I ’ll review recent economic developments and the outlook."
"Following a slowdown in the first quarter, economic growth appears to have rebounded, resulting in a moderate pace of growth so far this year."
" Household spending, which was particularly soft earlier this year, has been support ed by solid fundamentals, including ongoing improvement in the job market and relatively high levels of consumer sentiment and wealth."
" And exports have shown greater stre ngth this year, in part reflecting a pickup in global growth."
" In the labor market, job gains have averaged about 160,000 per month since the start of the year —a solid rate of growth that, although a little slower than last year, remains well above June 14, 2017  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 2 of 23   estimates of the pace necessary to absorb new entrants to the labor force."
" The unemployment rate has fallen about ½ percentage point since the beginning of the year and was 4.3 percent in May, a low level by historical standards and modestly below the median of FOMC participants ’ estimates of its longer -run normal level."
" Looking ahead, w e expect that the job market will strengthen somewhat further."
"Turning to inflation, the 12month change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures was 1.7 percent in April, up from less than 1 percent last summer but down somewhat over the past few months."
 Core inflation—which excludes the volatile food and energy categories and tends to be a better indicator of future inflation—has also edged lower.
" The recent lower readings on inflation have  been driven significantly by what appear to be one -off reductions in certain categories of prices, such as wireless telephone services and prescription drugs."
" These price declines will, as a matter of arithmetic, restrain the 12 -month inflation figures until the extraordinarily low March reading drops out of the calculation."
" However, with employment near its maximum sustainable level and the labor market continuing to strengthen, the Committee still expects inflation to move up and stabilize around 2 per cent over the next couple of years, in line with our longer -run objective."
" Nonetheless, in light of the softer recent inflation readings, the Committee is monitoring inflation developments closely."
" As always, participants conditioned their projections on their own individual views June 14, 2017  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 3 of 23   of appropriate monetary policy , which, in turn, depend on each participant ’s assessment of the many factors that shape the outlo ok."
" The median projection for growth of inflationadjusted gross domestic product , or real GDP , is 2.2 percent this year and edges down to 1.9 percent by 2019, slightly above its estimated longer -run rate."
" The median projection for the unemployment rate stands at 4.3 percent in the fourth quarter of this year and ticks down to 4.2 percent in 2018 and 2019, modestly below the median estimate of its longer -run normal rate."
" Finally, the median inflation projection is 1.6 percent this year and rises to 2 per cent in 2018 and 2019."
" Compared with the projections made in March, real GDP growth is little changed, the unemployment rate follows a moder ately lower path, and inflation—alt hough marked down this year for reasons I mentioned earlier —is unchanged over the following two years."
" In addition, the median estimate of the longer -run normal unemployment rate moved down a tenth to 4.6 percent."
" Returning to monetary policy, for the past year and a half the FOMC has been gradually increasing its target range for th e federal funds rate as the economy has continued to make progress toward our goals of maximum employment and price stability."
We continue to expect that the ongoing strength of the economy will warrant gradual increases in the federal funds rate to sustain a healthy labor market and stabilize inflation around our 2 percent longer -run objective.
 This view is consistent with participants ’ projections of appropriate monetary policy.
" By limiting the volume of securities that private inve stors will have to absorb as we reduce our holdings, the caps should guard against outsized moves in interest rates and other potential market strains."
" I can ’t tell you what the longer -run normal level of reserve balances will be because that will depend on the Committee ’s eventual decisions about how to implement monetary policy most efficiently and effectively in the longer run, as well as a number of as -yet unknown elements, including the banking syst em’s future demand for reserves and various factors that may affect the daily supply of reserves."
" As readers of our minutes know, the Committee has on previous occasions discussed potential long -run frameworks for implementing monetary policy."
" And because our current system is likely compatible with a much smaller quantity of reserves, our plan for gradually reducing our balance sheet does not constrain the Committee ’s future options for how to implement monetary policy."
" Finally, as noted in today ’s addendum, the Committee affirmed that changing the target range for the federal funds rate is our  primary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy."
" In other words, the balance sheet is not intended to be an active tool for monetary policy in normal times."
" More generally, the Committee would be prepared to use its full range of tools, including altering the size and composition of its balance sheet, if future economic conditions were to warrant a more accommodative monetary policy than can be achieved solely by reducing the federal funds rate."
" Chair Yellen, the principles you released today say the balance sheet wind -down should commence once interest rate normalization is “ well under  way.”  With this latest rate increase, do you believe normalization is now well under  way?"
" We ’ve now had a very long streak of —or fairly long streak of wea k inflation numbers , at least measured by the CPI th is morning as well."
 Marketplace -based inflation expectations are declining.
  What kind of vigilance are you now saying is needed in terms of wea k inflation?
 How do you think about thos e two potential responses to wea k inflation?
" We indicated in our statement  today that we ’re closely monitoring inflation developments and certainly have taken note of the fact that there have been several weak readings , particular ly on core inflation."
 Our statement indicates that we expect inflation to remain low in the near te rm.
" But , on the other hand, we continue to feel that with a strong labor market  and a labor market that ’s continuing to strengthen, the conditions are in place for inflation to move up."
" Now, obviously we need to monitor that very carefully  and ensure , especially with roughly five years o f inflation running under our 2 percent  objective —that is a goal to which the committee is strongly committed."
" And we need to make sure that we have in place the policies that are necessary to achieve 2 percent  inflation , and I pledge that we  will do that."
" But let me say , with respect to recent readings, i t’s important not to overreact to a few readings , and data on inflation can be noisy."
" As I pointed out, there have been some idiosyncratic factors I think that have held down inflation in recent months, particularly a  huge decline in cell telephone service plan prices, some declines in prescription drugs."
" We hav e a very strong labor market, an un employment rate that’s declined to levels we ha ve not seen since 2001."
" And , even with some modera tion in the pace of job growth, we have a labor market that continues to strengthen and policy remains —remains  accommodative."
" So, I —it’ s important that inflation move up to our 2 percent objective , as our projections  show we cont inue to expect that and be lieve  the conditions are in place."
" Hate to belabor the point on inflation, but I was wondering, I hear a lot of the socalled NAIRU in your conversation now and in other committee members ’."
" So I ’m wondering , something you’ ve talked about i s to focus more on the change in inflation —actual inflation , and is it going up or is it going down , and basing policy more on that."
" Well, we are closely looking at the actual performance of inflation and altering our views on the basis of discrepancies between what we see and our expectations."
" And, well, it is very difficult to pin down what is the longer -run normal rate of unemployment , and there ’s a great deal of uncertainty about it , and it ’s hard to pin down, especially given the June 14, 2017  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 10 of 23   fact that the so -called Phillips curve  appears to be quite flat."
 That means that inflation doesn ’t respond very much or very quickly to movements in unemployment.
" Now, in the face of very low unemployment that we have seen, while wage growth has picked up somewhat, it remains low , and inflation is influenced by a number of different factors , but we certainly haven ’t seen much or any evident upward pressure on inflation."
" In light of that, the C ommittee has successively moved down its estimate of the normal longer -run rate of unemployment , and in this projection, it’ s moved down to 4.6 percent , a tenth lower than it  was last time."
" So, while the unemployment rate is below that, it’ s not that much—it’ s not that much below it."
" Measures of financial cond itions show that since the F ed started raising interest rates two years ago, financial condi tions actually have loosened."
 We’re trying to generate paths for employment and inflation that meet our man dated objectives.
" So, on inflation again, I just wonder, what ’s the possibility that something more , sort of —I mean , nefarious is at work here, right, which is that the , sort of , weight of central bank credibility now —for a generation , really —plus globalization has just pushed the world into a low -inflation environment that ’s going to be June 14, 2017  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 12 of 23   very hard to get wages and prices moving again."
 We look at a whole variety of indicators of inflation expectations .
" Professional forecasters —whether it ’s in the B lue Chip or the S urvey of Professional F orecasters, those expectations have remained  quite steady and in close alignment with our 2 percent  inflation target."
 TIPS -based  measures of inflation compensation do not provide straight reads on market participants ’ estimates and expectations about inflation.
" It is true that some household surveys of  inflation expectations have moved down, but overall I wouldn’ t say that we ’ve seen a broad undermining of inflation expect ations."
" But you asked also, I guess , about have structural changes perhaps impacted the inflation process , and that certainly is possible."
 And estimates of the normal longer -run unemployment rate—they are quite uncertain.
" And, you know, I continue to believe, though, that with job growth running well in excess , even with the moderation of the level that ’s needed to provide for new entrants  in the labor market, we do have a strengthening economy ."
" But I think that that ’s a prudent  move , to move in a gradual way to remove accommodation , with unemplo yment now —and not only , I should say , the unemployment rate , but I think any indicator of labor market performance and  tightness that you could look at , whether it ’s household perceptions  of the availability of jobs, difficulty that firms report in hiring workers, the rate at which workers are quitting their jobs, the rate of job openings , all of these indicators do signal a tight labor mar ket."
"Now, with inflation below 2 percent , I think it’ s appropriate that the labor market be that tight."
" But we are attentive to the fact that inflation is running below our 2 percent objective , that we ’ve faced that  situation now for a long time , and it’ s really quite essential that we put in place policies that will succeed in moving inflation back to our 2 percent objective , and it ’s a symmetric objective."
" The C ommittee believes we have conditions in place for inflation to move up, but that ’s also a risk ."
" Recently, a group of economists sent  the F ed a letter earlier this  month disagreeing with your 2 percent  inflation target and saying they would like the economy to run a bit hotter."
" So, at  the time that we adopted the 2 percent  target —it was back in 2012—we had a very thorough discussion of the factors that should determine what our inflation objective should be."
" And we recognize the fact that inflation has been running below , and it ’s essential for us to move inflation back to that objective."
" So it ’s that recognition that causes  people to think we might be better off with a higher inflation objective, and that ’s an important set—this is one of our most critical decision s and one we are attentive to evidence and outside thinking."
" But a reconsideration of that objective needs to take account not only of benefits of a higher in— potential benefits of a higher inflation target, but also the potential cost s that could be associated with it."
" But  I would say that this is one of the most important questions facing monetary policy around the world in the future , and we very much look forward to seeing research by economists that will help inform our future decisions on this."
" The Treasury Secretary and others have suggested that DoddFrank regulation and the way it ’s been impl ied—applied have restricted credit growth in the economy, banks are not making loans that they otherwise would, and that has slowed growth."
" Well, with respect to the impact of c redit con ditions and bank regulation on slow growth, I ’ve previously , in testifying , indicated that I don ’t think that our regulations have played an important role , at least broadly speaking , in impeding credit growth and the growth of the economy."
" And I ’ve pointed in the past to a number of statistics suggesting that cred it growth continues to be  healthy, including among small —smaller community banks that are most concerned with regulatory burden."
" I think when banks are undercapitalized and weak, that i mpedes credit growth."
 And the characterization of you as a low  interest rate person?
" Well, I have felt that it’ s been appropriate for interest rates to remain low for a very long time."
" We are in the process of , as the economy strengthens , normalizing interest rates."
" But, certainly, we ’ve had a lot of years in which interest rates have been low."
" In light of the plans to trim the balance sheet hopefully later this year, what have you learned about QE and your bondbuying policies as a tool for monetary policy ?"
" When they were launched, it wasn ’t something June 14, 2017  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 21 of 23   you had, you know, engaged in on that scale before—a lot of fear s that  it was going to create hyperinflation ."
" I think the general conclusion is that it has worked in that it has put some downward pressure on longer -term interest rates, so -called ter m premiums embedded in longer -term interest rates."
" But , obviously, it has not caused runaway inflation, quite the contrary."
" It’s something that, if we were t o encounter an episode in the future of extreme weakness where —I’ve said we want the fed funds rate and movements in short -term interest rates, that’ s our goto number one main policy tool —but if we were to hit the zero lower bound and constrained in our use of that tool, certainly balance sheet policies and forward guidance of the type that we provided, I believe , based on the evidence of how they worked, ought to remain part of our toolkit."
