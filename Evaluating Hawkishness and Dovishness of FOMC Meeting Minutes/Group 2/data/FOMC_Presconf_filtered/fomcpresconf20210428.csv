" At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed to achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us:  maximum employment and price stability."
 Today my colleagues on the FOMC and I kept interest rates near zero and maintained our sizable ass et purchases.
" These measures, along with our strong guidance on interest rates and on our balance sheet, will ensure that monetary policy will continue to deliver powerful support to the economy until the recovery is complete."
" Since the beginning of the year, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened."
" As with overall economic activity, conditions in the labor market have continued to improve ."
" Employment rose 916,000 in March , as the leisure and hospitality sector poste d a notable gain for the second consecutive month."
" Nonetheless, employment in this sector is still more than 3 million below its level at the onset of the pandemic."
" For the economy as a whole, payroll employment is 8.4 million below its pre -pandemic level."
" The unemployment rate remain ed elevated at 6 percent in March , and this figure understates the shortfall in employment, particularly as participation in the labor market remains notably below pre -pandemic levels."
" In the near term, 12month measures of PCE inflation are expected to move above 2 percent as the very low readings from early in the pandemic  fall out of the calculation  and past increases in oil prices pass through to consumer energy prices ."
" However, these one -time increases in prices are likely to have only transitory  effects on inflation."
" April 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  Page 3 of 29   The Fed ’s response to this crisis has been guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to promote the stability of the financial system."
" As we say in our Stat ement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, we view maximum employment as a broadbased and inclusive goal."
 Our ability to achieve maximum employment in the years ahead depends importantly on having longer -term inflation expectations well anch ored at 2 percent.
" As the Committee reiterated in today ’s policy statement, with inflation running persistently below 2 percent, we will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and lo ngerterm inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent."
 We expect to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these employment and inflation outcomes are achieved.
" With regard to interest rates, we continue to expect it will be appropriate to maintain the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee ’s assessment of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time."
 I would note that a transitory rise in inflation above 2 percent this year would not meet this standard.
" In addition, we will continue to increase our holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 bill ion per month and of agency mortgage -backed securities by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward our maximum -employment and price -stability goals."
" April 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  Page 4 of 29   Our guidance for interest rates and asset p urchases ties the path of the federal funds rate and the size of the balance sheet to our employment and inflation goals."
 This outcome -based guidance will ensure that the stance of monetary policy remains highly accommodative as the recovery progresses.
 Economic activity and hiring have just recently picked up after slowing over the winter.
" But, you know, we ’ve articulated particular guidance for tapering our asset purchases and for lifting off and raising interest rates."
" For interest rates, as I—as I  said a moment ago, we want to see labor market conditions consistent with maximum employment , we want to see inflation at 2  percent , and we want to see it on track to exceed 2 percent ."
 I wonder if you could talk a little bit about that test for raising interest rates that you just elaborated.
 But I guess I wonder what happens if inflation expectations were to move up before you see some sort of return to full employmen t.
" You know, it seems like a lot of sort of the stability in inflation has been tied to the fact that those have been so low and stable, and I guess I wonder how , how  your reaction would be—sort of how your reaction to that is , is—how you’ re thinking about that."
" So it seems unlikely, frankly, that we would see inflation moving up in a persistent way that would actually move inflation expectations up while there was still significant slack in the labor market."
 It ’s much more likely that we would —having achieved maximum -employment conditions —we ’d also be seeing 2  percent  inflation and be on track to see inflation moving above 2 percent .
" So that ’s not to say inflation won’ t—might not move up, but for inflation to move up in a persistent way that , that  really starts to move inflation expectations up, that would have to —that would take some time ."
" Mr. Chairman, I want to follow up on Jonnelle ’s question, and I wonder if you can help us understand better your thinking about how COVID infection rates and the virus calibrate with monetary policy."
" We’ re, we’re  really focused on the economic outcomes, and, again, my , my guess is that we— it’s very likely, it seems to me, that for us to achieve the economic outcomes, we would need to taper or to raise interest rates."
"  I wanted to ask, you ’ve talked a lot during this crisis about the need to have a lot of help from fiscal policy and monetary policy to make sure that there ’s not longterm scar ring in the economy ."
" Notwithstanding that, we ’re a long way from full employment."
" And so, while I would say we haven ’t seen really highly elevated levels of unemployment for —you know, up in the teens that we thought we  might have for an extended period of time, we ’ve still got a lot of people who are out to —out of work."
"  It’s, it’s partly because there’ s, there’s  clearly strong demand, and there ’s just not a lot of supply right now."
" So builders are, you know, struggling to keep up wi th the demand, clearly."
" And, you know, my hope would be that , over time, housing builders can react to this demand and, and come up with more supply and workers will come back to work in that industry."
" So I think there are a number  of—a number  of things going on there :  the tension between a hi gh level of unemployment and yet many, many companies saying they can’ t find —an elevated number of companies saying that they can’ t find workers."
" B ut I do think that —and I do think also that unemployment insurance benefits will run out in September, so to the extent that ’s a factor, which is not clear , it will no longer be a factor fairly soon."
" So my guess is, it will come back to this e conomy where we have, you know, equilibrium between labor supply and labor demand."
" I wanted to ask you, you know , you’ ve been hearing, of course, these concerns r aised by Larry Summers and others about inflation and the fact that they think the Fed  might be —might let things get out of hand with the new policy stance."
" So my question is , can you tell us , what is different this time versus previous periods like in the  ’60s when inflation got out of control ?"
" Why are you confident with, April 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  Page 13 of 29   with the lags in monetary policy that the Fed can get ahead of inflation and, and  make sure it doesn’ t go too far above the 2 percent  target?"
" S o I actually have a couple things I ’d like to say about inflation, including addressing your question."
 So let me start with just saying that we’re very strongly committed to achieving our objectives of maximum employment and price stability.
" Our , our price stability goal is 2  percent  inflation over the longer run, and we believe that having inflation average 2 percent  over time will help anchor longterm inflation expectations at 2 percent ."
" With inflation having run persistently below 2 percent  for some time , the Committee seeks inflation moderately above inflation for two times —above 2 percent  for some time."
" In the United States, fiscal and monetary policy continue to provide strong support :  Vaccinations are now widespread, and the economy is beginning to move ahead with real momentum."
" In an episode of one -time price increases as the economy reopens is not the same thing as, and is not likely to lead to , persistently higher year -overyear inflation into the future —inflation at levels that are not consistent with our goal of 2  percent  inflation over time."
" If, if , contrary to expectations, inflation were to move persistently and materially  above 2  percent  in a manner that threatened to move longer -term inflation expectations materially above 2  percent , we would use our tools to bring April 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  Page 14 of 29   inflation and expectations down to mandate -consistent levels."
 And we know that our job is to achieve 2 percent  inflation over time.
" So let me talk quickly about the two reasons —two , or you could say three, but really two main reasons why we think inflation will move up in the near term."
 Twelve -month measures of inflation are likely to move well above 2 percent  over the next few months as the very low inflation readings recorded in March and April of last year drop out of the calculation.
 These base effects will contribute about 1 percentage point to headline inflation and about 0.7 percentage point to core inflation in April and May.
 They carry no implication for the rate of inflation in later periods.
" We think of bottlenecks as things that, in their nature, will be resolved as workers and businesses adapt , and we think of them as not calling for a change in monetary policy since they’ re temporary and April 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  Page 15 of 29   expected to resolve themselves."
" A nd we are, we are focused —as you’ ve seen, for many years, we ’ve been focused on inflation deviating below 2 percent , and we used our tools aggressively to keep it back up at 2 percent ."
" If, if we see inflation moving materially above 2 percent  in a persistent way that risks inflation expectations drifting up, then we will use our tools to guide inflation and expectations back down to 2 percent ."
" And , on inflation, the FOMC said the rise in inflation we ’re beginning to see largely reflects transitory factors, as you just described ."
" It ’s not one really good employment reading, which is w hat we got in March."
" We’re 8½  million jobs below where we were in February  of 2020, and that doesn’ t account for growth in the labor force and growth in the economy, that trend we were on."
"  I mean, there are alway s—there are always relative prices going up and down within inflation."
" I wanted to ask you another question about inflation, and it has to do with inflation expectations."
" A n umber of different surveys and, and market indicators are showing, you know, multiyear highs in inflation expectations ratings."
" So I wonder ed, you know, if , if that was something that you saw consistent with your inflation outlook."
" Is that something that worries you, or do you see that  as, maybe, you know, the success of the F ed’s new inflation framework, you know, making it out to the , to the broader public?"
" Inflation expectations before the pandemic hit —and here we think of survey, market  based —survey being eith er households or , or economists and , and  market based."
" You look at all of those, and I would say that they were at the low end of what would have been consistent with a 2 percent  inflation target, particularly our 2  percent  inflation target, which calls f or 2 percent  average inflation."
" Inflation expectations actually went down a bit at the beginning of the pandemic, and now they’ ve just moved back up to levels broadly— that, that  are where they were in 2018 , or in some cases 2014 , and, I would say, more consistent with our mandate."
 We want inflation to run a little bit higher than it has been ru nning for the last quarter of a century.
" And for that, we need to see inflation expectations that are consistent with that, really well anchored at 2  percent ."
" We monitor inflation expectation s very, very carefully, as you would obviously know."
" Do you have any redlines on inflation readings  where if, you know, you hit , like, a  certain number on, say, you know, core PC E, that would be, you know, a trigger response from the F ed?"
" You know, we ’re, we’re —inflation measures are always going to be a bit volatile."
" We had it —we were in a deep, deep hole a year ago, and now, with a lot of help from fiscal policy, some additional help from monetary policy , and, you know, a great deal of help from vaccination, we ’re seeing a strong rebound in activity."
" And what ’s happening is , it’s, it’s—demand can be spurred with fiscal transfers and —the saved -up fiscal transfers and , and people going back to work and thin gs like that."
"  I won ’t say it has nothing to do with monetary policy, but it also—it has a tremendous amount to do with vaccination and reopening of the economy."
" There  were real concerns, of course, with high levels of unemployment and loss of wages and all of that , that the —that the  household sector would, would, would weaken dramatically."
" And it’s—by the way, I think it ’s appropriate and important for financial conditions to remain accommodative to support economic activity."
" As , as you know, at the very beginning of the financial —of the —of this recent crisis, there was such a demand for selling T reasuries, including by foreign central banks, that , really , the dealers couldn ’t handle the volume."
" And, along those lines, with the fiscal spending and the April 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  Page 26 of 29   accommodation you talked about with transitory inflation, does more spending need to be injected into the system, or will that affect that transitory nation —nature of the inflation?"
 When can it stand without having that support from the monetary policy side?
" With all the fiscal spending that’ s happened and the accommodation and —does , does  the system need more spending either from the fiscal side or accommodation , or would more spending affect the transitory nature of the inflation and put those upward, upward pressures on inflation long term?"
" We, we  have tri ed to create accommodative financial conditions to support economic activity, and we did that."
" That will be the test for , for tapering asset purchases and for raising interest rates."
