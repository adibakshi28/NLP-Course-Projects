 We do this by steadfastly pursuing the goals that Congress has given us :  maximum employment and stable prices.
 Today we decided to lower the interest rates for the third time this year.
" Household spending continues to be strong, supported by a healthy job market, rising incomes, and solid consumer confidence."
 Sluggish growth abroad and trade developments have been weighing on those sectors.
 The job market remains strong.
 The unemployment rate has been near h alfcentury lows for a year and a half.
 This underscores for us the importance of sustaining the expansion so that the strong job market rea ches more of those left behind.
 Inflation continues to run below our symmetric 2 percent objective.
" Over the 12 months through August, total PCE inflation was 1.4 percent and core inflation was 1.8 percent."
" Inflation pressures remain muted, and indicators of longer -term inflation expectations are at the lower end of their historic ranges."
 We’re mindful  that continued below -target inflation could lead to an unwelcome downward slide in longterm inflation expectations.
" However, against the backdrop of a strong economy and supportive monetary policy, we expect inflation will rise to 2 percent."
" Overall, we  continue to see sustained expansion of economic activity, a strong labor market, and inflation near our symmetric 2 percent objective as most likely."
" While this has been our outlook for quite some time, our views about the path of interest rates that wil l best achieve these outcomes have changed significantly over the past year."
" As I mentioned, weakness in global growth and trade developments have weighed on the economy and pose ongoing risks."
" These factors, in conjunction with muted inflation pressures , have led us to lower our assessment of the appropriate level of the federal funds rate over the past year."
" Since monetary policy operates with a lag, the full effects of these adjustments on economic growth, the job market, and inflation will be realized over time."
"  We see the current stance of monetary policy as likely to remain appropriate as long as incoming information about the economy remains broadly consistent with our outlook of moderate economic growth, a strong labor market, and inflation near our symmetric 2 percent objective."
" We believe monetary policy October 30, 2019   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 3 of 24  is in a good place to achieve these outcomes."
 Let me end with a few  words about our technical monetary policy operations.
" In January, we made the key decision to continue to implement monetary policy in an ample -reserves regime."
 These actions are purely technical measures to support the effective implementation of monetary policy as we continue to learn about the appropriate level of reserves.
 They do not represent a change in the stance of monetary policy.
" In those programs, we purchased longer -term securities to  put downward pressure on longer -term interest rates and ease broader financial conditions."
" In contrast, October 30, 2019   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 4 of 24  increasing the supply of reserves by purchasing Treasury bills only alters the mix of short -term assets held by the public and should not materially a ffect demand and supply for longer -term securities or financial conditions more broadly."
" The performance of the economy has been —particularly the household sector —has been strong, has been resilient , with low unemployment, attractive levels of job creation, wages moving up, l abor force participation moving up, household confidence, and solid gains in many measures of consumer spending."
" But, overall, we ’ve seen moderate gro wth, a strong labor market, inflation moving up."
" It’ s for moderate growth, a strong labor market, and inflation near our 2 perce nt objective."
" So , in terms of risks, what I was referring to there —the principal risks that we ’ve been monitoring have been, really , slowing global growth  and trade policy developments  as well as muted inflat ion pressure."
" What we ’ve had is an economy where the consumer is really driving growth , and, you know, personal consumption expenditures were almost 3 percent  in this quarter —in this first reading for the quarter."
" I mean , there ’s this concern that I sometimes hear that , with business , businesses have cut investment , and are they going to turn around and cut employment?"
" U nemployment has declined again, and the household survey is now at a 50year low —has been, you know, very close to 50year low s for 18 months now."
" The consumer -facing companies that we talk to in our vast network of contacts report, you know, that consumers are doing well and are focused on, October 30, 2019   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 7 of 24  you know, the good job market and rising incomes, and that ’s their principle focus."
 Wh at would make you guys decide it ’s appropriate to raise interest rates again?
" So the reason why we raised interest rates is because —generally is because we see inflation as moving up —or, in danger of moving up significantly, and we really don’t see that now."
 Inflation moved down in the first quarter of this year.
"And inflation expectations have also kind of moved down and sideways —both surveys and market based over the course of this —of, really , the recent mont hs."
" And, you know, we think that inflation expectations are very important in driving actual inflation, and we ’re strongly committed to achieving our 2 percent  inflation objective on a symmetric basis."
" So we think that the current stance of policy is likely to remain appropriate —likely to remain appropriate —as long as incoming information about the economy is broadly consistent with our outlook, which is a positive one of moderate economic growth, strong labor market, and inflation moving close to 2 percent ."
" You described the recent sl ide, Chair Powell, in inflation expectations as “unwelcome."
"”  You said that inflation expectations are “very important .”  What, if anything, would the C ommittee be prepared to do to address this slide in inflation expectations if it continued?"
" So, as I mentioned, we do think that inflation expectations are —they’ re quite essential, quite central in our framework of how we think about inflati on."
 We need them to be anchored in a level —at a level that ’s consistent with our symmetric 2  percent  inflation goal.
"We’re also, as part of our  review, looking at potential innovations, changes to the way we think about things, changes to the framework that would lead us —that would be more supportive of achieving inflation on a 2 percent —on a symmetric 2  percent  basis over time."
 But we ’re in the middle of thinking about ways that we can make that symmetric 2  percent  inflation objective more credible by achieving symmetric 2 percent  inflation.
" And it comes down to using your policy tools to achieve 2 percent  inflation, and that is the —that is the  thing that must happen for credibility in this area."
" These are—you know, these changes to monetary policy frameworks happen —they don’ t happen really quickly, let ’s say."
 Inflation targeting took many years to evolve.
" So how big of a change, then, to monetary policy would there be if you get some of that uncertainty cleared up —specifically , the phase -one China trade deal finished and  USMCA ratified?"
" How big of a change could that be to the monetary policy as it stands here, and could we see rate cuts next year —or, rate hikes next year ?"
" So could there be a point, or how —I guess my question is , how big of an impact on monetary policy would removing that uncertainty  be?"
"  I wouldn’ t expect that the effects on activity or confidence would be immediate , or—wo uld there  be immediate effects i n economic activity."
 So that ’s really about inflation .
 So I think we would need to see a really significant move up in inflation that ’s persistent before we would consider raising rates to address inflation concerns.
 You have a synchronized slowdown in economic activity around the globe.
" And we ’ve had inflation, which—we ’ve called  out the risk of inflation running persistently below 2 percent  as a risk that we needed to address."
" That continues, but nonetheless, overall, we ’ve got an economy that is showing moderate growth, and we think that today’ s setting —we’re now  at 1.5 to 1.75 percent ."
" We also see now, I think, more clearly the effects of more accommodative monetary policy on various kinds of consumer activity."
" You ’re seeing housing now contributing to growth for the first time in a while —twotenths, I think , this quarter."
" A nd I think, more broadly, monetary policy is also supporting household spending and home  buying by keeping the labor market strong, keeping workers ’ incomes rising, and keeping consumer confidence at high levels , where it currently is."
" Well , I think monetary policy works  through the channels that we understand."
" I think it ’s—I think interest rates are a factor in business investment, but I don’ t believe they ’re the main factor and main driver ."
" And, you know, there ’s a lot of monetary policy accommodation and some fiscal  accommodation , maybe , in the global economy now."
 And that should turn —that should support growth in the global economy.
" You mentioned Fed Listens a couple  of times, and what you’ ve heard from people there about how it ’s benefited  the disadvantaged or lower -income workers —the h ot job market we have."
" In fact, I would imagine that this entire monetary policy review will become institutionalized and be done every few years."
" That ’s why we —you know, we talk about how low the unemployment rate is, the aggregate unemployment, but we also talk about groups that haven’ t experienced that yet ."
" When you look at that, do you believe that you have achieved a soft landing or are achieving a soft landing, in the sense that we’ re moving to trend growth for the rest of the year and next year?"
" So that is —our outlook overall is for moderate growth of around 2 percent , which is pretty close to trend ."
 I strongly believe that the actions we’ve taken over the course of this year have been the right things to do for this economy and are supporting economic growth and will do so in the future .
" You know, it ’s—monetary policy is famously a blunt instrument ."
" So we can ’t—obviously, we can’ t raise interest rates some place and lower them other places."
" The first thing to know is to understand that , that—and we ’ve called that out, as you, I’m sure , know, in one of our recent Monetary Policy Report s to Congress ."
" The sort of rural –urban disparities in —you know, in employment, in growth, in all kinds of things, in health outcomes."
" Let me p ut it this way :  We do what we do, which is , we’re assigned a job , which is maximum employment and stable prices."
" The U.S. economy faces significant longer -term challenges around potential growth, around labor force participation, around disparities of income and wealth, around all kinds of things ."
" But if you really w ant the U.S. economy to be all it can be and raise the potential growth rate of the United States, you need—you need proper monetary policy."
" But, really, it isn ’t monetary policy ."
" Really , it’s fiscal policy that supports, you know, inclusive growth."
" But, given the ups and downs of the trade  dispute and that, you know, several truces and tentative deals have fallen through, are you concerned about developing monetary policy guidance, if you will, that ’s dependent a  good part on the wins of the trade negotiations ?"
" If I could follow up, if the phase -one agreem ent, then , doesn’ t work out, then would we be back at, you know, making, you know, monetary policy that— CHAIR POWELL."
 The Fed has pointed out many times in the past the rising inequality over those past decades and how that could be a factor behind sluggish growth.
" In light of the recent outcome of the strike at General Motors, do you see the union having a role to play, helping to raise lower and middle incomes and promoting more shared growth in  the long run ?"
" I will just say , on the General Motors strike, it’s —it’ s likely to have taken away a couple of tenths of growth this quarter."
" Wondering if you would categorize the current s tance of  monetary policy as accommodative, or if it ’s just, you know, that neutral was lower than we thought at this time last year."
" So, given your mention of fiscal policy and the role it plays in supporting longterm growth, you know, is it fair to say that the T ax Cuts and J obs A ct worked the way it was supposed to?"
" Given this sustained level of low  inflation, even October 30, 2019   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 23 of 24  in—even in this country, do you think—so the re seems to be a higher possibility that lower inflation expectation s will remain going forward."
" So do you think a Japan -like situation , or “Japanification ” of chronically low inflation and interest rates —the U.S. is getting trapped by the  Japanification of this situation ?"
" So we —we , of course, have watched the situation in Japan and now the situation in Europe, and we —we note that there are significant disinflationary pressures around the world."
" But, of course, if you look at our current inflation performance, it hasn’ t been anything like what we ’ve seen in those other places."
" But we don’ t think —again, we don’ t think we ’re exempt from those pressures, and we are, therefore, st rongly committed to having inflation expectations anchored at the level that is consistent with the symmetric 2  percent  inflation objective ."
It’s not —the risk isn ’t that inflation might run a couple tenths below 2 percent.
" The risk is that what we ’ve seen is other economies getting on a disinflationary path, that  it’s been very hard for them to get off ."
" Once inflation expectations start slidin g down, inflation moves down."
" You have less —interest rates move down as well , because there’ s an inflation component in interest rates ."
" And, you know, we think that the right thing to do is to do what we can now to hold and really move inflation expectat ions up so that they’ re squarely and firmly anchored at a level that ’s consistent with 2  percent  inflation ."
