" Before we get to questions, I ’ll summarize today ’s policy action by the Federal Open Market Committee  and then I ’ll place the Committee ’s policy decision in the context of our economic outlook and our collective judgment regarding the appropriate path of monetary policy ."
 Most Committee  participants expect economic growth to remain moderate over coming quarters and then to pick up gradually .
"  April 25, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL    2 of 23  Labor market conditions have improved in recent months , with the unemployment rate having fallen nearly a percentage point since August ."
" However, at 8.2 percent, the unemployment rate remains elevated ."
" Looking ahead, the Committee  anticipates that  the unemployment rate will decline gradually over the next several years , reflecting the moderate pace of economic growth ."
" Specifically, participants ’ projections for the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of this year have a central tendency of 7.8 to 8.0 percent , declining to 6.7 to 7.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2014."
" For comparison, participants ’ estimates of the longer -run normal rate of unemployment have a central tendency of 5.2 to 6.0 percent ."
"  Inflation has  picked up somewhat , mainly reflecting higher gasoline prices ."
" Moreover, survey measures and financial market indicators continue to show stability in longer -term inflation expectations ."
" Consequently, we anticipate that inflation will subsequently run at or below the Committee ’s longer -run goal of 2 percent ."
" In particular, participants ’ projections of inflation have a central tendency of 1.9 to 2.0 percent for 2012 and 1.7 to 2.0 percent for 2014."
  The economic  projection s submitted by FOMC participants are conditioned on their individual assessments of the appropriate path of monetary policy .
" In particular, a highly accommodative stance of April 25, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL    3 of 23  monetary policy is warranted in light of the  persistence of the factors restraining the pace of recovery and the ongoing risks  to the economic outlook."
" Some of your critics —I’m sure you ’re not going to be surprised—think that you’ re still being too cautious , that unem ployment is still high, the economy may be slowing, inflation is subdued, and  I know you just talked about the balance  sheet ."
" Well , first, the Comm ittee has certainly been bold and aggressive in terms of easing monetary policy ."
"  So we ha ve been very accommodative , and we remain prepared to do more as needed to make sure that this recovery continues and that inflation stays close  to target."
" So , in particular, we will continue to assess, you know, looking at the economic outlook, looking at the risks , whether or not unemployment is making sufficient progress towards its  longer -run normal level, and whether inflation is remaining c lose to target ."
 The Fed has been forecasting for some time that inflation would fall to 2 percent or below .
 The latest measures of inflation suggest that the core PC E is at the higher end of that range and many other measures are above 2 percent .
 Do you see a risk that the disinflationary forces in the economy might not be as strong as the Fed had been projecting for some time?
" Well, I would just say , first, that our projections still have inflation  very close to our 2 percent target ."
" As you point out, core inflation and some other measures of underlying  inflation ha ve been a little stronger than expected ."
" And the fundamentals of inflation—in particular, inflation expectations ; the amount of slack in the economy ; the commodity price behavior , which has been relatively well -controlled in recent mont hs—all of those things suggest that inflation is going to stay close to or perhaps a bit below our 2 percent target ."
" Now, as I mentioned in the opening remarks and as we said in our briefing, the recent rise in gasoline prices has created a temporary bulg e in headline inflation, in overall inflation, but we expect that to pass through the system and , assuming no new shocks in the oil sector, inflati on ought to moderate to about 2 percent later this year."
" The lower bound rose —again, this represents 17 distinct views —but I would guess that the reason is that the data have come in a little bit firmer , core April 25, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL    5 of 23  inflation has been a little stronger than was expected ."
" And I can o nly say qualitatively that the Committee  will continue to look at the evolution of the outlook, try to assess whether unemployment is making sufficient progress towards our objectives , and , in particular , whether the recovery is still April 25, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL    6 of 23  continuing ."
 And we remain prepared to use balance sheet tools to support the recovery and to help make sure that unemployment continues its downward path towards longer -run normal levels.
" Unemployment is too high, and you said you expect it to remain too high for years to come ."
" Inflation is under control , and you say that you expect it to remain under control ."
" The second point that I made was that when short -term interest rates hit zero, the tools of a central bank are no longer —are not exhausted, there are still other things that the central bank can do to create additional accommodation ."
" When deflation became a significant risk in late 2010 , or at least a modest risk in late 2010, we used additional balanc e sheet tools to help return inflation close to the 2 percent target ."
"situation today is that Japan was in deflation , April 25, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL    8 of 23  and, clearly , when you’ re in deflation and in recession, then both sides of your mandates, so to speak, are demanding additional accommodation."
" In thi s case , it’s—we are not in deflation, we have an inflation rate that ’s close to our objective ."
" I guess the question is, does it make sense to actively seek a higher inflation rate in order to achieve a slightly increased reduction —a slightly increased pace of reduction in the unem ployment rate ?"
" We have—we, the Federal Reserve, have spent 30 years building up credibility for low and stable inflation , which has proved extremely valuable in that we ’ve been be able to take strong accommodative actions in the last four  or five  years to support the economy without leading to a n unanchoring of inflation expectations or a destabilization of inflation."
" In today ’s statement you said , after coming quarters, you expect the econom y “to pick up gradually .”  Yet in the forecast that we got today, we see the forecast for 2013 and 2014, the growth forecast , is downgraded."
" So the basic feature that is described in our statement , which is that growth seems likely to pick up over time , is still obviously in our projections ."
" And the reason for that expected pickup over  time is , first , a very accommodative monetary policy , which continues to provide support for the recovery ."
" But in addition, some of the headwinds that have been affecting our recovery —such as the housing market, financial stresses, credit tightness, and so on—some of those things we hope will be lifting over  time and will allow the economy to grow more quickly and approach more quickly its longer -run full employment level ."
" Mr. Chairman, you’ ve made th e inflation t arget  sound a little bit more like an inflation ceiling , and you suggested that a b reaching of that ceiling or target would hurt the Fed ’s credibility ."
" Can you explain a little bit more about why you think going 50 basis points or a full perc entage point  above the 2 percent target would hurt the Fed’ s credibility , and what that would do on the unemployment side if you were to do that?"
" So it ’s not a ceiling, it’ s a symmetric objective , and we attempt to bring inflation close  to 2 percent ."
" And in particular, if inflation were to jump for whatever reason —and we don’ t have, obviously don’ t have perfect control of inflation—we ’ll try to return inflation to 2 percent at a pace which takes into account the situation with respect to unemployment ."
" The risk of higher inflation— you say 2½ percent ; well, 2 ½ percent expected change might involve a distribution of outcome s, some of which might be much higher than 2½ percent ."
" And the concern we have is that if inflation were to run well  above 2 percent for a protracted period , that the credibility and the wellanchored inflation expectations , which are such a valuable asset of the Federal Reserve, might become eroded , in which case we would in fact have less rather than more flexibility to use accommodat ive monetary policy to achieve our employment goals ."
" She showed there some so -called optimal policy rules that come from trying to get the best possible outcomes from our quantitative econometric models , and what  you see, if you look at that, is that the best possible outcomes, assuming perfect certainty, assuming perfect foresight—very unrealistic assumptions —still April 25, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL    11 of 23  involve inflation staying quite close to 2 percent ."
 So there is no presumption even in our econometric models that you need inflation well above target in or der to make progress on unemployment.
" First, to follow up on Steve ’s point about the interest rate forecast earlier:  There are now only four FOMC participants who forecast that rates will still be close to zero at the end of 2014."
" And as we discussed the range of considerations, including the fact that we remain uncertain about how the economy is going to evolve, I ’ve talked about, for example, the socalled Okun’ s law puzzle about whether or not unemployment will continue fall quickly or whether it will begin to level out."
 I think it was an important step to make clear what our inflation objective is —I thought that was important .
" One is to help make the Fed a little bit more understandable to the average person, because many people don’ t understand all the arcane aspects of the Federal Reserve and of monetary policy ."
" And also, to communicate with markets so that markets can better appreciate, you know, what our monetary policy plans are in order so that interest rates and other asset prices can appropriately reflect those plans ."
" And, you know, we ’ve seen, for example, less volatility in interest rates related to greater certainty about what the Fed is likely to do ."
"  We see monetary policy as being approximately in the right place at this point, based on the analysis that we’ ve been doing in —of the economy and  the outlook."
" Well, to your last point, the purpose of monetary policy is to achieve our object ives of maximum employment and price stability , it’s not to disappoint or April 25, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL    18 of 23  not disappoint investors ."
" The view that we have generally taken at the Fed , in which I think—for which I think the evidence is pretty good, is that it’ s the quantity of securities held by the Fed at a given time rather than the new purchases —the flow of new purchases —which is the primary determinant of interest rates ."
" And if that theory is correct, then at such time that our purchases come to an end, there should be relatively minim al effects on interest rates at that time ."
 And we need to continue to maintain a strong monetary policy support to make sure that the economy continues on a recovery path and returns to a more normal situation.
" Can you talk about why people are dropping out of the job market, whether it ’s a permanent structural problem , and what convinces you that things may ch ange?"
 I think that keeping interest rates low is still appropriate for our e conomy .
" As for the bond bubble, interest rates are low for a lot of reasons ; they include monetary policy , of course , but they also include a weak economy, low inflation expectations , and safe -haven demands for U.S. T reasuries ."
" So, of course , interest rates will rise at some point."
" But all that being said, I think , again , that there are both good reasons to continue monetary ease and good reasons for interest rates to be low ."
" Actually , we had a very good discussion of that at the meeting be cause it is an important issue , trying to assess how much of the change in employment is structural, how much is cyclical , and so on."
" Much of it is young people , for example, who presumably are not out of the labor force indefinitely , but, given the weak job market, they are going to school or doing something else rather than working ."
" So one possibility and one reason why the unemployment rate may not fall as quickly going forward is that as the economy strengthens, as the labor market strengthens, many of these folks are going to come back in the labor force looking for wor k, which I think would be a good thing ."
 Can you give us your assessment of the impact of the mild winter weather on job growth and what that might mean going forward?
" I mean, given those two things, what kind of job growth can we expect?"
"  April 25, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL    22 of 23  I advance d the hypothesis that the increase in employment we ’ve seen in the last five, six months might to some extent be greater than we’d expect going forward because it represented a onetime catch -up, undoing the very sharp layoffs in 2008 and 2009."
" If unemployment looks like it’ s no longer making progress, that ’ll be an important consideration in thinking about policy options."
" What kind of job growth, on average , is consistent with the unemployment projections that you ’ve made?"
" We need fewer jobs monthly to keep unemployment consistent or stable than in the past —I suppose more like 100,000 a month for stability ."
"  Again, that ’s not a forecast, I ’ve made a hypothesis, which would imply slower improvement in unemployment ."
" And as a result, here we are, almost three years from the beginning of the expansion, and the unemployment rate  is still over 8 percent ."
