" At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed to achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us —maximum employment and price stability."
" Today my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee and I made some important changes to our policy statement, including an update to our guidance for the likely path of our policy interest rate."
" Guided by our new Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy that we announced a f ew weeks ago, these changes clarify our strong commitment over a longer time horizon."
" Economic activity has picked up from its depressed secondquarter level, wh en much of the economy was shut down to stem the spread of the virus."
" The recovery in household spending also likely owes to federal stimulus payments and expanded unemployment  benefits, which provided substantial and timely support to household incomes."
" The recovery has progressed more quickly than generally expected, and forecasts from FOMC participants for economic growth this year have been revised up since our June Summary of September 16, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 2 of 32  Economic Projections."
 The unemployment rate declined over the past four months but remains elevated at 8.4 percent as of August.
" Looking ahead, FOMC participants project the unemployment rate to continue to decline; the med ian projection is 7.6 percent at the end of this year, 5.5 percent next year, and 4 percent by 2023."
 The pandemic  has also left a significant imprint on inflation.
" More broadly, however, weaker demand, especially in sectors that have been most affected by the pandemic, has held down consumer prices, and overall, inflation is running well below our 2 percent longer -run objective."
 The median inflation projection from FOMC participants rises from 1.2 percent this year to 1.7 percent next year and reaches 2 percent in 2023.
" The Fede ral Reserve’s response to this crisis has been guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to promote the stability of the financial system."
"The changes we made in today’s policy statement reflect our strategy to achieve our dual -mandate goals by seeking to eliminate shortfalls from maximum employment and achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time, as we articulated in our Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy."
 We view maximum employment as a broad -based and inclusive goal and do not see a high level of employment as posing a policy concern unle ss accompanied by signs of unwanted increases in inflation or the emergence of other risks that could impede the attainment of our goals.
 And we believe that achieving inflation that averages 2 percent over time helps ensure that longer -term inflation exp ectations remain well anchored at our longer -run 2 percent objective.
" In turn, well -anchored inflation expectations enhance our ability to meet both our employment and inflation objectives, particularly in the new normal in which interest rates are closer to their effective lower bound even in good times."
"September 16, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 4 of 32  Hence, as we say in our statement, with inflation running persistently below 2 percent, we “will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over  time and longer -term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent."
”  We expect “ to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomes ”—including maximum employment —“are achieved.
"”  With regard to interest rates, we now in dicate that we expect it will be appropriate to maintain the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate “ until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessments of maximum employment and inflation h as risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time."
" Of course, as we note in our policy statement, we “ would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could im pede the attainment of our [the Committee’s] goals.”  The Federal Reserve has also been taking broad and forceful actions to more directly support the flow of credit in the economy for households, for businesses large and small, and for state and local gove rnments."
" It will take a while to get back to the levels of economic activity and employment that prevailed at the beginning of this year, and it may take continued support from both monetary and fiscal policy to achieve that."
" Yo u’ve been very clear about the C ommittee ’s intention on rates, not even thinking about thinking about raising rates , and today showing low rates even as unemployment falls  to 4 percent  and inflation rises to 2  percent ."
" Effectively , we’re saying that rates will remain highly accommodative until the economy is far along in its recovery, and that, that  should be a very powerful statement in supporting economic activity."
 Or would they have to come in conjunction with an overheating on inflation or some sort of dramatic drop in the unemployment rate?
" And today we said that we ’d “be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of our [the Committee’s ] goals.”  But you asked specifically about , about  financial stability."
 One thing I would say is that financial —that monetary policy should not be the first line of defense —is not the first line of defense on financial stability.
" But we always leave open the idea that we will not ignore September 16, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 9 of 32  those kinds of risks and other kinds of risks , more broadly, that could impede the attainment of our goals in, in setting  monetary policy."
" So , you know, what we said again  in the [Statement on] L onger -Run [Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy] —you know, in our consensus statement is that we, you know —“policy decisions reflect … the balance of ri sks, including risks to the financial system that coul d impede the attainment of the C ommittee ’s goals.”   So the test would be, you know, does a majority of the C ommittee feel that , that  monetary policy is , is triggering that?"
" We try to use our other tools on them, but we , we do keep them in mind as we think about monetary policy."
 You’ve now altered the projections to—the statement to aim for inflation above 2 percent .
" And, you know, you don’t —you also don ’t see people , by and large , lifting off or raising interest rates above zero."
" It says that we expect that the current setting of , of our r ates will be—what we  expect  [is] that it will be appropriate until such time as we reach 2  percent  inflation , that we feel that labor market conditions are consistent with our assessment of maximum employment, and that we ’re on track to achieve inflation moderate —inflation moderately above."
" But why wouldn’t —if the C ommittee was confident that it could reach its new goal of aiming for inflation above 2 percent , why wouldn’ t one of those years at least show inflation being above 2 percent  on the median forecast?"
" Because it —we think, looking at everything we know about inflation dynamics in the United States and around the world over recent decades, we expect it will take some time."
" The economy will be below September 16, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 11 of 32  maximum employment, below full demand."
 And that will tend to wear —to put downward pressure on inflation.
" So we think that once we get up closer to maximum employment, we think that inflation will come back , generally."
  Inflation does move up over time.
" Effectively, what it says is that we’ll, we will  keep policy where it is now —keep the rate policy where it is now until unemployment reaches the Committee ’s assessments or levels that are—sorry, not unemployment , labor market conditions reach levels that are consistent with the Committee ’s assessments of maximum employment , until inflation reaches 2  percent , and until it ’s on track to go above 2 percent  moderately for some time."
" So to follow  up on Mike ’s question there , since you described this guidance as durable, you—you’ve  set up a three -part test here for rate h ikes:  levels consistent with assessments of maximum employment, inflation has risen to 2  percent,  and you’ re on track to moderately exceed 2 percent  for some time."
 How do we pin down assessments of maximum employment?
"  When you say that “ inflation has risen to 2  percent ,” does that mean 2  percent  for a day, a month, six months?"
" So, as you know, maximum employment is not —is not  something that can be reduced to a number the way inflation can."
" So it’s broader labor conditions , consistent with our Committee’s assessment of maximum September 16, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 14 of 32  employment."
" So that would certainly mean low unemployment , it would mean high labor force participation , it would mean wages —it would be a whole range of things ."
" In terms of inflation, you know, this is a C ommittee that is both confident and committed to—and determined to reach our goals."
 We would not be looking for one month of 2 percent  inflation ; we said return to 2—to achieve 2 percent  inflation.
 We want to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent  over time.
" And if we do that, inflation expectations will be right at 2 percent, and that ’ll help us achieve 2  percent  inflation over time and avoid the situation where the central bank loses its ability to support the economy."
 Or do you expect weaker  growth or a —or a  larger contraction rather this year if no fiscal support is forthcoming?
" So , so far the economy has proven resilient to the —to the  lapsing of the —to the, of the  CARES Act unemployment —enhanced unemployment benefits."
" But there ’s, there’s  certainly a risk , though, that , that  those who are unemployed have saved—appear to have saved some of those benefits, a nd they ’ll, they’ll  now spend them , and that , as the months pass, if , if there ’s no follow -up on that, if there isn’t additional support and there isn ’t a job for the —some of those people who are, are  from September 16, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 16 of 32  industries where , where  it’s going to be very hard to find new work, then you’ll —that will start to show up in economic activity."
" And  in that —in a broad sense, all of it goes into thinking about monetary policy."
" We, we have interest rates and bank supervision and financial stability policy and things like that , but we can’t —we can’t  get at those things through our tools."
" And in, in—when we think about maximum employment in particular, we do look at individual groups."
" So high unemployment in a particular racial group like African Americans  when —you know, we would look at that as we think about whether we ’re really at maximum employment."
" We also , though, think that these asset purchases, which total $120 billion a month—you know, which is much larger than, for example , the last asset purchase program during the G lobal F inancial Crisis and the recovery therefrom —we think that that ’s also providing accommodative financial conditions and supporting growth."
" And we’re learning to , to engage in economic activity."
"  And that involves, as I mentioned, you know —I think the more social distancing we can preserve as we go back into the workforce —wearing masks, keeping our distance, that kind of thing—the better we’ ll be able to get economic activity September 16, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 19 of 32  back up close to whe re it was."
" Is that sector large enough to say keep unemployment above —you know, far above your maximum goals?"
" And even after , if we do lift off, we will keep pol icy accommodative until we actually have a moderate overshoot of inflation for some time."
" In other words, since interest rates are your main tool, the things you can do would push down on interest rates."
" Well, if I could follow up, in terms of t he balance sheet, are you concerned that your actions are more likely to produce asset price inflation than goods -andservices inflation?"
" And , by the way, the kinds of tools that we would use to address those sorts of things are not really monetary policy."
" As you know, in August there were about 30 million persons claiming unemployment benefits."
" The overall picture is clear, and that is that the labor market has been recovering, but that it ’s a long way—a long way from maximum employment."
" The number of claims, the quantity of claims , and, frankly,  the fact that PUA claims are new —the P andemic U nemployment A ssistance claims—that ’s a new system that had to be set up."
" So that just tells you, the labor market has improved, but it ’s a long, long way from maximum employment , and it will be some time getting back there."
" I’ll give you another example with— you know, we say unemployment ’s 8.4 percent."
" If you add those back, the level of unemployment ’s pro bably 3 percent  higher."
" On the other hand, by that metric, the , the September 16, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 27 of 32  unemployment rate would have  been in the —in the  20s in , in April."
" You know, I, I can’t be precise about a particular number, but let me just say, there was a lot to like about 3 ½ percent  unemployment."
" No one would say that number is the touchstone or that is, you know, maximum employment."
" A 3½ percent  unemployment rate showed, you know, gains being shared very widely across the i ncome spectrum —in fact, going more to people at the bottom end of the spectrum."
" It showed labor force participation coming up  as—up above many estimates of its trend , as people who ’d been out of the labor force were being pulled into a tight job market."
" There ’s a lot to like about a tough—a tight job market, particularly in a world where we didn ’t see inflation."
" Now, of course we would—we need inflation to perform in line with , with  our framework."
" But the good news is , we think we can have quite low unemployment without raising troubling inflation."
"We are assigned “ maximum employment.”   Now, what does that mean?"
" As I mentioned earlier, it doesn ’t mean a particular headline unemployment number."
 What it means is maximum employment.
" So , you know, we look at —look at  that in many, many different variables, and we ask ourselves whether those variables are—those labor market conditions are consistent with our assessments of what would constitute max imum employment."
" So, so I would just say, the right —in our discussions the last couple of days, the whole Committee, everybody on the Commi ttee is very supportive of the Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy and what ’s in there —very, very broad support , unanimous support for that."
" Ever yone sees the, the  changes in the underlying economy and sees , in their own way, the need to address those —and including the changes we made to the employment mandate and to inflation so that we’re now  at flexible average inflation targeting."
 It is—it ties in very nicely with the Statement of [on ] Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy S trategy.
  So it seems like a lot of the new inflation framework is about shaping inflation expectations.
  But the average American who might be watching this m ight be confused as to why the F ed is overshooting inflation.
"  It is intuitive that, that  high inflation is a bad thing."
  It’s less intuitive that inflation can be too low.
" And the way I would explain it is , is that inflation that’ s too low will mean that interest rates are lower."
" There ’s an expectation of future i nflation that’ s built into every interest rate, right?"
" And to the extent inflation gets lower and lower and lower, interest rates get  lower and lower."
"September 16, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 32 of 32  So we want inflation to be —we want it to be 2  percent , and we want it to average  2 percent ."
" So if inflation averages 2  percent , the public will expect that , and that ’ll be what ’s built into interest rates."
 So we ’re not looking to have high inflation.
 We just want inflation to average 2  percent .
" And that means that , you know, in a downturn, these days , what happens is , inflation, as has happened now —it moves down well below 2 percent ."
" And that means that we ’ve said for , for—we would like to see and we will conduct policies so that inflation moves , for some time , moderately above 2  percent ."
" So it won’t be—these won ’t be large overshoots , and they won’ t be permanent  but to help anchor inflation expectations at 2 percent ."
" And , you know, those are the people we’re  serving , and, you know, we serve them best if we can actually achieve average 2  percent  inflation , we believe."
