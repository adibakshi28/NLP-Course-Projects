 My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.
" We understand the hardship that high inflation is causing, and we remain strongly committed to bringing inflation b ack down to our 2 percent goal ."
" Since early last year, the FOMC has significantly tightened the stance of monetary policy."
 We ’ve raised our policy interest rate by 5¼ percentage points and have continued to reduce our securities holdings at a brisk pac e.
" Today, we decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to reduce our securities holdings."
 I will have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments.
" Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a solid pace, and, so far this year, growth in real GDP has come in above expectations."
 Higher interest rates also appear to be weighing on business fixed investment.
" In our Summary of Economic Projections , or SEP, Committee participants revised up their assessments September 20, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  Page 2 of 28  of real GDP growth, with the median for this year now at 2.1  percent."
" Participants expect growth to cool, with the median projection falling to 1.5 percent next year."
"The labor market remains tight, but supply and demand conditions continue to come into better balance."
 The unemployment rate ticked up in August but remains low at 3.8 percent.
" Nominal wage growth has shown some signs of easing, and job vacancies have declined so far this year."
" Although the jobsto-workers gap has narrowed, labor demand still exceeds the supply of available workers."
" FOMC participants expect the rebalancing in the labor market to continue, easing upward pressures on inflation."
 The median unemployment rate projection in the SEP rises from 3.8 percent at the end of this year to 4.1 percent over the next two years.
Inflation remains well above our longerrun goal of 2 percent.
" Inflation has moderated somewhat since the middle of last year, and longerterm inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets."
" Nevertheless, the progress—process of getting inflation sustainably down to 2 percent has a long way to go."
" The median projection in the SEP for total PCE inflation is 3.3 percent this year, falls to 2.5 percent next year, and reaches 2 percent in 2026."
The Fed ’s monetary policy actions are g uided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.
" My colleagues and I are acutely aware September 20, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 3 of 28   that high inflation imposes significant hardship , as it erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet th e higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation."
" We are highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we ’re strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective."
" We see the current stance of monetary policy as restrictive, putting downward pressure on economic activity, hiring, and inflation."
 We are committed to achieving and sustaining a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to our 2 percent goal over time.
" These projections , of course, are not a Committee decision or plan; if the economy does not evolve as projected, the path of  policy will ad just as appropriate to foster our maximumemployment and price -stability goals."
" We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting, based on the totality of the September 20, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 4 of 28   incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflatio n, as well as the balance of risks."
" Real interest rates now are well above mainstream estimates of the neutral policy rate, but we are mindful of the inherent uncertainties in precisely gauging the stance of policy."
" We ’re prepared to raise rates further if appropriate, and we intend to hold policy at a restrictive level until we ’re confident that inflation is moving down sustainably toward our objective."
" In determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time, the Committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary  policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments."
 We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keeping longer -term inflation expectations well anchored.
 Reducing inflation is likely to require a period of below -trend growth and some softening of labor market conditions .
 Restoring price stability  is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run.
 We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum -employment and price -stability goals.
"  What makes the Committee inclined to think that the fed funds rate at this level is not yet sufficiently restrictive, September 20, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  Page 5 of 28  especially when officials are forecasting a slightly more benign inflation outlook for this year?"
 And we say we ’re committed to achieving and sustaining a stance of monetary policy that ’s sufficiently restrictive to bring down inflation to 2 percent  over time —we said that.
 But the fact that we decided to maintain the policy rate at this meeting doesn ’t mean that we ’ve decided that we have or have not at this time reached that —that  stance of monetary policy that we’re seeking.
 And just on the 2024 projections —what ’s behind that shallower path for interest rate cuts and the need for real rates to be 50 basis points higher?
" So I would say it this way:   First of all, interest rates —real interest rates are , are positive now."
" But what it reflects, though, is that economic activity’ s been stronger than we expected —stronger than I think everyone expected."
" And, and so what you’ re—what you’re  seeing is , this is what people believe, as of now, will be appropriate to achieve what we ’re looking to achieve, which is progress toward our —toward our  inflation goal, as you see in the SEP."
" We want to see that , that this, this —these good inflation readings that we ’ve been seeing for the last three months —we want to see that it ’s more than just three months, right?"
" And , in your view, what would— I know nothing has been decided yet —but what would one more hi ke at the end of the year do to the economy or to inflation?"
" Nonetheless, you know, we need —we need  to get to a place where  we’re confident that we have a stance that will bring inflation down to 2 percent  over time."
 What is it saying about the C ommittee ’s view of the inflation dynamic in the economy that you achieve the same forecast inflation rate for next year but need another half a point of the funds rate on it?
" Does it tell you that —does it tell us that the Committee believes inflation to be more persistent—requires more medicine , effectively?"
"  So I , I guess I would point more to—rather than pointing to a sense of inflation having become more persistent , I wouldn’t think —that’s not —we’ve, we ’ve seen September 20, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 9 of 28   inflation be more persistent over the course of the past year, but I wouldn ’t say that ’s something that’s appeared in the recent data."
" It’ s more about stronger economic activity, I would say."
 So you’ ve said several times that the economy needed a period of below -trend growth to get inflation consistently back to 2 percent.
" So the fact that you ’re getting so much done at so much less cost , does that represent a change in how you think inflation works, a change in how September 20, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 10 of 28   you think the economy works, a change in the mix of supply healing versus demand destruction that’s necessary to achieve this?"
" It is a —it is a  good thing that we, we ’ve seen now meaningful rebalancing in the labor market without an increase in unemployment, and that ’s, that’s  because we’ re seeing that rebalancing in other places —in, for example, job openings and in the jobs –worker gap."
" Also, remember, the natural rate , we think, is, is coming down, which is a supplyside thing, so that the , the gap between any given unemployment rate that ’s lower than that and the natural rate comes down ."
" You ’re right —in, in the median forecast, we don’t see a big increase in unemployment."
" There , there  may come a time when unemployment goes up more  than that, but that ’s, that’s  really what we’ve been seeing is, progress without higher unemployment for now."
" We’re, w e’re seeing, you know, through a combination of the , you know, the  unwinding of the pandemic -related demand and supply distortions and monetary polic y’s work in suppressing September 20, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 12 of 28   demand or , or, you know, alleviating very high demand—t he combination of those two things is actually working."
" You ’re seeing, you know, inflation coming down."
" But it looks like  there was— because there was an acrossthe-board drop in the core PCE projection—core PCE inflation projection for this year, and even then it seems possible that core PCE inflation could come in even lower than the median at 3.7 percent ."
 Would you see a case to raise rates still if it turned out that you were going to achieve the same real rate this year because the decline in inflation proceeds somewhat better than you —than you currently anticipate?
" The decision that we make  at, you know, at each meeting and, certainly , at the —at the  last two meetings this year —it’s going to depend on the totality of all the data:  so, the inflation data, the labor market data, the growth data, the , the balance of risks, and the other events that are happening out there."
" Following up on Nick’ s question, actually —John Will iams, the New York F ed president, obviously, has said things to the effect of , “Next year , as we see inflation kind of ”—again, to Nick’ s point —“as, as we see inflation coming down, we ’re going to need to reduce interest rates to make sure that we ’re not squeezing the economy harder and harder over time.”   And I wonder if that ’s basically the logic that you apply—you know, i s that how you think about it?"
" Yeah, so we’re —as we go into next year, th at’s the question we’ll be asking is —you know, taking into account lags and, and everything else we know about the economy and everything we know about monetary policy, the , the time will come at some point, and I ’m not saying when, that it ’s—that it’s  appropriate to cut."
" I wonder —how do you think about the question of whether the strong GDP growth we ’ve been seeing is driven by excess demand versus supplyside factors, productivity, labor force growth?"
" And , relatedly, if GDP keeps coming in “hot,”  even in the absence of inflation resurgence, would that on its own be a reason to consider more  tightening?"
" Does GDP stay s “hot,” but without inflation ?"
 Maximum employment and price stability are the mandates.
" The question will be, is , is the level —is GDP —is the —is the heat that we see in GDP —is it really a threat to our ability to get back to 2 percent  inflation?"
" The e conomic effects —it could affect —you’ve looked— we’ve looked back at history— it could affect economic output, hiring, and inflation."
 A sustained period of higher —of higher  energy prices can affect consumer expectations about inflation.
 We tend to look through short -term volatility and look at —look at  core inflation.
 This economy’ s seeing added supply in a way that could create longterm inflation stability.
" And since inflation ’s coming down with strong GDP growth, we may have higher productivity."
 All are which —good for the Fed’ s longer -run target of low inflation.
" September 20, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 17 of 28   The, the real point, though, is —the , the worst thing we can do is to fail to restore price stability , because the record is clear on that :  If you , you don’ t restore price stability, inflation comes back, and you go through—you  can have a long period where the economy’ s just very uncertain , and it will affect growth ; it will affect all kinds of things."
  It can be a miserable period to have inflation constantly coming back and the Fed coming in and having to tighten again and again.
" So we fully appreciate  that—you know, the benefits of being able to continue what  we see already, which is rebalancing in the labor market and inflation coming down without seeing, you know, an important , large increase in unemployment, which has been typical of other tightening cycles."
" When you look at the disinflation that has taken place so far, do you see it mostly as a result of what some economists are calling “ the low -hanging fruit ”—such as the unwinding of supply chain snarls and other pandemic disruptions —or is it more a broad disinflationary trend that involves most goods and services across the economy?"
" So if I—i f I understood your question, it’s—I would say it this way :  I thin k we knew from the time —from before when we lifted off, but certainly by the time we lift—we knew that bringing inflation back down was going to take, as I call it, the unwinding of these distortions to both supply and demand that happened because of the pandemic and the response."
" In addition, monetary policy was going to help."
" It was going to help supply side heal by, by  cooling demand off and, just in general, September 20, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 18 of 28   better aligning supply with demand."
" In June, you forecast a 5.6 percent  year -end median fed funds rate, and since then , you’ve more than doubled your growth forecast."
 You lowered your unemployment forecast significantly.
"  So, what would justify that last move, because the median forecast is for lower inflation?"
" But to get to, to your question, though—what ’s happened is , growth has come in stronger, right ?"
" Unemployment, you know —you also see that the , the ultimate unemployment rate is not as high, but that —that ’s really because of what we’ ve been seeing in the lab or market."
 We ’ve seen more and more progress in the labor market without seeing significantly higher unemployment.
" In terms of inflation, you, you are seeing— the last three readings are , are very good readings."
"  But if you look at June, July, and August, you’ re looking at, you know, really significant declines in core inflation, largely in the goods sector —also to  some extent in housing services and just a little in nonhousing services."
" Headline inflation, of course, has come way September 20, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 19 of 28   down, largely due to lower energy prices, some of which is now reversing."
"  Given the —given the  forecast that you  have, what justified not moving today, and what could justify moving in the future if you think inflation is coming down?"
" And , and I think as we get closer to the rate that we think —the stance of monetary policy that we think is appropriate to bring inflation dow n to 2  percent  over time, you know, the risks become more two  sided , and the risk of overtightening and the risk of , of undertightening becomes more equal."
" So we’re, we ’re taking advantage of the fact that we have moved quickly to move a little more carefully now as we—as we sort of find our way to, to the right level of restriction that we need to get inflation back down to 2 percent ."
" I mean, if you ’re looking —if—we, we can tell how much inflation has gone up in a given month, right?"
" September 20, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 21 of 28   But I think , in this situation —where it looks like we ’ve had a bit of a turn in inflation starting in June—we ’re also looking at six months , and even three months, but really six months ’ inflation."
" So how does that factor into your decision to raise rates or not —because i n the last two inflation reports, PCE and CPI, we ’ve seen, the overall inflation has actually risen ?"
" The reason why we look at core inflation, which excludes food and energy, is that energy goes up and down like that."
" And it doesn’t—energy, energy prices mostly, mostly don’ t contain much of a signal about how tight the economy is, and hence don ’t tell you much about where inflation’ s really going."
" How long do you September 20, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 22 of 28   think the consumer can manage that debt at higher interest rates now?"
" I think it ’s always hard to say precisely, but it’s —most , most  people do a common decomposition of the increase, and the y’ll, they’ll—the  view will be , it’s not —it’ s not mostly about inflation expectations."
" So —but , essentially, they ’re, they’re  moving up because— it’s not because of inflation."
" It’ s because probably —it’ll  probably have September 20, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 23 of 28   something to do with s tronger growth, I would say—more , more  supply of Treasuries."
" You ’ve said slower shelter cost growth is in the pipeline and will reflect in inflation readings as new leases are signed, but there’ s also some questions out there about the way housing costs are measured, particularly the use of rental equivalents, which are estimates from homeowners about what their homes would rent for if they were in the rental market."
" So my question is , how much of the effort to tame inflation, both as it ’s measured and felt by the broader public, hinges on housing supply?"
" And then as far as a constrained housing supply being sort of exacerbated by this sort of lockin effect of mortgages being higher now than they were at their recent historic lows, how is that going to impact future thinking about taking interest rates to that lower bound in the future?"
" But in terms of, of  where inflation ’s going in the near term, though, as , as you obviously know, a lot of it is , is leases that are running off and then being re -signed or re -leased at a level that ’s, that’s  not as —it won ’t be that much higher."
" So as those leases are rolling over, we’ re, we’re  seeing what we expect, which is measured housing services inflation coming down."
 Would that help you get inflation closer to your 2  percent  target?
" The , the only concern—it , it just means this :  If the economy comes in stronger than expected, that just means we ’ll have to do more in terms of monetary policy to get back to 2 percent —because we will get back to 2  percent ."
"  So, what —I guess it ’s fair— it’s fair to say that the economy has been stronger than many expected, given, given what ’s been happening with, with  interest rates."
 We were making progress on inflation.
 Growth is strong.
" But I think by many forecasts —many, many, many forecasts call for growth to, to mode rate over the course of the next year."
 And so the point I would make there is that we ’re trying to get inflation back down.
 The people who are most hurt by inflation are the people who are on a fixed income.
" We’ d like the current trend to continue, which is that we ’re making progress without seeing the kind of increase in unemployment that we ’ve seen past —in past things."
" In terms of how low and moderate  Americans —you know, they’re  clearly —were suffering from, from high inflation."
" I think now it ’s a very “ hot” labor market, and you’re seeing high [growth in] nominal wages, and you’ re starting to see [ that growth rates of] real wages are now positive by most —by most  measures."
" So surveys are showing dissatisfaction, and I think a lot of that is just, people hate inflation —hate it."
" The biggest wage increases having gone to relatively low -wage jobs —and now [with] inflation coming down—you’ re seeing [increases in] real wages, which  is a good thing."
