  This accommodative policy should support further progress toward our statutory objectives of maximum employment and price stability.
" However, recent economic indicators have been mixed, suggesting that our cautious approach to adjusting monetary policy remains appropriate."
Economic growth was relatively weak late last year and early this year.
  Some of the factors weighing on growth were expected .
" For example, exports have been soft, reflecting subdued foreign demand and the earlier appreciation of the dollar."
" In addition, growth in household spending slowed noticeably early in the year despite solid increases in household income as well as relatively high levels of consumer sentiment and wealth."
 This recovery is a key factor supporting the Committee ’s expectation that overall economic activity will expand at a moderate pace over the next few years.
"  June 15, 2016  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 2 of 21   Despite lackl uster economic growth, the job market continued to improve early in the year."
  And the unemployment rate held near 5 percent even though notabl y more people were actively looking for work.
 A broader measure of unemployment that includes individuals who want and are available to work but have not searched recently  as well as people who are working part time but would rather work full time has flattened out.
" On a more positive note, average hourly earnings increased 2 ½ percent over the past 12 months —a bit faster than in earlier years and a welcome indication that wage growth may finally be picking up."
"  That said, we will be watching the job market carefully."
 Ongoing economic growth and an improving labor market underpin our inflation outlook.
" Overall consumer price inflation —as measured by the price index for personal consumpt ion expenditures —was about 1 percent over the 12 months ending in April, still short of our 2 percent objective."
" Core inflation, which excludes energy and food prices, has been running close to 1½ percent."
"  As the transitory influences holding down inflation fade, and as the labor market strengthens further, the Committee expects inflation to rise to 2 percent over the next two to thr ee years."
"  June 15, 2016  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 3 of 21   Our inflation outlook also rests importantly on our judgment that longer -run inflation expectations remain reasonably well anchored."
"  However, we can ’t take the stability of longer -run inflation expectations for granted."
" While most survey measur es of longer -run inflation expectations show little change, on balance, in recent months, financial market  measures of inflation compensation have declined."
 Movements in these indicators reflect many factors and therefore may not provide an accurate readi ng on changes in the inflation expectations that are most relevant for wages and prices.
"  Nonetheless, in considering future policy decisions, we will continue to carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward our inflation goal."
"  As always, each participant ’s projections are conditioned on his or her own view of appropriate monetary policy , which, in turn, depends on each person’ s assessment of th e multitude of factors that shape the outlook."
 Participants ’ projections for growth of inflationadjusted gross domestic product are slightly lower in the near term than the projections made for the March FOMC meeting.
"  The median growth projection now re mains at 2 percent through 2018, in line with its estimated longer -run rate."
"  The median projection for the unemployment rate edges down from 4.7  percent at the end of this year to 4.6 percent in the next two years, somewhat below the median assessment of the longer -run normal unemployment rate."
 The median path of the unemployment rate is little changed from March.
" Finally, the median inflation projection stands at 1.4 percent this year, a bit firmer than in March, and then rises to 1.9 percent next year and 2 percent in  2018."
" Returning to monetary policy, as I said, the Committee maintained its target range for the federal funds rate."
"  This decision reflects the Committee ’s careful approach in setting monetary policy, particularly in light of the mixed re adings on the labor market and economic growth that I  June 15, 2016  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 4 of 21   have discussed as well as continuing below -target inflation."
"  Proceeding cautiously in raising our interest rate target will allow us to verify that economic growth will return to a moderate pace, that the labor market will strengthen further, and that inflation will continue to make progress toward our 2 percent objective."
" Caution is all the more appropriate given that short -term interest rates are still near zero, which means that monetary policy can more effectively respond to surprisingly strong inflation pressures in the future than to a weakening labor market and falling  inflation."
" In the current environment of sluggish global growth, low inflation, and already very accommodative monetary policy in many advanced economies, investor perceptions of, and appetite for, risk can change abruptly."
"  We expect the rate to remain, for some tim e, below levels that are anticipated to prevail in the longer run because headwinds weighing on the economy mean that the interest rate needed to keep the economy operating near its potential is low by historical standards."
" These headwinds —which include developments abroad, subdued household formation, and meager productivity growth—could persist for some time."
"  But, if they gradually fade over the next few years as we expect, then the interest rate required to keep the economy operating at an even keel should move higher as well."
This view is consistent with participants ’ projections of appropriate monetary policy.
"  These forecasts represent participants ’ individual assessments of appropriate policy given their projections of economic growth, employment, inflation, and other factors."
"  How much of a factor was that in today ’s decision , relative to the questions you ’ve  June 15, 2016  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 6 of 21   elucidated about, the  domest ic jobs numbers and inflation data ?"
" And I think what we can see, and what many econometric and other studies  show , is that the so -called neutral  June 15, 2016  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 7 of 21   rate—namely , the level of  the federal funds rate that is consistent with the economy growing roughly a t trend a nd operating near full employment—t hat rat e is quite depressed by historical standards."
" Many estimates would put it, in real or inflation -adjusted terms , near zero."
" But there are also more long -lasting or persistent factors that may be at work that are holding down the longer -run level of n eutral rates —for example, slow  productivi ty growth, which is not just a  U.S. phenomenon but a global phenomenon."
" You know, obviously, there is a lot of uncertainty about what will  happen to productivity growth, but  productivity growth could stay long for  a prolonged time , and we have an aging—aging societies  in many parts of the world that could depress this neutral rate.1  And I think all of us are involved in a process of constantly reevaluating where is that neutral rate going , and I think what you see is a downward shift in that assessment over  time , the sense that maybe more of what ’s causing  this neutral rate to be low are factors that are not g oing to be rapidly disappearing  but will be part of the new normal."
" Now,                                                  1 Chair Yellen intended to say, “ You know, obviously, there is a lot of uncertainty about what will happen to productivity growth, but productivity growth could stay low for a prolonged time, and we have an aging —aging societies in many parts of the world that could depress this neutral rate."
 And we ’re also looking at the prospects for economic growth and continued progress in the labor market.
" The forecast t hat you see in the SEP and the statement indicate the  Committee continues to expect w e will have moderate  June 15, 2016  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 9 of 21   growth, 2 percent growth —so , you know, suggest s healthy growth for the rest of the year and a pickup i n growth in the second quarter , and we expect to  see continuing progress in the labor  market."
" Now, we had ques tions about the growth outlook because we did see slower growth in the fourth quarter and in the first quarter."
 And we will be watching the  spending data to make sure growth is picking up in line with our expectations .
"Of cour se, with respect to inflation , we’re constantly evaluating whether or not incoming information is roughly in line with our expectations."
" It may turn out —you know, again, we should never pay  too much attention to, for example, one job market report."
" And the second factor is the socalled term premium , or th e extra yield that investors demand in order to hold a longer -term security instead of to invest short term."
" And clearly, market expectations for the path of short -term interest rates over the next 10 years remain low , and that is a factor."
" As I said, we have good reason to believe that the socalled neutral rate or rate compatible with the economy operating at full employment is low at  the present time."
" In your speech in Philadelphia, you called the slowdown in job growth last month “ concerning ,” and you mentioned today that you want to verify that the underlying momentum in  the economy and in the labor market is still continuing."
" What do you need to see  to convince you that the labor market is  still movi ng toward full employment , and  for how long would you need to see it?"
" Clearly, we will be looking at the next job report , and if we were to s ee a healthy pace of job growth, you know, above that needed to kind of  June 15, 2016  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 13 of 21   maintain the status quo i n the labor market."
" So, you know, I should say, over  time, we should expect to see, as the economy comes closer to maximum employment, the likely pace of job gains is probably going to slow  down somewhat."
" There might be revisions to previous months that would change our views , but there will be other surveys of employment intentions and other indicators of the labor market that w e’ll focus —we’ll be focusing on."
 You mentioned in your remarks at the beginning that we are getting a slightly different signal when you look at inflation versus when you look at inflation expectations.
 Are you more concerned with the inflation expectations or focusing more on the slight pickup in actual  inflation?
" You know, I would say, with respect to the behavior of inflation, inflation is behaving roughly in the manner I would have expected;  I have really not seen significant surprises there."
" W e’ve long said th at an important reason that inflation is as low as it’ s been is b ecause of past declines in  energy prices a nd increases in the value of the dollar , and as those factors began to dissipate, we would see inflation moving up."
"  June 15, 2016  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 15 of 21   And with respect to c ore inflation, which—now , that ’s partly influenced also by the dollar , but t rying to pull out the dollar and  import price influence —core inflation seems to be behaving roughly as one would expect with well -anchored inflation expectations and in improving labor markets."
" So I ’m not seeing anything —inflation , even core inflation, is running under 2 percent ."
" But, we ’ve seen in the past , and economic theory suggests , that inflation expectations are relevant to price and wage setting decisions."
 So we do monitor indicators of inflation expectations carefully.
" Now, it ’s very hard to know exactly what inflation expectations are relevant to actual price and wage decisions."
" And so, for example, we have seen the Michigan survey, a measure of household inflation expectations , move down."
 And measures of inflation compensation— I always try to be careful to call it “inflation compensation”  rather than “inflation expectations ” because they ’re not inflation expectations.
" Inflation expectations influence those market measures, but there ’s also an inflation risk premium."
 And there are actually good reasons to think that the  inflation risk premium could have decline d significantly and may  be depressing those measures.
" So we watch them, we’ ve taken note in the statement that they ’ve moved down , but actual inflation is behaving more or less as would be expe cted."
" But I think if you look at the statement, we pointed to slower growth but pointed out that the fundamentals —there was no obvious fundamental reason for growth to have slowed."
" The F ed has repeatedly voiced its concern over the slow pace of wa ge growth, a nd I was wondering, do you think that increasing the federal minimum wage could be of any help ?"
 Could it boost the higher wages and eventually drive up the inflation?
 So I think that the minimum wage incre ases that have gone into effect —estimates that I ’ve seen suggest it’s a relatively minor influence on the aggregate level of wage inflation.
 I would take somewhat faster wage increases  to be a sign  that labor market slack is diminishing and that the labor market is approaching conditions that are consistent with maximum employment.
" So, I think, you know, I think we have seen some hints, perhaps preliminary indications , that wage growth  is picking up."
" And as much as anything, I think it ’s a sign of a  generally healthy labor market, which is what our  mandated objective is, to achieve maximum employment."
" There’ s been a lot of discussion in last couple months about the slow pace of demand in the global economy, a nd some economists think that central banks should think about using helicopter money, maybe in Japan first or Europe first."
" We have seen all too many examples of countries that end up with high or even hyperinflation because those in charge of fiscal policy direct their central bank to help the m finance it by printing money, a nd maintaining price stability and low and stable inflation is very much aided by having central bank independence."
" Now, that said, in unusual times wher e the concern is with very weak growth or possibly deflation —rather rare circumstances —first of all, fiscal policy can be a very important tool."
" Well, it is c onceivable in a scenario when—where growth and inflation really surprise us to the upside that we would have  to raise short -term interest rates so rapidly that the rates we would be paying on reserves would exceed what we ’re earning on our portfolio."
 So this does requires an extreme scenario wit h very rapid increases in short -term interest rates.
" This is pr obably an economy that ev erybody would feel very pleased—was performing  well and better than expected, and where monetary policy —you know, our goal is  June 15, 2016  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 19 of 21   price stability and maximum employment, and we would probably feel that we had done very well in achievin g that."
" So, we usually make money —we’ve been making a lot of money in recent years , but the goal of monetary policy is not to maximize our income."
" To what extent do you feel constrained in raising interest rates by the low  or even negative rates that foreign  central banks are pursuing , possibly out of concern for what it might mean for the dollar exchange rate?"
" So the  state of foreign economies, both their growth outlooks and the stance of monetary policy, t hose are factors that influence the U .S."
outlook and influence  the appropriate stance of monetary policy.
" So, of course, we do look at forei gn rates, the prospects —and the prospects for growth in those economies in considering the stance of policy."
" Differentials between countries in  likely policy paths do tend to spill  over into exchange rates —that is a standard part of how monetary policy wor ks—and a stronger dolla r, those have a both—a depressing effect."
 It creates channels through which domestic demand is depressed.
"growth, s o that ’s a factor that we take into account."
 And increases in the dollar that we ’ve seen since mid -2014 have served to push inflation down as well ; it can also have impacts on commodity prices that are relevant.
" When we have an outlook for continuing above -trend  growth —that if we held rates absolutely flat, we have reason to bel ieve inflat ion would overshoot our target —we would see a case to gradually raise rates over time."
" But, for example, if we were to see upside surprises to growth and to i nflation and had to raise short -term r ates faster, thought we should, one of the channels by which that would work would be the a ssociated impact on the dollar."
" How much are you  watching oil pr ices and their impact on inflation , and how that could affect the timing of future rate increases and how much you might increase rates?"
" As you said, falling oil prices pull down inflation ."
" You know, it takes falling oil prices to lower inflation on a sustained basis."
" Once they stabilize at whatever level, their impact on inflation dissipates over time."
" N ot only have they stabilized, they have moved up some, and their inflation is —their impact on inflation is w aning over time."
" But in many countries around the world that are important commodity exporters, the decline we ’ve seen in oil prices has had a depressing effect on their growth, their trade w ith us and other trade partners, and caused problems that have had spillovers to the global economy as well."
