 My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.
" Inflation has eased substantially over the past year , while the labor market has remained strong ."
" But inflation is still too high, further progress in bringing it down is not assured, and the path forward is uncertain."
 We are fully committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent goal.
" Today , the FOMC decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to reduce our securities holdings, though at a slower pace."
" Our restrictive stance of monetary policy has been putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation, and the risks  to achieving our employment and inflation goals have moved toward better balance over the past year."
" However, in recent months , inflation has shown a lack of further progress toward our 2 percent objective, and we remain highly attentive to inflation risks."
 I’ ll have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments.
 Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace.
" Although GDP growth moderated from 3.4 percent in the fourth quarter of last year to 1.6 percent in the first quarter, private domestic f inal purchases—which excludes inventory investment, government spending and net exports , and usually sends a clearer signal on underlying demand—was 3.1 percent in the first quarter, as strong as the second half of 2023."
" Consumer spending has been robust over the past several quarte rs, even as high interest rates May 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL Page 2 of 26  have weighed on housing and equipment investment."
 Improving supply conditions have supported resilient demand and the strong performance of the U.S. economy over the past year.
"The labor market remains relatively tight, but supply  and demand conditions have come into better balance."
" Payroll job gains averaged 276,000 jobs per month in the first quarter, while the unemployment rate remains low at 3.8 percent."
" Nominal wage growth has eased over the past year and the jobsto-workers gap has narrowed, but labor demand still exceeds the supply of available workers."
Inflation has eased notably over the past year but remains above our longerrun goal of 2 percent.
  The inflation data received so far this year have been higher than expected.
" Although s ome measures of short -term inflation expectations have increased in recent months, longerterm inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets."
 The Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.
" My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship , as it erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation."
 We are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective.
" Over the past year, as labor market tightness has eased and inflation has declined, the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals have moved toward better balance."
" The economic outlook is uncertain, however, and we remain highly attentive to inflation risks."
 We’ve stated that we do not expect  that it will be appropriate to reduce the target range for the federal funds rate until we have gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent.
" In particular, and as I noted earlier, readings on inflation have come in above expectations."
 We know that reducing policy restraint too soon or too much could result in a reversal of the progress we ’ve seen on inflation.
" At the same time, reducing policy restraint too late or too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment."
 We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keeping longer -term inflation expectations well anchored.
 Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run.
" We , at the Fed, will do everything we can to achieve our maximum -employment and price -stability goals."
" A question and follow -up if I could, do you consider the current policy rate still —are you confident that it ’s sufficiently restrictive to get inflation back to 2 percent?"
" So I do think the evidence shows , you know, pretty clearly that policy is restrictive and is weighing on demand, and there are a few places I would point to for that."
" So demand is still strong—the demand side of the labor market , in particular—but it ’s cooled from its extremely high level of a couple years ago, May 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  Page 5 of 26   and you see that in job openings ."
" That’s, that’s  demand cooling."
" You also see in interest -sensitive spending, like housing and investment —you also see that higher  interest rates are weighing on those activities."
" So as a follow -up, if inflation continues running roughly sideways as it has been, the job market stays reasonably strong, unemployment low, and expectations are anchored and maintained, would you disrupt that for — CHAIR POWELL."
" You know, I think we’d need to see persuasive evidence that our policy stance is not sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation sustainably down to 2 percent over time."
" That would include inflation, inflation expectations, and all the other data too."
 Would that be —would that be  a reacceleration in inflation?
 And we’ve said that we don’ t think it would be appropriate to dial back our restrictive policy stance until we ’ve gained greater confidence  that inflation is moving down sustainably toward 2 percent.
" So, for example, let me take a path :  If we did have a path where inflation proves more persistent than expected and where the labor market remains strong , but inflation is moving sideways and we’ re not gaining greater confidence, well, that would be a case in which it could be appropriate to hold off on rate cuts."
" And those would be —two of those paths would be that we do gain greater confidence, as we ’ve said, that inflation is moving sustainably down to 2 percent , and another path could be , you know, an unexpected weakening in the labor market, for example."
" And could you just follow —on the path where you might not cut, is that —you mentioned that would be inflation persistent —I mean, is inflation —would that be the key data in making that decision, or could you expand a bit more on that?"
" Again, it ’s, it’s—we ’ve set ourselves a test that we —for us to begin to reduce policy restriction, we ’d want to be confident that inflation is moving—you know, moving sustainably down to 2 percent, and, for sure , one of the things we ’d be looking at is the performance of inflation."
 We’d also be looking at inflation expectations .
" But clearly, incoming , incoming inflation data would be at the very heart of that decision."
" Chair Powell, to what extent has the easing in financial conditions since November contributed to the reacceleration in growth, and do you now expect a period of sustained tighter financial conditions will be needed to resume the sort of disinflation the e conomy saw last year?"
" You know, i f you look at—let ’s look at growth."
" R eally , what we ’ve seen so far this year in the first quarter is growth coming in about consistent with where it was last year."
" I know GDP came in lower , but you don’t see an acceleration in growth ."
" I mean , the thought would be that financial conditions loosened in, in, December , and that caused an uptic k in activity , and that caused inflation."
" What you see is economic activity at a level that ’s roughly the same as , as last year."
"  May 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  Page 9 of 26   So, you know, what ’s causing this inflation ?"
" And, you know, that ’s appropriate , given what inflation has done in the first quarter."
 You’ve said in the past that stronger growth wouldn’ t necessarily preclude rate cuts.
"  I wonder , would continued strength in the labor market change your view about the appropriate stance of policy if it was accompanied by signs the wage growth was reaccelerating ?"
 So I just want to be careful that we don ’t target wage growth or the labor market .
" And remember what we saw last year :  very strong growth, a really tight labor market, and a historically fast decline in inflation."
" There’s the unwinding of the pandemic -related supplyside distortions and demand -side distortions, and there ’s also monetary policy, you know, restrictive monetary policy."
" And also , even when the supplyside issues are solved , it should take some time for that to affect economic activity and ultimately inflation."
" So I don’ t like to say that either strong—either growth or , or a strong labor market , in and of itself , would automatically create problems on inflatio n, because , of course , it didn’ t do that last year."
 We target price inflation.
" The point with wages is , of course , we, like everyone else, like to see high wages, but we also want to see them not eaten up by high inflation."
" A nd that ’s really what we ’re trying to do,  is to cool the economy and work with what ’s happening on the supply side to bring—to bring the economy back to 2 percent inflation."
 You talked about needing time to gain more confidence that inflation is sustainably moving back down to 2 percent .
" We see strong economic May 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  Page 11  of 26   activity, we see a strong labor market, and we see inflation."
" We see three inflation readings , and so I think you’ re at a point there where you should take some signal."
  And the signal that we ’re taking is that it ’s likely to take longer for us to gain confidence that we are on a sustainable path down to 2 percent inflation.
  If I could follow  up on that :  What particular areas were sort of temporary or blips in the inflation data in the first quarter?
" What’s happened since December is you’ ve seen higher goods inflation than expected, and you’ ve seen higher nonhousing services inflation than expected."
" And there are stories behind how that happened, and, you know, we—I think —I thin k my expectation is that we will, over the course of this year, see inflation move back down."
" We also continue to expect, and I continue to expect , that housing services inflation, given where market rents are, those will show up in measured housing services inflation over time."
" If I could just follow  up:  Is there a bit of a contradiction in the idea that you are reducing quantitative tightening, which is sort of an easing, while you ’re holding rates steady at a restrictive rate to try to slow and cool the economy and inflation?"
" No.  I mean , the active tool of monetary policy is, of course , the interest rates ."
" And given your history there, I wonder if there ’s an argument for being more patient with inflation here."
 We have strong productivity growth that ’s helping wages grow up—go up.
 W e have good employment .
 And so it seems to me there ’s a lot of hysteria about inflation.
" But all I can say is that , you know, we ’ve said that we didn’ t think it would be appropriate to cut until we were more confident that inflation was moving sustainably down to 2 percent ."
"In terms of the employment mandate, to your point, if you go back a couple of years, our , our sort of framework document says that , when you look at the two mandate goals, and if one of them is further away from goal than the other, then you focus on that one."
 And that was clearly inflation.
 So our focus was very much on inflation.
" As inflation has com e down, now to below 3 percent on a —on a 12month basis, it ’s become —we ’re now focusing [ on] the other goal ."
 The employment goal now comes back into focus.
" Just to go back to the answer before the previous one, it seemed to suggest that you think the likeliest path of inflation is one that ’s going to allow you to have a situation where rates are lower at the end of the year than they are right now."
 And I don’ t have great confidence in which of those paths —I think I would say my personal forecast is that we will begin to see further progress on inflation this year.
" I guess I would say I was around for stagflation, and it was , you know, 10 percent —10 percent unemployment ."
 It was high single -digits inflation .
" Right now we have —and very slow growth—so right now we have 3 percent growth, which is , you know, pretty solid growth I would say, by any measure, and we have inflation running under 3 percent."
"  And, in addition, I would say most forecasters, including our forecasting, was that last year ’s level of growth was very high—3.4 percent in , I guess, the fourth quarter , you know —and probably not going to be sustained and would come down."
 That would still be to a very healthy level of growth.
" And, of course , with inflation, you know, our —we will return inflation to 2 percent, and that won’ t be—so I don’ t see the “stag” or the “flation,”  actually."
" The Vice Chair of the FOMC said recently that he’ s willing to consider the idea that potential growth has May 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  Page 15 of 26   moved up."
" A nd, of course , he’s “Mr. Potential Growth /r*.”  Do you share that view , and would that imply that maybe policy isn ’t tight enough?"
" So I think I would take that question this way:  We saw a year of very high productivity growth in 2023, and we saw a year of , I think , negative productivity growth in 2022."
" I mean , the question is , will productivity run—there are two questions ."
 One is:  Will productivity run persistently above its longer -run trend?
" We’ve had a —what amounts to a , a significant increase in the potential output of the economy that ’s not about productivity ."
 So you’ ve also got demand.
" So  it—there may be —it may be that you get more supply than you get demand at the beginning, but , ultimately , it should be neither inflationary nor disinflationary over, over  a longer period."
"  If growth is higher , but you’ re not considering rate increases, does that imply that you’re more worried about causing the economy to slow too much than you are about inflation taking off again?"
" You see it in inflation -sensitive spending, where demand has clearly come down a lot over the past few years."
" And that ’s, that’s  more from monetary policy, whereas the supply side  of things that are happening are more on the supply side."
 So GDP growth is about 2  percent .
 Inflation —[Un] employment is about 4 percent .
" It feels a lot like a steady state, and we have 3 percent inflation ."
" So if the data remains the same that you ’re seeing, and I know you said you don’ t see a rate hike, but it stands to reason that you would need a rate hike to get from 3 to 2 percent inflation."
" So was there any discussion about a rate hike in today’ s meeting , and, you know, are you satisfied with 3  percent inflation for the rest of the year?"
"  Well, of course we ’re not satisfied with 3  percent inflation."
”  [Laughter]  So  we will return inflation to 2 percent over time but over time.
" So if we were to conclude that policy is not sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation sustainably down to 2 percent, then that would be what it would take for us to want to increase rates."
 Is there a time frame of persistent inflation that would trigger a rate hike?
" You know, c learly restrictive monetary policy needs more time to do its job."
"  One thing that hasn’ t normalized is wage growth, which is still quite a bit stronger than before the pandemic."
" And, again , we don’ t target wage increases, but , you know, in the longer run, if you have —if you have wage increases running higher than productivity would warrant, then, you know, there will be inflationary pressures."
" You mentioned consumers , and consumers are feeling the weight of interest rates right now."
" Well, the thing that hurts everybody , and particularly people in the lower -income brackets, is inflation."
" And so, with those people in mind, in particular, what we’ re doing is , we’re using our tools to bring down inflation."
" And we will bring inflation back down to 2 percent , and t hen people won’ t have to worry about it again."
" I think core—I think headline —core PCE  May 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  Page 20 of 26   [inflation] peaked at 5.8 [percent]."
" Quick follow -up—are current interest rates really doing that much , though,  to fight inflation right now for those consumers?"
" I mean , I think—I think that restrictive monetary policy is doing what it ’s supposed to do, and it’s —but it ’s also , in this case unusually , working alongside and with the healing of the supply side."
" This, this —what was different this time was that a big part of the source of the inflation and the reason why we ’re having this conversation is that we had this supplyside kind of collapse , with shortages and bottlenecks and all that kind of thing."
" And so—and this was to do with the shutt ing down and reopening of the economy and other things that , that  really raised demand."
"  So I think now you see those two things working together, the reversal of those supply and  demand distortions from the pandemic and the response to it, along with restrictive monetary policy ."
" Those two things are working to bring down inflation, and we ’ve made a lot of progress."
" W e’ve got work left to do, but we ’re not looking at the very high inflation rates that we were seeing two years ago."
 I wanted to follow  up on something you mentioned earlier on housing inflation .
 There’s kind of been this longawaited  disinflation in  shelter that still hasn ’t arrived.
"  So I guess two questions, how do you explain the substantial lags between some of the private -sector data we’ re seeing and the government data, and how confident are you that rents will be helpful on the inflation front in the coming months?"
"  So, essentially , there are—there are a number of places in the economy where there are just lag structures built into the inflation process , and housing is one of them."
 The inflation in those has been very low.
" Now I am confident that, as long as market rents remain low, this is going to show up in measured inflation, assuming that market rents do remain low."
" It seems that over the past three or four years , economies and central banks in developed markets , at least , have been on more or less the same trajectory :  easing during the pandemic, fighting inflation with restrictive policy on the way out ."
 So I think the difference between the United States and other countries that are now considering rate cuts is that they’ re just not having the kind of growth we ’re having.
" They have —their inflation is performing about like ours or maybe a little better, but they’ re not experiencing the kind of growth we ’re experiencing."
" So we actually have the luxury of having strong growth and  a strong labor market, very low unemployment, high job creation, and all of that, and we can be patient ."
" A nd that ’s, I think, partly because emerging market countries, many of them have much better monetary policy frameworks, much more credibility on inflation ."
 You sort of backed away from the notion that the economy would need to encounter pain for inflation to come back down.
" But , given the sticky inflation data in the first quarter, can disinflation still happen along a relatively painless path for the economy , or is some softening in the labor market and the economy likely needed to bring inflation back down?"
" I think we thought, and most people thought, there would have to be probably significant dislocations somewhere in the economy, perhaps the labor market, to get inflation all the way down from the very high levels it was at at the beginning of this episod e."
" And, if you look at the dynamics that enabled that, it really was that  this, the—that so much of the gain was from the unwinding of things that weren ’t to do with monetary policy but  the unwinding of the distortions to the economy, you know, supply problems —supplyside problems and also some , some  demand issues as well."
 The unwinding of those really helped inflation come down.
" So I think —I think it is possible that , that  those forces will still work to help us bring inflation down."
" And so we ’re—you know, we’re  trying to use our tools in a way that keeps the labor market strong, and the economy strong, but also helps bring inflation back down to 2 percent sustainably."
 We will bring inflation down to 2 percent sustainably .
"  And speaking of dislocations in the labor market:  In terms of cutting , you said, if there were weakness in the job market , that could be a reason to cut rates."
"  So if the unemployment rate were to tick above 4 percent but inflation not back down to your 2 percent target, how would you look at that?"
  Would the unemployment rate popping back above 4 percent catch your attention?
 A couple of tenths in the unemployment rate would be —would probably not do that .
" You know, and so each , each  Reserve Bank has its own culture around monetary policy and its own approach and that kind of thing."
