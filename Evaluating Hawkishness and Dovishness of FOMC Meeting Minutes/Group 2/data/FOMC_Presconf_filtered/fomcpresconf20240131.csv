 My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.
 Inflation has eased from its highs without a significant increase in unemployment.
" But inflation is still too high, ongoing progress in bringing it down is not assured, and the path forward is uncertain."
 I want to assure the American people that we’ re fully committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent goal.
" Today, the FOMC decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to reduce our securities holdings."
" Over the past two years, we ’ve significantly tightened the stance of monetary policy."
" Our strong actions have moved our policy rate well into restrictive territory, and we ’ve been seeing the effects on economic activity and inflation."
" As labor market tightness has eased and progress on inflation has continued, the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals are moving into better balance."
" I will have more to say about monetary policy —about monetary policy, after briefly reviewing economic developments."
 Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a solid pace.
 GDP growth in the fourth quarter of last year came in at 3.3 percent.
" For 2023 as a whole, GDP expanded at 3.1 percent, bolstered by strong consumer demand as well as im proving supply conditions."
 High interest rates also appear to have been weighing on business fixed investment.
" January 31, 2024   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 2 of 27   The labor market remains tight, but supply and demand conditions continue to come into better balance."
 The unemployment rate remains low at 3.7 percent.
" Nominal wage growth has been easing, and job vacancies have declined."
" Although the jobsto-workers gap has narrowed, labor demand still exceeds the supply of available workers."
 Inflation has eased notably over the past year but remains above our longer -run goal of 2 percent.
 The lower inflation readings over the second half of last year are welcome .
 But we will need to see continuing evidence to build confidence that inflation is moving down sustainably toward our goal.
" Longer -term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets."
 The Fed ’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.
" My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship , as it erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation."
" We’re highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we’re strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective."
" Our restrictive stance of January 31, 2024   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 3 of 27   monetary policy is putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation."
" But the economy has surpris ed forecasters in many ways since the pandemic, and ongoing progress toward our 2 percent inflation objective is not assured."
" The economic outlook is uncertain, and we remain highly attentive to inflation risks."
" As labor market tightness has eased and progress on inflation has continued, the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals are moving into better balance."
 We know that reducing policy restraint too soon or too much could result in a reversal o f the progress we ’ve seen on inflation and ultimately require even tighter policy to get inflation back to 2 percent.
" At the same time, reducing policy restraint too late or too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment."
 The Committee does not expect that it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent.
 We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keeping longer -run— longer -term inflation expectations well anchored.
 Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer  run.
 We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum -employment and price -stability goals.
" Obviously, in the statement and just in your remarks there, you note that you don’ t want to cut interest rates without greater confidence that inflation is coming —coming down fully."
" And as you make those decisions, how are you weighing recent strong growth in consumer spending data against the sort of solid inflation progress you ’ve been seeing?"
" How are —how are  you weighing the growth data and consumption data, which have been surprisingly strong, against inflation data?"
 We ’re—we’re  looking for greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably down to 2 percent.
" It’s—we’re looking at continuation of the good data that we ’ve been seeing, and a good example is inflation."
 So we have six months of good inflation data.
" The question really is, that six months of good inflation data —is it sending us a true signal that we are, in fact, on a path—a sustainable path down to 2 percent inflation?"
"In terms of, of  growth, we ’ve had strong growth."
" I mean, if you take a step back, we ’ve had strong growth—very strong growth [in real GDP] last year —going right into the fourth quarter."
" And yet we ’ve had a very strong labor market, and we ’ve had inflation coming down."
" So I think —whereas a year ago , we, we were thinking that we needed to see some softening in economic activity—that hasn’ t been the case."
" So I think we , we look at —we look at  stronger growth."
" I think, at this point, we want to see strong growth."
" We’re looking for inflation to continue to come down, as it has been coming down for the last six months."
 We have six months of good inflation [readings] .
" But you can—and you know this —you can look behind those numbers, and you can see that a lot of it ’s been coming from goods inflation, for example, and goods inflation running significantly negative."
" It ’s a reasonable assumption that , over time , goods inflation will flatten out —probably approximate zero."
" We need to see more evidence that sort of confirms what we think we ’re seeing and that tells us that we are on —gives us confidence that we ’re on, on a path to—a sustainable path down to 2 percent inflation."
" Two, there were risks of inflation expectations becoming unanchored."
 This morning ’s ECI report for the fourth quarter shows private -sector payroll growth running at a sub–4 percent pace.
 Inflation expectations are very close to where they were before the inflation emergency of the last three years.
" You know, we, w e feel like inflation is coming down."
 Growth has been strong.
 We’re —what we ’re trying to do is identify a place where we ’re really confident about inflation getting back down to 2 percent so that we can then begin the process of dialing back the restrictive level.
" But I think to get to that place where we feel comfortable starting the process, we need some confirmation that inflation is, in fact, coming down sustainably to 2 percent."
" If I could ask differently :  If, if you hold rates high as inflation moderates, as it —as it  has been, target rates will exceed the prescriptions of the Taylor rule or its variants ."
" Another way to think about it is, implicitly, is—so, in theory, of course, real rates go up if —holding all else equal —as inflation comes down."
 But that doesn ’t mean we can mechanically adjust policy as real rates—sorry —as inflation comes down.
" And I think to move, which is —which is where almost everyone on the C ommittee is —is in favor of , of moving rates down this year —but the timing of that is going to be linked to our gaining confidence that inflation is on a sustainable path down to 2 percent."
" I ’d like you to, to  key in on the use of the word in, in the statement that inflation still “ remains elevated."
”  You’ve pledged to cut rates before inflation reached 2 percent.
" So that implies that there ’s some sort of intermediate step here on , on inflation and that a , a cut would be consequent with a change in the statement language that inflation “remains elevated."
" I would just say, if you look at —you know, look at where , where  12month inflation is, and it’s, you know, it ’s still well above —core is 2.9 percent, for example —12month —which is way down from where it was."
" So , if I—if I could follow up on that, the statement allows that you want greater confidence on inflation falling before you cut, but it doesn’ t mention the other side of the mandate —a slide in employment."
" Would a slide in employment also bring you to the point of , of cutting rates?"
 And if we saw inflation being stickier or higher or those sorts of things —would argue for moving later.
" In the base case, though, where , where  the economy is healthy and we have, you know, we have ongoing growth—solid growth —we have a strong labor market —we January 31, 2024   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 9 of 27   have inflation coming down—t hat’s what people are writing their SEP  [submissions] around."
" So, of course, we follow the , the components of inflation very carefully."
 W hich would be :  Goods inflation—I talked about that a little bit ; you mentioned housing inflation.
" So the question is, when will these lower market rents find their way into measured rents , as measured, measured in PCE inflation?"
" But at the same time, we think goods inflation will probably— it’s been giving a lot of disinflation to the effort —and probably that declines over time, but it may well have some , some  January 31, 2024   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 11 of 27   more time to run."
" Inflation is still —you know, core inflation is still well above target on a 12month basis."
 So I ’m wondering what you could tell me —how do you believe the neutral rate is working or telling you right now that growth is stronger?
" And how much restraint does it really need, additionally, if inflation is still coming down?"
" Your , your  second question, though, really, I think, is important, and that is , a lot of this has come through—a lot of the disinflationary process has come through the healing of supply chains and also of the labor market."
" But if you— a standard approach would be to take the nominal rate —5.3 percent, let ’s say —and subtract sort of a , a forward measure of inflation."
" So a lot of the growth we ’re seeing  is not —is—it isn ’t just a tug of war between , between interest rates and demand."
" Do you—do you think the labor market now is back to quote, unquote, “ normal”  and that the —we can achieve the inflation target without wage gains coming back down to what they were pre -pandemic?"
" But we do see —you saw today’ s ECI reading —you know, the evidence is that , that  wage increases are still at a healthy level —very healthy level —but they’ re gradually moving back to levels that would be more associated —given, given assumptions about productivity, are more typically associated with 2 percent inflation."
" Clearly , that the —there was a fairly severe imbalance between demand for workers and supply at the beginning of the pandemic."
" It isn ’t every quarter, but , overall , there ’s a clear trend —still at high levels, but back down to where —what would be consistent with, with  where  we were before the pandemic and with 2 percent inflation."
 It sounded like you suggested that you’ re not worried about faster growth so much—s o wanted to see if you’ re seeing anything that suggests that inflation could reaccelerate from here .
 And it sounds like you ’re saying you’ re not worried that solid growth from here on out poses any risk to inflation.
" No, I think that that is a risk —the risk that inflation would , would reaccelerate."
" Of course, if —if inflation were to surprise by moving back up, that would—we would have to respond to that , and that would—January 31, 2024   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 15 of 27   that would be a surprise at this point."
" Will , will  inflation have dipped and then come back up?"
" And you mentioned below –2 percent inflation for —on a three -month basis, core PCE has been running at 1 ½ percent."
" And there are those on Wall Street who think that if you maintain the level of restriction you have right now, you could end up with inflation running below your target."
  So I guess I would just say this —executive summary would be that growth is solid to strong over the course of last year.
 The labor market —3.7 percent unemployment indicates that the labor market is strong.
" We’ ve had just about two years now of , of unemployment under 4 percent."
 And we ’ve seen inflation come down.
 So  we’ve got six months of good inflation data and an expectati on that there ’s more to come.
  That ’s looking in the re arview —the outlook—we do expect growth to moderate.
 The base of job growth has narrowed.
" And , of course, 12month inflation is, is above target and getting, you know, getting down closer to target."
" Could you get inflation that is below target —end up with inflation below target , and you have to do something about that?"
" So we —the thing is, we ’re not looking for inflation to tap the 2 percent base once."
" And the same thing is true  if we have a month or two of lower —and we have that now —of, of inflation that ’s annualized at a —at a lower level—that wouldn’ t be good."
" We’ re not —you know, we’re not  looking to have inflation anchor below 2 percent."
" I think —I think as of now, you know, the , the question, which—we want to take advantage of this situation and finish the job on inflation while keeping the labor market strong."
" We, we  included that language in the statement to signal clearly that —with strong growth, strong labor market, inflation coming down —the C ommittee intends to move carefully as we consider when to begin to dial back the restrictive stance that we have in place."
" We talked about, there are risks that would cause us to go slower —for example, stronger inflation—more , more  persistent inflation."
" And that would be a weakening in the labor market or , for that matter, very, very persuasive lower inflation."
 Could you talk a little bit more about productivity growth?
" You know, you’ ve mentioned multiple times about, you know, the level of wage growth that’ s consistent with 2 percent inflation."
 Growth has been very strong.
 How much of those numbers do you attribute to productivity?
" And do you see that productivity as sort of just temporary because of the factors—the labor and supply chain factors you were talking about —or do you think that productivity growth will , will fade over time?"
" And I think— my, my own view is —I think if you look, look back to the pandemic, you , you saw a spike in productivity as workers were laid off , and , and activity didn’ t decline as fast."
" And then you saw a deep trough January 31, 2024   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 19 of 27   of productivity."
" And then, over the last —you saw high productivity last year , in ’23."
" And the question will be, what, what is it that has changed the—you know, the productivity tends to be based on, you know, fundamental aspects of our economy."
" It would take —you know, people talk about AI, but I would— my guess is that we may shake out and be back where we were, because I don’t —I’m not sure I see—work from home doesn’ t seem like it ’s a big productivity increase ."
" So I’m not —I’m not seeing why it would, but , you know, right —you know, right now I would say that productivity is kind of what falls out of the , the broader forces that are driving people in and out of the labor force and , and activity returning and supply chains getting fixed."
" So would that be behind why we ’ve seen such strong growth, but we ’ve also seen inflation fall —that maybe there ’s just a higher level of productivity?"
" So when we think about, you know —our , our statutory goals are maximum employment and price stability, and that ’s what we ’re targeting."
" We’ re not targeting housing price inflation, the cost of housing, or any of those things."
" But , you know, where it comes into play very specifically in our work is inflation, which is a combination."
" It ’s, it’s really rental inflation."
 Or the PCE [inflation] calculation —the one we look at.
 And what that ’s telling you is that market rents are increasing at a much lower rate or even being flat and that that will show up in inflation over time.
  And just real quick—what is your response to the letter that was sent to you by some members of Congress asking the F ed to lower interest rates to make housing more affordable?
" My response is what I started with, which is that our , our job—the job Congress has given us is price stability and maximum employment."
" And so someone —for someone like that, high inflation in the —in the  necessities of life—right away , you’ re in trouble, whereas even middle -class  people have  some , you know, some scope to absorb higher costs."
" It’s what society has asked January 31, 2024   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 21 of 27   us to do, is to get inflation down , and t he tools that we use to do it are interest rates."
" In both cases, that ’s normalization, but from a strict monetary policy standpoint, you could say we ’re loosening along with tightening."
" You ’ve mentioned six good months of inflation data, but that not being enough to build up confidence."
"  Roughly how many months do you think you might need of , of good inflation  data to be —to be  confident?"
" And w e want to get that right, and we feel like the strong economy, strong labor market, inflation coming down—it gives us the ability to do that."
" We think that ’s the best way we can serve the public, because , ultimately, we, we ’ve made a lot of progress on inflation."
" We have—t his year is going to be a highly consequential year for , for the F ed and for monetary policy."
" As you mentioned, core PCE  [inflation] has been running at 1.9 percent over the past six months ."
" And you guys are actually expecting core inflation higher this year , at 2.4 percent , compared to that six -month measure."
" Given that forecast and that the median is for three rate cuts this year, what happens if inflation stays where it ’s been over the last six months for the next six months?"
" So I —you know, we’re going to do—w e’ll update our , our inflation forecasts at the next meeting."
" If, if  we get —if we get  very strong inflation data and it , it kicks back up, then it’ll—then we ’ll go slower or later or both."
" If we got really good inflation data soon, that would matter for both the —that, that would  tell us that, that  we could go sooner and perhaps go faster."
"  But just to follow —if inflation stays where it is currently, that would probably mean that the real interest rate becomes more restrictive."
"  Well, I think if we —if we  came to the view that , that inflation were —that the six -month inflation numbers, which are very close to 2 [percent] , were , in “ PCE world ”—if we came to —if that’s —if we thought that is really where we ’re going to be, then, yes, our policy would be in a different place."
" But , you know, that ’s the whole point is , we’re trying to get comfortable and gain confidence that that is where —that inflation is on a sustainable path down to 2 percent or toward 2 percent."
" And , you know, do you think that inflation and falling inflation perhaps has played a role in that?"
" Yeah, so it ’s been —it’s been  interesting that confidence surveys have been weak , at a time when unemployment has been low —very low, historically low —for a couple of years."
" And it ’s fine that inflation is coming down, but the price —the prices they ’re paying are still high."
 That can —that can  support spending—can support economic activity.
" Just kind of looking to put it all together :  You talked about basically the , the economy looking strong with 3.3 percent annualized growth in the fourth quarter."
 Does the strength of the economy speak more loudly to you now than any inflation threat might?
" And also, perhaps, are you worried at all that the economy is maybe a little too strong right now and that inflation could come back at some point?"
" You know, it’s —again, we ’ve had inflation come down without a slow economy and without , you know, important increases in , in unemployment, and there ’s no reason why we should want to get in the way of that process , if it’s going to continue."
" So I , I am —you know, I  think—I think  declining inflation —continued declines in inflation  are, are really the main thing we ’re looking at."
 We don’ t have a growth mandate.
" We ’ve got a , a maximum -employment mandate and a , a price -stability mandate, and those are the two things we look at."
 Growth only matters to the extent it influences our achievement of those two—of those two mandates.
