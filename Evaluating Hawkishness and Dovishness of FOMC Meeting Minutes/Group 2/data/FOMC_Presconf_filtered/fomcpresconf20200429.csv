" Millions of workers are losing their jobs :  Next week’s jobs report is expected to show that the unemployment rate, which was at 50 -year lows just two months ago, has surged into double  digits."
" Overall, economic activity will likely drop at an unprecedented rate in the second quarter."
" Inflation is also being held down, reflecting weaker demand as well as significantly lower energy prices."
"The Federal Reserve’s response is guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to promote the stability of the financial system."
 Last month we quickly lowered our policy interest rate to near zero.
 We stated then and again today that we expect to maintain interest rates at this level until we ’re confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve our maximum -employment and price -stability goals.
"Of course, lowering interest rates cannot stop the sharp drop in economic activity caused by closures and other forms of social distancing."
" To support the flow of credit to households and businesses, foster smooth market functioning, and promote effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions, we have been purchasing large amounts of Treasury and agency mortgage -backed securities."
" With enhanced unemployment insurance and the P aycheck P rotection P rogram, we ’ve seen an extraordinary , historically large reaction."
" I want to follow up on Jeanna ’s question and ask, what specifically do you think elected officials should consider in order to help return or hasten a stronger return to full employment?"
" In addition, you know, we ’ve had—we’ve had extensive discussions, as I ’ve mentioned—done a lot of thinking about what monetary policy might look like over —in coming months over a range of potential scenarios for the economy."
" It says:  “ [The] ongoing public health crisis will weigh heavily on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near  term and poses considerable risks  to the economic outlook over the medium term."
" The first is that, in the near term, we ’re going to see, you know, significant declines in economic activity, significant declines in employment, and increases in unemployment."
 And probably the economic activity will pick  up as consumer spending picks up.
" So it may take some time for us to get back— it probably will take some time for us to get back  to—you know, to a more normal level of unemployment and—and, ultimately , to maximum employment."
 You  didn’ t firm up your guidance on—this is James Politi from the Financial Times —you didn ’t firm up your guidance on interest rates at this meeting .
" Then , on the credit facilities, what kind of demand are you expecting for the progr ams that were set up under the Cares Act, and are you expecting them to rapidly reach capacity like the PPP plan did?"
"  I’ve—I’ve  also mentioned now a couple  times that we have done a lot of thinking about what monetary policy might look like over coming months, and that would, you know, depend on—on where we are in —in a range of potential economic scenarios."
" S o we ’ve said that  if—if demand for our facilities is greater than we ’ve estimated, then we ’ll expand them."
"So we —for that reason, the ultimate demand for the facilities is quite difficult to predict, because there is this announcement effect that reall y gets the market functioning again."
" First, this time, now, is going to be a time of sharp contraction in economic activity, high unemployment ."
 Unemployment moved up.
" W e’ll see unemployment go down, we ’ll see economic activity pick up."
" So the —the sooner we get the virus under control, the sooner people can regain that confidence and regain their economic activity."
 So unemployment has tended to go up much faster for minorities and for others who are—tend to be at the low end of the income spectrum.
 So I don’ t know that the demand will be quite as strong as —as it has been for the PPP.
" Now, given the amount of stimulus on the fiscal side and monetary policy side, how much weight do you give to finding a vaccine , from clearing that uncertainty you talked about around treatment and whatnot , for the Federal Reser ve pulling back on some of the F ed’s actions and raising the rates from the zero lower bound?"
" I know you said that it ’s highly uncertain but, you know, there are analysts who think that we ’ll have very high unemployment until even the end of next year, as high as 9 percent."
" And , at this point, what —can you just talk a little bit more about what you see as the path of employment in the coming months and into next year?"
 So unemployment ’s going to go up to a high number in the second quarter —uncertain what the number will be.
" When —and that ’s because so much economic activity has been shuttered , really , as we take social -distancing measures."
" And once that  starts to happen, people will get hired back and unemployment will go back down."
" I think it will take some time for that to happen, for  us to get back to anything that resembles maximum employment."
" Mr. Chairman, given the demand drop, demand shock, and the drop in oil prices, do you anticipate that we mi ght see any kind of deflation, even for a very short period, that would require a Fed response?"
" In terms of inflation, we think that inflation is very closely and strongly related to inflation expectations."
" Inflation  expect —inflation  tended to move down a little bit, as it will when demand is weak."
 And —but inflation expectations did not move strongly down here in the United States.
" The re’s been downward pressure on inflation, really , for several decades now."
" So, I would say, as long as inflation expectations remain anchored, then we shouldn’ t see deflation."
" I think you asked, really , about headline inflation."
" If —if low energy prices—very low energy prices were to —were to  drop headline inflation negative, I—I would hope that people would see through that —and w e’ll be monitoring it  very carefully —would see through it , though, and look to core , which is a better predictor of future inflation."
 I wanted to start on the unemployment picture and nail down a little bit how you see —how you see  things going from here.
" So are you worried about structural changes in job markets that would keep unemployment high and, therefore, potenti ally beyond the ability of the F ed to do anything about, which is  something that was debated, as you know, after the last recession , and then eventually, of course, the unemployment rate did go lower than people thought ?"
" I t sounds like you want to keep that in reserve for programs that have high demand, such as the Main Street program."
" Chair Powell, I ’m wondering what you would say to savers who are hurt by very low interest rates and April 29, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  Page 23 of 24  maybe going into investments maybe in the stock market that aren ’t so great for them."
" And also, I’m wondering if you can give us any more of a clue as to how long you think we ’re going to have interest rates near zero ."
 So we think that low interest rates affect the economy through a number of channels in a positive way.
" Lower interest rates support economic activity through channels that we —overall, through channels that we understand reasonably well."
" But for people who are really, really just relying on their bank savings account earnings, this is —you know, that ’s—that’s —you’ re not going to benefit from low interest rates."
" Low interest rates suppor t employment, they support economic activity, and those are our mandates."
" And I think for the overall good of the economy, low interest rates are a good thing."
