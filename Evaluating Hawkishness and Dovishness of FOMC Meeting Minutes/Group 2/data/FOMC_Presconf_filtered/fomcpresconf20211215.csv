" At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed to achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us:  maximum employment and price stability."
" Today, in support of these goals, the Federal Open Market Committee kept interest rates near zero and  updated its assessment of the progress that the economy has made toward the criteria specified in the Committee’s forward guidance for interest rates."
" In addition, in light of the strengthening labor market and elevated inflation pres sures, we decided to speed up the reductions in our asset purchases."
" As I will explain, economic developments and changes in the outlook warrant this evolution of  monetary policy , which will continue to provide appropriate support for  the econom y."
"  Economic activity is on track to expand at a robust pace this year , reflecting progress on vaccinations  and the reopening of the economy."
" A ggregate demand remains very strong, buoyed by fiscal and monetary policy support and the healthy financial positions of households and businesses."
" Notwithstanding the effects of the virus and supply constraints, FOMC participants continue to foresee rapi d growth."
" A s shown in our Summary of Economic Projections  (SEP) , the median projection for real GDP growth stands at 5.5 percent this year and 4 percent next year."
" Amid improving labor market conditions and very strong demand for workers, the economy has been making rapid progress toward maximum employment ."
" The unemployment rate has declined substantially —falling 6/10 of a percentage point since our last December 15, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 2 of 31   meeting and reaching 4.2 percent in November."
" The recent improvements in labor market conditions have narrowed the differences in employment across groups, especially for workers at the lower end of the wage distribution, as well as for African Americans a nd Hispanics."
" Looking ahead, FOMC participants project the labor market to continue to improve, with the median projection for the unemployment rate declining to 3.5 percent by the end of the year."
" Compared with the projections made in September, participants have revised their unemployment rate projections noticeably lower for this year and next ."
Supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic and [to] the reopening of the economy have continued to contribute to elevated levels of inflation.
" In particular, bottlenecks and supply constraints  are limiting how quickly production can respond to higher demand in the near term."
" As a result, overall inflation is running well above our 2 percent longer -run goal and will likely continue to do so well int o next year ."
" While the drivers of higher inflation have been predominantly connected to the dislocations caused by the pandemic , price increases have now spread to a broader range of goods and services."
" Wages have also risen briskly, but , thus far, wage growth has not been a major contributor to the elevated levels of inflation."
" We are attentive to the risks that persistent real wage growth in excess of productivity [growth] could put December 15, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 3 of 31   upward pressure on inflation."
" Like most forecasters, we continue to e xpect inflation to decline to levels closer to our 2 percent longer -run goal  by the end of next year ."
 The median inflation projection of  FOMC participants falls from 5.3 percent this year to 2.6 percent next year ; this trajectory is notably higher than pr ojected in September .
"We understand that high inflation im poses significant hardship, especially on those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food , housing, and transportation."
 We will use our tools both to support the economy and a strong labor market and to prevent higher inflation from becoming entrenched.
 The Fed’s monetary policy actions hav e been guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.
" With inflation having exceeded 2 percent for some time, the Committee expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor ma rket conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessments of maximum employment ."
" We are phasing out our purchases more rapidly because, with elevated inflation pressures and a rapidly strengthening labor market,  the economy no longer needs increasing amounts of policy support."
 We at the Fed will do everything we can to complete the recovery in employment and achieve our price -stability goal.
" The latest FOMC materials say that the FOMC thinks it will be appropriate December 15, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 5 of 31   to keep rates near zero until labor market conditions reach levels consistent with maximum employment."
" In order to set up those hikes, what will maximum employment have to look like?"
" So maximum employment, if you look at our S tatement on L onger -Run G oals and M onetary P olicy S trategy, maximum employment is something that we look at a broad range of indicators."
" And those would include, of course, things like the unemployment rate, the labor force participation rate, job openings, wages, flows in and out of the labor force in various parts of the labor force."
" The Committee will make a judgmen t that we ’ve achieved labor market conditions consistent with maximum employment when it makes that —it is , admittedly , a judgment call because it ’s a range of factors."
" U nlike inflation, where we have one number that sort of dominates , it’s a broad range o f things."
" So, as I  mentioned in my opening remarks, in my view, we are making rapid progress toward maximum employment."
 My question is :  If—It’s often said that monetary policy has long and variable lags .
" How does continuing to buy assets now, even though it ’s at a slower pace, address the current inflation problem?"
 Won’ t the impac t of today’ s changes not really have any impact for six months or a year down the road on the current inflation problem?
" And a ren’t you actually lengthening that time by continuing to buy assets December 15, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 6 of 31   such that it could be not until the long and variable lag after you end purchases sometime in March that you ’ll start to have any impact on the inflation problem?"
" Chair Powell, I’ m curious exactly how much distance you think there should be between the end of the taper and the first interest rate increase."
" And the economy is so much stronger now, so much closer to full employment."
" Inflation is running well above target , and growth is  well above  potential."
" Chair Powell, in March you answered a question about maximum employment like this :  You said 4 percent  would be a nice unemployment rate to get to, but it ’ll take more than that to get to maximum employment."
" More recently, you have hinted at a possible distinction between the level of maximum employment that ’s achievable in the short run versus in the long run."
 Has your view of the level of maximum employment changed this year?
 And how close is the economy right now to your judgment of the short -run level of maximum employment?
" So I would s ay:  Look, we ’re, we’re  at 4.2 percent now and it ’s been —the unemployment rate has been dropping very quickly."
"  December 15, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 9 of 31   The way in which—The important metric that has been disappointing really has been labor force p articipation, of course, where we had widely thought —I had certainly thought —that, last fall , as unemployment insurance ran off , as vaccinations increased, [and] as schools reopened, that we would see a significant surge, if you will, or at least a surge , in labor force participation."
" And, in fact, that ’s, that’s  been the pattern in past cycles —that labor force participation has  tend ed to recover in the wake of a strong recovery in unemployment, which is what we ’re getting right now."
 And inflation is well above  target.
 And so does that mean that the Committee might feel compelled to raise interest rates bef ore you’ re convinced that you’ ve achieved the employment test in your forward guidance?
" And, yes, ther e is a—there ’s a provision, it used to be called the “ balanced approach”  provision , that says, in effect, that in situations in which the pursuit of the maximum -employment goal and [the pursuit of] the December 15, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 10 of 31   price -stability goal are  not complementary, we have to take account of the distance from the goal and the —and the  speed at which we ’re approaching it."
" It, it  is a provision that would enable us to, in this case, because of high inflation, move before achieving maximum employment."
" Now, we’re—as I said, we’ re making rapid progress toward maxim um employment in my —in my  thinking, in my opinion."
" A nd that will depend, you know, on how much it suppresses demand as opposed to suppressing supply."
" It is not clear how big the effects would be on either inflation or growth or hiring on top of what ’s already going on, which is quite a strong, you know, wave  of Delta that’ s hitting large parts of the country across the northern United States and all the way to the eastern seaboard and now coming down."
" Yes, look, I think— if you look at the state of the economy and the amount —the strength of demand, the strength of just overall demand, and the strength of demand for labor, look at inflation, lo ok at wages ."
 I wonder if you could talk a little bit about what prompted your recent pivot toward greater wariness around inflation .
" Inflation really popped up, right ?"
" Certainly, we had five months of decl ining month on month— monthly readings of inflation, but we didn’ t see much in the way of progress on labor supply or on other supplyside issues."
" Then in September, I ’d say after Labor Day, we started to see—it started to become clear that this was both l arger in its effect on inflation and more persistent."
" December 15, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 13 of 31   So com ing to your real question, we got the ECI reading on the eve of the November meeting —it was the Friday before the November meeting —and it was very high, 5.7 percent reading for the employment compensation index for the third quarter, not annual ized, for the third quarter, just before the meeting."
"”  Then , right after that, we got the next Friday after the meeting, two days after the meeting, we got a very strong employment report and, you know, revisions to prior readings and, and no increase in labor supply."
 It was essentially higher inflation and faster —turns out much faster progress in the labor market.
" Really, what ’s happening is the unemployment rate is catching up— seems to be catching up—with a lot of the other readings of a tight labor market, 6/10  [declin e] over one cycle."
" If I could just follow up  quickly, you noted that the ECI was one of the things that made you nervous, but you also said earlier that you don ’t see signs that wages are actually factoring into inflation yet."
" It’s, it’s—so far, we don’ t see—wages are not a big part of the highinflation story that we ’re seeing."
" But what , what  that leaves behind is the other things that can lead to persistent inflation."
" In particul ar—we don’ t see this yet , but if you had something where wages were persistently—[increases in] real wages were persistently above productivity growth, that puts upward pressure on, on firms , and they raise prices."
" Unlike the things that are causing the inflation now , this is economically sensitive —and so would be expected to move up."
" Well, next  year, you could see growth slowing, and you could see some disinflation, particularly if the Omicron variant does spread more widely."
" And also, how would you explain rate  hikes if you do follow through, in that kind of situation, with inflation fading and growth slowing?"
" And so the m edian —what you’ re talking about, the three rate increases, that’s the median of the Committee —the median of the Committee is also that growth will be 4 percent and then unemployment will be 3½ percent by the end of the year."
" B ut we ’d have to—you know, we look at our two goals, maximum employment and price stability, and we make policy based on them, and not with respect to what we wrote down in a prior SEP."
 I wanted to follow up on maximum employment.
" So, you know, the new framework was basically designed, as I understand it, so that there was a deemphasis on guessing where inflation would pick up because of employment."
" And, basically, you were going to wait until you saw the whites of the eyes of inflation."
 And that’s how you would kind of know that you reached maximum employment.
" So, I ’m wondering, you know, you’ ve talked a lot about the different ways that you might measure maximum employment ."
" But from what I understand, that ’s still basically :  The way that you know that you’ re there is inflation."
" And how is —are those signals likely to be clear right now given that you have inflation that ’s caused by, you know, these supply chain disruptions that might also lead to, you know, inflation in wages and those sorts of things?"
" So how do you sort of, like, tease out the signal of maximum employment?"
 So let me st art by saying that the inflation that we got was not at all the inflation we were looking for or talking about in the framework.
" It was to do with, you know, strong monetary policy and fiscal stimulus into an economy that was recovering rapidly, and in which there were these supplyside barriers which effectively led to, you know, in certain parts of the economy, what you might call a vertical supply curve."
" So, you know, automobile purchases are very i nterest  ratesensitive , and you would think demand would drive up the quantity of cars ,  But it can ’t, because they don’ t have semiconductors."
" So , so that —it was a very different kind of inflation."
 This is not the inflation we were looking for under our framework at all.
" But com ing to maximum employment, which is really your question."
" When you—i f you want to look at maximum employment, you look at prices and quantities, and the main price you look at is wages."
" You can get to 20, if you wanted to,  easily, but labor force participation, the unemployment rate, different age groups of —you know, prime -age labor force participation, in particular, gets a lot of focu s, the JOLTS data get a lot of focus."
" So on wages, that ’s the price indicator we look at to tell us, along  with all the other data, whether we ’re—whether we have labor market conditions that are consistent with maximum December 15, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 17 of 31   employment."
" Do we —if we think we can make labor , you know, participation might move up—i f we, let’s say we knew that it would start to move up in two years, would we wait two years when inflation is running way above target?"
" Probably not, you know, so you have to make an assessment that what ’s max—what is the level of maximum employment that is consistent with price stability in real time is , is one way to think about it."
" Just to kin d of follow up on that for a second, if you do raise interest rates next year and, you know, it ’s—you ’re not certain whether you’ re at maximum employment, are you all going to point —when you raise interest rates, are you going to point to ways in which the  labor market could still improve?"
" I , I think —well, whether or not we —whether or not we  say “ we’re at conditions —labor market conditions consistent with , with  maximum employment ” next year, we would all be open a nd I think expect, over time, that the level of maximum employment that ’s consistent with price stability would increase further over time—for example, through increasing participation."
" But, again, with inflation as high as it is, we have to make policy in real time."
" You know, usually, in every other expansion, it ’s that there aren ’t enough jobs and people can ’t find jobs and, you know, we ’re stimulating demand and trying to get demand to come up."
" But, again, ultimately, we have the tools  that we have, which are essentially to stimulate demand and also to control inflation."
" I mean, really, it might be —one of the two big threats to getting back to maximum employment is actually high inflation, because , to get back to where we were, the evi dence grows that it ’s going to take some time."
" How concerned or what is your level of concern the consumer may be turning away from this economy or pulling back because of inflation, the virus , or something else?"
" I don’ t know, Edward, whether you’ re talking about more shopping online versus shopping in the store, but consumer demand is very strong, incomes are very strong, you know, because people are going back to work and they’ re getting wage increases."
" Admittedly, some of the wage increases is being eaten away by inflation."
" But, n onetheless, incomes, overall, are going up really significantly because of increased employment and spending is—has been strong."
" Mr. Chairman, the median forecast for inflation in this month ’s or this meeting ’s economic projections has been revised up significantly for 2021 but barely move d for 2022 and 2023."
 Is that because you ’re going to raise interest rates or because the virus is going to fade and the effects are going to fade?
" In other words, is it a question of when, not if, you raise interest rates?"
" So, actually, I ’m looking at the SEP here , and the median forecasts for core and headline inflation did move up by 4/10 each."
" If you look at where B lue C hip forecasts are —which is, you know, a group of well -resourced, large forecasting operations with a December 15, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 22 of 31   long track record—they ’ll show inflation coming back down significantly toward the back -end of next year."
"  There ’s a real risk now, we believe, I believe, that inflation may be more persistent and that may be putting inflation expectations under pressure , and that the risk of higher inflation becoming entrenched has increased ."
" We need to see how the inflation data and  the—all the data evolve in coming months, but we are prepared to, you know, to use our tools to make sure that higher inflation doesn’ t get entrenched."
" For one reason, as I —as I  just mentioned, it’ s one of the two big threats, the other being the pandemi c itself, to getting back to maximum employment."
" Going back to inflation, is the Fed “ behind the curve ” on getting inflation under control?"
" And I think if you look at how we got here, I do think we ’ve, we’ve  been adapting to the i ncoming data, really all the way along , and, you know, noticing and calling out that , that  the—both the effects and the persistence of inflation of bottlenecks and labor shortages and things like that."
" And now we ’re in a position where we ’re ending our taper within the next —well, by March , in two meetings, and we ’ll be in a position to raise interest rates as and when we think it ’s appropriate."
 I think that the data that we got toward the end of the fall was a—was a really strong signal that inflation is more persistent and higher —and that the risk of it remaining higher for longer has grown.
" S o I wouldn’ t look at it that we ’re “behind the  curve.”   I would look at it that we ’re actually in position now to take the steps that we ’ll need to take, you know, in a thoughtful manner to address all of the issues, including that of , of toohigh inflation."
 I was wondering if we should still be seeing the taper and interest rate hikes as separate.
" And , secondly, in the last cycle, t he Fed December 15, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 26 of 31   started shrinking the balance sheet when short -term interest rates were about 1 to 1¼ percent range."
" So the —you know, the , the asset purchases are a separate tool from interest rates."
"  I don’ t think that, that —the last cycle, there was quite a long separation before interest rates."
" We ’re in a very, very different place with high inflation, strong growth, a really strong economy."
" You know, that —as I mentioned, the SEP medians are for 4 percent growth next year, 3½  percent —3½ percent  unemployment at the end of the year, and the, the —you know, headline inflation of 2.6 percent next year, core at 2.7.  So thi s is a strong economy, one in which it ’s appropriate for, for interest rate hikes."
 I think you said a few minutes ago that the inflation that we got during the pandemic was not the inflation that we —that you anticipated when you crafted the framework.
"  Does that mean the stimulus was mistaken , or is the inflation just a consequence of —that we have to put up with because of that?"
" What I ’m saying is , there ’s a— there’s a sense among some that “ you wanted inflation, this is what you wanted, how do you like it ?,” you know?"
" And the truth is, this is not the inflation that we were —what we were talking about in the —in the  framework was inflation that comes from a tight labor market, right?"
" So we had 3½ percent unemployment for a period , and we had inflation that was just barely getting to 2 percent."
" And I —you know, I think, in that setting, our thinking wa s, we can afford to wait to raise rates until we see actual inflation rather than [acting] preempt ive[ly] because, you know, no one had seen what 3½ percent unemployment would look like —with high labor force participation, by the way."
" And we didn’ t December 15, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 28 of 31   know what the inflationary implications were ."
 It turned out  there was barely 2 percent inflation —and no sense that it was gaining momentum and that kind of thing.
" You know, that ’s a situation where you had a very, very high level of employment and low inflation."
" Or, you know, it has been the opposite , where we have very high inflation and we ’ve had it since the labor market was in terrible shape."
"  It had nothing —so far, this inflation has really nothing to do with tightness in the labor market."
"  It does have to do with, with  strong demand, and strong demand was supported by the Fed, it was supported by Congress."
" And what ’s coming out now is, is, you know, really strong growth, really strong demand, high incomes, and all that kind of thing."
" When you see the 10year at 146 basis points, do you have any sort of concerns about an environment by which you might be hiking interest rates into?"
" So, in a way, it ’s not surprising that there ’s a lot of demand for , for U.S. sovereigns in a world —you know, in  a risk -free world where , where  there ’s so much —they’ re yielding so much more than bunds are,  than JGBs.   So that ’s, that’s  a big part of it."
" You know, I mean, we ’re really focused on broader financial conditions, [and] we ’re focused on maximum employment and price stability."
" I guess that some people are saying that it was the, you know, the stimulus in March that was sort of over —we didn’ t really need all that stimulus , and that there was talk even then that that would be a mistak e and it would lead to higher inflation."
