" My colleagues and I are strongly committed to bringing inflation back down, and we ’re moving expeditiously to do so."
"  From the standpoint of our c ongressional mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability, the current picture is plain to  see:  The labor market is extremely tight, and inflation is much too high."
" Against this backdrop, today the F OMC raised its policy interest rate by ¾ of a percentage point and anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range for the federal funds r ate will be appropriate."
 And I’ll have more to say about today’s monetary policy actions after briefly reviewing economic developments.
" Growth in consumer spending has slowed significantly, in part reflecting lower real disposable income and tighter financial conditions."
"    Despite these developments, the labor market has remained extremely tight, with the unemployment rate near a 50year low, job vacancies near historical highs, and wage growth elevated."
" Over the past three months, employment rose by an average of 375,000 jobs per July 27, 202 2   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 2 of 29   month—down from the average pace seen earlier in the year , but still robust."
" Labor demand is very strong, while labor supply remains subdued,  with the labor force participation rate little changed since January."
" Overall, the continued strength of the labor market suggests that underlying aggregate demand remains solid."
 Inflation remains well above our longerrun goal of 2 percent.
" Notwi thstanding the recent slowdown in overall economic activity, aggregate demand appears to remain strong, supply constraints have been larger and longer lasting than anticipated, and price pressures are evident across a broad range of goods and services."
 The Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.
" My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship, especially on those least abl e to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation."
" We are highly attentive to the risks high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective."
" And we ’re continuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet, which p lays an important role in firming the stance of monetary policy."
" Over coming months, we will be looking for compelling evidence that inflation is moving down, consistent with inflation returning to 2 percent."
" As the stance of monetary policy tightens further, it likely will become appropriate to slow the pace of increases while we assess how our cumulative policy adjustments are affecting the economy and i nflation."
 Our overarching focus is using our tools to bring demand into better balance with supply in order to bring inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keep longer -term inflation expectations well anchored.
 Making appropriate monetary policy  in this uncertain environment requires a recognition that the economy often involves —evolves in unexpected ways.
" Inflation has obviously surprised to the upside over the past year, and further surprises could be in store."
" We are highly attentive to inflation risks and determined to take the measu res necessary to return July 27, 202 2   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 4 of 29   inflation to our 2 percent longer -run goal."
 This process is likely to involve a period of below -trend economic growth and some softening in labor market conditions .
 But such outcomes are likely necessary to restore price stability  and to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer  run.
 We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum -employment and price -stability goals.
" We, we  had said many times that we were prepared to move aggressively, more aggressively, if inflation continued to disapp oint."
" July 27, 202 2   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 5 of 29   At this meeting, we continued at that more aggressive pace , as inflation has continued to disappoint , in the form of the June CPI reading."
" As the C ommittee considers the policy path forward, how will it weigh the expected decline in headline inflation , which might come as a result o f the drop in commodity prices, against the fact that we are likely to see some persistence in core readings, in particular?"
 So one thing that hasn’ t changed is that —won ’t change —is that our focus is continuing to—is going to continue to be on using our tools to bring demand back into better balance with supply in order to bring inflation back down.
" You know, w e’ll be looking at the incoming data , as I mentioned, and that ’ll start with economic activity."
" And we ’ll be asking whether we see the alignment between supply and demand getting better, getting closer."
"  Of cour se, we’ ll be looking closely at inflation."
" But we look at core because core is, is  actually a better indicator of headline a nd of all inflation going forward."
 But we ’ll be asking:  D o we see inflationary pressures declining?
 Do we see actual readings of inflation coming down?
" So, in light of all that data, the question we ’ll be asking is whether the stance of policy we have is sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation back down to our 2 percent  target."
 Are these expectations consistent with the need to keep financial conditions tight in order to moderate purchasing power and bring inflation back to 2 percent ?
" And to try to predict what the appropriate monetary policy would respond—response would be —of course, we do that in the SEP, but , nonetheless, you’ ve got to take any estimates of what rates will be next year with a grain of salt , because there ’s so much uncertainty."
" Since then, inflation has come in higher ; economic activity has come in weaker than expected."
 You said inflation had been a little bit hotter than anticipated.
" Obviously, it has evolved over the course —I think , for all participants, it has evolved over the course of the year a s we learn how persistent inflation ’s going to be."
" And by the time of the September meeting, we will have seen two more CPI readings and two more labor market readings and a significant amount of readings about economic activity and perhaps geopolitical developments, who knows."
"  You kind of alluded to this earlie r, but I wonder in the event that you see several months of very weak headline inflation numbers because oil prices are coming down so much, but core inflation continues to be strong or even picks up, I wonder how you would think about that ."
" We, you know, we  would look at both, and we would ask—we ’d be asking ourselves , are we confident that inflation is on a path down to 2 percent ?"
" And we ’ll be making—you know, our policy stance will be set at a level, ultimately, at which we are confident that inflation is going to be moving down to 2 percent ."
" Of course, as I mentioned, core inflation is a bett er predictor of inflation going forward ."
 Headline inflation tends to be volatile.
" The problem with the current situation is that, that  if you have a sustained period of supply shocks, those can actually start to undermine or to work—to work on deanchoring inflation expectations."
 The public doesn’ t distinguish between core and headline inflation in their thinking.
 Or is  there some amount of contraction of the economy the Committee would be willing to abide in its effort to reduce inflation?
" So, as I —as I  mentioned, we think it ’s necessary to have growth slow  down."
" And growth is going to be slowing down this year for a couple of reasons , one of which is that you’ re coming off of the very high growth of the reopening year of 2021."
 You ’re also seeing tighter monetary policy.
 We actually think we need a period of growth below potential  in order to create some slack so that —so that  the supply side can catch up.
 And we think that they ’re probably necessary if we were to have— to get inflation —if we were to be able to get inflation back down on a  path to 2 percent  and ultimately get there.
" So we ’re going to be —again, we ’re going to be focused on getting inflation back down."
" We all want to get back to the kind of labor market we had before the pandemic , where differences between , you know, racial and gender differences and that kind of thing were at historic minimums, where participation was high, where inflation was low."
 We see it as a way to facilitate the sustained achievement of the employment mandate in the longer term.
" We think that there ’s a path for us to be able to bring inflation down while sustaining a strong labor market , as I mentioned , along with —in all likelihood —some , some  softening in labor market conditions."
" There would be the risk of doing too much and, you know, imposing more of a downturn on the economy than, than was necessary, but the risk —the ris k of doing too little and leaving the economy with this entrenched inflation, it only raises the cost."
  They start to factor high inflation into their decisions —when that —on a sustained basis.
" As I me ntioned, it’s true that growth is slowing f or reasons that we understand."
" Really , the growth was extraordinarily high last year, 5 ½ percent."
 We would have expected growth to slow.
" But if you look at the labor market, you ’ve got growth—I think, payroll jobs averaging  450,000 per month."
 The unemployment rate at near a 50 -year low at 3.6 percent .
" And th en, kind of along those lines, is there any sort of weakness in the economy , outside of inflation measures , that would lead you to slow your hiking pace?"
" So, as I mentioned, we ’re going to be looking at all of those things :  activity, labor market, inflation."
" I wanted to ask about right now , there ’s a sort of growing gap between the F ed’s preferred measure of inflation, the PCE , PCE index, a nd the one that ’s followed by the public, the CPI, of course."
" Of course, we’ ve, we’ve  long used PCE because we think it ’s just better at capturing the inflation that people actually face in their lives."
 Or is demand still greater than supply —too much greater than supply that you need to do significantly more?
" And I ask be cause there are lags in the impact of monetary policy, as y ou mentioned."
" Well, just talking about demand for a  second :   As I mentioned in my remarks, I think you pretty clearly do see a slowing now in demand in the second quarter —consumer spending, business fixed investment, housing, places like that."
" The truth is, though, we , we think that demand is moderating."
 The unemployment rate is ver y low.
" Of course, as I mentioned, we do want to see demand running below potential for a sustained period to create slack and, and give inflation a chance to come down."
 An d how much weakness will it accept with regard to slower job growth and higher unemployment before it pauses or begins to think about cutting rates?
" And we ’ll be getting the employment compensation index measurement , I think, on Friday, I guess."
" So executive summary [is]:  I would say t here’s some evidence that labor demand may be slowing a bit —labor supply, not so much."
" Nonetheless, I would say some , some  progress on demand and  supply gettin g back in alignment."
"  So I think we’re looking— we’re going to be looking at , at inflation as well."
" You know, a s I mentioned, we need to see inflation coming down."
" We need to be July 27, 202 2   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 19 of 29   confident that inflation is going to get back down to mandate -consistent levels."
" And, but we do think, though, that the labor ma rket can adjust because of the huge overhang of job openings , of excess demand, really."
" There should be able to be an adjustment that would have lower than—perhaps lower -thanexpected increases in unemployment —lower than would be expected in the ordinary course of events because the level —the ratio of, of  vacancies to unemployed is just out of keeping with historical experience."
" And I think you do see weakening, some slowdown—let ’s put it that way —in growth."
" So, overall, you would say that , in all probability, demand i s still strong , and, and the economy is still on track to continue to grow this year."
" If there is a path to it, and we think there is, it is the one I mentioned , that the labor market actually is —has  such a large amount of surplus demand that you could see —you could see that demand coming down in a way that didn ’t translate into a big increase in unemployment as you would expect in the ordinary course because , frankly, the imbalance is so much greater."
" So a big piece of that is inflation expectations —you know, breakevens coming down, w hich, you know, is a good thing."
" It’s a good thing that markets do seem to have confidence in , in the C ommittee ’s commitment to getting inflation back down to 2 percent ."
" So we like to see market -based , you know, readings  of inflation expectations come down."
" We’ re going to— we’re going to get our policy rate to a level where  we’re confident that July 27, 202 2   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 22 of 29   inflation will be moving back down to 2 percent ."
" And , of course, we ’ll be watching financial conditions to see that they are appropriately tight and that they’ re having the effect th at we would hope they’ re having, which is to see demand moderate and inflationary pressures recede and , ultimately , inflation come down."
" I wonder if you can go back a little bit in time to before there was this outbreak of inflation , when the Committee put in place forward guidance on tapering asset purchases."
" There ’s a recent speech by Fed Governor Waller talking about that a nd saying that maybe that was too tight, that kind of condition, and it put you a little bit behind— not his words but maybe , you know, were kind of late to react to some of that inflation."
" You’ll never get inflation to 2 percent .”  Some of our critics now who say inflation’ s too tight —too high were the same ones who were saying , “You’ll never get to 2  percent .”  Well, but anyway , that’s what happened."
" W hen inflation changed direction, really, in October , we’ve moved quickly since then."
" But before then, inflation was coming down month by month."
 This is a much stronger economy and much higher inflation than we ’ve been thinking.
" You know, w e’re focused on the dual mandate and using our tools to achieve maximum employment and price stability."
" Within the F ed, there are staff economists who ’ve argue d that N AIRU, the noninflationary rate of unemployment, might be as high as 5 to 6 percent  right now , which obviously is a lot higher than the current rate of 3.6.  What ’s your assessment of N AIRU?"
"  So I think, broadly, a lot of economists think that the —that the  natural  rate of unemployment will have moved up to some significant extent above where we think it was before."
" And the reason is there’s —it’ s the usual matching issue , where m atching has become less effective, and that kind of thing when you have the kind of turbulent downturn and July 27, 202 2   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 26 of 29   the big switches in demand from services to goods and all that."
 And my own instinct is that the natural rate of unemployment is higher.
" But the other side of that is , as all these jobs get created and people go back to work and unemployment is so low, I think you could, in principle, you could see it coming back down pretty significantly."
" And that would also, by the way, take pressure off of inflation b ecause it ’s that gap— it’s the gap between actual unemployment and the —and the  natural rate that really is relevant for, you know, the negative slack we have in the economy w ith the overtight labor market."
" It’s an unobservabl e, but you could actually be seeing inflationary pressures com ing down if that does happen."
" They ’re being told by folks like you and the Administration that we ’re not in a recession, we ’re not heading for a recession—frankly, coming from the same people who  told them inflation was transitory , telling them now that we ’re not heading for a recession."
" So, and I mentioned that , that —I also said that our goal is to bring inflation down a nd have a so -called soft landing , by which I mean a landing that doesn’ t require a significant increase, a really significant increase in unemployment."
  The FOMC has historically trie d to avoid the kind of rapid monetary policy tightening that has happened so far this year.
 They ’re suffering from high inflation.
 And that ’s why we ’re—we’re  really committed to bringing down inflation—one of the reasons.
" So I guess the first thing I would say to , to every household is that we know that inflation is too high."
 We need growth to slow to below potential growth.
 It ’s what can—it can  give us a strong labor market and wages that aren ’t being eaten up by high inflation.
" If you talk to people —again, people who are making, you know, wages, relatively low wages—they’ re the ones who are suffering the most from inflation."
