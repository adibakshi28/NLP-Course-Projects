" In recent months, economic activity picked up as the economy began to reopen."
" The recovery in household spending also likely owes to federal stimulus payments and expanded unemployment benefits , which provided substantial and timely support to household incomes."
" After precipitous drops in March and April, employment rose s trongly in May and June as many people returned to work from temporary layoffs."
" The unemployment rate declined in May and July 29, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 2 of 29  June but, at 11.1 percent, remains far above its level before the outbreak and greater than the peak during the Global F inancial C risis."
The pandemic has also left a significant imprint on inflation.
" More broadly, however, w eaker demand, especially in sectors —such as travel and hospitality —that have been most affected by the pandemic, has held down consumer prices, and , overall, inflation is running well below our symmetric 2 percent objective."
 Along with the recent increases in economic activity have come new challenges.
" Indeed, we  have seen some signs in recent weeks that the increase in virus cases and the renewed measures to control it are starting to weigh on economic activity."
" For example, some measures of consumer spending based on debit  card  and credit card use have moved down since late June, while recent labor market indicators point to a slowing in job growth, especially among smaller businesses."
" The Federal Reserve ’s response to this crisis  has been  guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to promote the stability of the financial system."
 We have held our policy rate nea r zero  since mid -March and have stated that we will keep it there until we are confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve our maximum -employment and price -stability goals.
" To sustain smooth market functioning and foster effective transmission of monetary policy to broade r financial conditions, we will continue to increase our holdings of Treasury and agency mortgage -backed securities at least at the current pace."
" It will take a while to get back to the levels  of economic activity and employment that prevailed at the beginning of the year, and it will take continued support from both monetary and fiscal policy to achieve that."
" Before taking your questions, I ’ll provide an update on our review of our monetary policy framework."
" As a reminder, we began this public review of our monetary policy strategy, tools, and communication practices —a first for the Federal Reserve—early last year."
" Our purpose has been to take a comprehensive look at how we can best meet our July 29, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 5 of 29  maximum -employment and price -stability objectives in the years ahead, particularly in light of the generally lower level of interest rates around the world."
" As is evident in our current situation, the lower level of interest rates has reduced the scope for the Committee to support the economy by cutting interest rates."
 Our focus was on possible enhancements to our Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy.
" This doc ument states our goals, articulates our approach to monetary policy, and serves at the foundation—as the foundation for our policy actions."
 A nd a question they each answered had to do with the continuation of these pandemic unemployment benefits.
" We went from the lowest levels of unemployment we ’d had in 50 years to the highest levels we ’ve had in 90 years , and we did it in the space of two months ."
" So it ’s a serious economic problem for the United States, but it ’s—it’s  got underlying causes that are not rela ted to monetary policy or to our response to the pandemic ."
 Our part  of it is to —is to  push as hard as we can on our employment mandate while keeping price stability.
 We do feel that our curren t monetary policy stance is the appropriate one.
" So, as I mentioned, economic activity and employment picked up beginning in May and right through June and remained well  below their levels because, I ’d say , job gains have reversed about a third of the job losses from March and April, a nd consumer spending has reversed about a half of the drop."
" Recent labor market indicators point to a slowing in job growth, partic ularly among smaller businesses."
" We just don ’t know yet, because we have to wait for —to see the, you know, the actual data on spending and employment com e in, and —but this —this is what we ’re seeing, and , of course , we’re monitoring it very carefully ."
" And now that the—that the  cases have spiked again —again , the early data, the high -frequency data suggest that there is a slower pace of growth, at least for now ."
" And the tools you talk about are generally in service of keeping interest rates low , where they already are."
" So unless you were to go to negative interest rates, I ’m wondering what additional accommodation the Fed  can bring."
" And , as a follow, do you see a vaccine helping inflation get back to where you want it to be?"
"In terms of inflation, I don ’t know ."
" I mean, I —you know, I think, fundamentally, this is a disinflationary shock."
" I know there —there  is a lot of discussion about how this might lead to inflation over time , but, you know, we ’re—we’re  seeing disinflationary pressures around the world going into this ."
" Now  we see a big shock to demand, and we see core inflation dropping to 1 percent ."
 And I do think for quite some time we ’re going to be struggling against disinflationary pressures rather than against inflationary pressures.
 It really just is when we think it would help:   Would it help more than what we ’re doing now to foster maximum employment and stable prices?
 We think that the economy will need highly accommodative monetary policy and the use of our tools for an extended period.
" You mentioned earlier that the labor mark et we had in February was the best we’ ve had in 50 years, yet at that point the B lack unemployment rate was still double that of whites ."
" So I wanted to ask you, you know, we ’ve seen some economists and even  the Biden campaign call for the Fed  to more specifically target the gap between minority unemployment rates ."
" So, first,  on the unemployment, you’ re right ."
" While the aggr egate unemployment rate was 3 ½ percent , every —every  economy —every market in every economy has longer -run issues ."
 And one of ours is just the disparate level of unemployment between —between  Blacks and whites.
" So even—but this was the lowest, July 29, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 21 of 29  you know, B lack unemployment rate in 50 years —or, actually , sinc e we started keeping records, which was less than 50 years ago ."
"So we have started , though, in recent years to focus considerable time and attention on disparate levels of unemployment —for example, among—among different racial groups and demographic groups ."
 We call them out in testim ony and in speeches and in our Monetary Policy Report  to Congress .
 In terms of—so we do—you will see that —you will see that discussed —the B lack unemployment rate discussed all the time in what we do.
" I wonder, how big are the risks of the unemployment rate rising and job growth turning negative this summer?"
 And what we —it looks like we ’re seeing a slowdown in the rate of growth.
" In any case, there ’s clearly a risk that we ’re going to see a slowdown in the rate of growth in economic activity and in hiring."
 It—it  seems to indicate that inflation could be more volatile in coming—coming months and coming years.
 And would you consider both inflation and labor market conditions as part of those outcomes?
" And it can either be inflation or it could be an employment goal, as you pointed out ."
