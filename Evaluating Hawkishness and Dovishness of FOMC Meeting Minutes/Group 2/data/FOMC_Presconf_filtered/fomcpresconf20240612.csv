 My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on achieving our dual -mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices for the benefit of the American people.
" The labor market has come into better balance, with continued strong job gains and a low unemployment rate."
 Inflation has eased substantially from a p eak of 7 percent to 2.7 percent but is still too high.
 We are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2  percent goal in support of a strong economy that benefits everyone.
" Today, the FOMC decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to reduce our securities holdings."
 We are maintaining our restrictive stance of monetary policy in order to keep demand in line with supply and reduce inflationary pressures.
 I ’ll have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments.
 Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace.
" Although GDP growth moderated from 3.4 percent in the fourth quarter of last year to 1.3 percent in the first quarter, private domestic final purchases —which excludes inventory investment, government spending, and net exports and usually sends a clearer signal on underlying demand—grew at 2.8 percent in the first quarter, nearly as strong as the second half of 2023."
 Growth of consumer spending has slowed from last ye ar’s robust pace but remains solid.
 Improving supply conditions have supported resilient demand and the strong performance of the U.S. economy over the past year.
" In our Summary of Economic Projections, Committee participants generally expect GDP growth to slow from last year’ s pace, with a median projection of 2.1 percent this year and 2.0 percent over the next two years."
"June 12, 2024   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 2 of 27   In the labor market, supply and demand conditions have come into better balance."
 The unemployment rate ticked up but remains low  at 4 percent.
" Nominal wage growth has eased over the past year , and the jobs -toworkers gap has narrowed."
 The median unemployment rate projection in the SEP is 4.0 percent at the end of this year and 4.2 percent at the end of next year.
 Inflation has eased notably over the past two years but remains above our longer -run goal of 2 percent.
" The inflation data received earlier this year were higher than expected, though more recent monthly readings have eased somewhat."
" Longer -term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households and businesses and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets."
" The median projection in the SEP for total PCE inflation is 2.6  percent this year, 2.3 percent next year, and 2.0 percent in 2026."
"My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship , as it erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials June 12, 2024   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 3 of 27   like food, housing, and transportation."
 Our monetary policy actions are guided by our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.
" As labor market tightness has eased and inflation has declined over the past year, the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals ha ve moved toward better balance."
" The economic outlook is uncertain, however, and we remain highly attentive to inflation risks."
 We’ve stated that we do not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range for the federal funds rate until we have gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent.
" The most recent inflation readings have been more favorable than earlier in the year, however, and there has been modest further progress toward our inflation objective."
 We will need to see more good data to bolster our confidence t hat inflation is moving sustainably toward 2  percent.
 We know that reducing policy restraint too soon or too much could result in a reversal of the progress that we ’ve seen on inflation.
" At the same time, reducing policy restraint too late or too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment."
" As the economy evolves, assessments of the appropriate policy, policy path will adjust in order to best promote our maximum -employment and price -stability goals."
" If the economy remains solid and inflation persists, we ’re prepared to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate as long as appropriate."
" If the labor market were to weaken unexpectedly or if inflation were to fall more quickly than anticipated, we’re prepared to respond."
 The Fed has been assigned two goals for monetary policy— maximum employment and stable prices.
 We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keeping longer -term inflation expectations well anchored.
 Restoring price stabi lity is essential to achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the long run.
 We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum -employment and price -stability goals.
 Just wondering if you could walk me through the Committee ’s average inflation forecast —core PCE is now forecast to be 2.8 percent by the year -end.
" Does that tell June 12, 2024   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 5 of 27   you that the average official expects no further progress in inflation a nd, in fact, that it ’s going to get worse?"
" I mean, I think we’ve, we’ve—what we said is that we don’t think it’ ll be appropriate to , to reduce rates and begin to loosen policy until we have more confidence that inflation is moving back down to 2 percent on a —on a  sustainable basis."
 Would two or three more inflation readings like the one that we saw this morning make a September interest rate cut possible?
" Certainly, more good inflation readings will help with that."
" I ’m not going to be specific about how many because, you know, really, it ’s going to be not just the inflation rating —readings —it’s going to be the totality of the data :  what ’s happening in the labor market, what ’s happening with the balance of risks, what ’s happening with the forecast, what ’s happening with growth."
" Have we reached an appropriate level of confi dence that inflation is moving down sustainably to  2 percent , or, alternatively, do we see really unexpected signs of weakness in the labor market that would call for a response ?”—which is—which is another thing that could, could happen."
" And if I could quickly follow up—did , did you or any of your colleagues change your interest rate projections after 8:30 or whenever you got the inflation numbers today?"
 We’ll know more about the PCE [inflation] readi ng as the month goes on.
" But the initial CPI reading and its, you know, kind of first -level translation to , to PCE  [inflation] we did have this morning."
" So do you think that there still needs to be more cooling in the labor market to bring inflation all the way down to 2 percent , or is there any sense that maybe the labor market is more vulnerable now to higher rates now that many of those imbalances have eased?"
 And we ’ve seen it gradually move back into much better balance between supply and demand.
"  In terms of on the demand side, you know, we ’ve seen —well, we’ve seen quits moving down."
" We have seen unemployment creep up now sixthtenths over the course of , of a year or so very, very gradually."
" So you put all that together —what you have is still -low unemployment, still 4 percent unemployment —historically low."
 The big thing that changed was the inflation forecast.
 So  the inflation forecast moved up several tenths for the end of the year.
" We had really , really  good inflation data in the second half of last year, then kind of a pause in progress in the first quarter."
" You know,  we’re, we’re —the economy has, you know, repeatedly surprised forecasters in both directions, and today was certainly a better inflation report than almost anybody expected."
" In the S ummary of E conomic P rojections, the longrun interest rate forecast moved up a bit."
" And what it is is the , the interest rate that would hold the economy at equilibrium— maximum employment and price stability —potentially, potentially  years in the future where there are no shocks."
" Just to—just to carry that a little further, should we read this as a conclusion that the combination of tipping to one cut this year and acknowledging further progress on inflation as kind of a mark to market on the level of restrictiveness that you need—that you, in fact, have concluded that you weren ’t quite there yet?"
" I , I think this is about, you know, looking at the incoming data and asking, “H ow much progress are we making on inflation, and how is the rest of the economy doing?"
" You know, you can—you can translate it into the —into the language you’re talking about , but, to me, the focus is more on, we have a goal, which is price stability, and an other goal, which is maximum employment."
" You ’ve got growth that stays above longrun potential throughout the forecast period, unemployment that never goes above the longrun estimate —right ?—of 4.2.  So this isn’ t a story of slack improving inflation."
  So where ’s the improvement in inflation coming from that it’ s going to pick up pace so much in 2025?
" You know, clearly a lot of what —some of what we’ ve been getting is just the reversal of the —the unwinding of the pandemic -related distortions to both supply and demand."
" And that is, you know —that is complemented by and amplified —supported by restrictive monetary policy."
" So  you’ ve had, you know, above -trend potential growth and , and high growth."
" And yet you’ ve had the benefit of , of inflation coming down, you know, really fast, actually, last year, and you will see what the rest of this year brinks —brings."
" I mean, ultimately, the question is , ultimately, are you down to demand?"
" But in the meantime, we ’ve made pretty good progress on inflation with our current stance."
" The base case of the Committee seems to be that there is going to be at least one rate cut this year, but your growth forecast doesn’ t see any slowdown in the rest of the year , nor does the unemployment forecast see any significant weakening of the labor market."
 And your inflation forecasts basically average out to no change.
" That ’s what we ’ve been getting is good progress on inflation, with growth at a—at a, a good level  and with a strong labor market."
" We kind of see what we wanted to see, which was gradual cooling in demand —gradual rebalancing in the June 12, 2024   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 15 of 27   labor market while we ’re continuing to make progress on inflation."
" I mean, ultimately, the best thing we can do for the housing market is to bring inflation down so that we can bring rates down so that the housing market can continue to normalize."
" I was wondering if we can read—on inflation, if you can tell us a little more about where you see inflationary pressure in the economy."
" You mentioned labor markets coming into better balance, and inflation expectations appear to be well anchored."
" So people may still be unhappy about prices  at the grocery store, but June 12, 2024   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 16 of 27   it doesn ’t seem like there ’s a lot of inflationary pressure left in this economy —and wonder if you could tell us more about that."
" So  I, I think it ’s true that housing—that inflationary pressures have come down."
 But we still have—we ’re still getting high inflation readings.
  You see elevated inflation still—and that ’s probably to do with—it could be to do with wages.
" That ’s, that’s, you know, catchup inflation from earlier pressures."
 Inflationary pressures have come down.
" Wages are still running, you know, I would say, above a , a sustainable path, which would be that of trend inflation and trend productivity."
" We, we haven ’t thought of wages as being the principal , you know, cause of inflation."
" But at the same time, getting back to 2 percent inflation is likely to require a return to a more sustainable level, which is somewhat below the current level of increases in the aggregate."
" You know, we always want to avoid the tendency to dismiss the parts of inflation that we —that we don ’t like and just make it go away."
" So —but we had a quarter where inflation was running higher , and, yes, I could stand here and say, “I t’s stuff we shouldn’ t have taken signal from.”   But it is what it is ."
" You know, you, you have to —you know, low inflation is low inflation ."
" High—so i f you have a quarter where it ’s higher —we tried not to take signal from the first couple of months, but we got a third month, and we said, “Okay, the signal we ’re taking is that, you know, we think it ’s going to take longer to get confidence  that June 12, 2024   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 18 of 27   inflation is moving sustainably down to 2 percent.”  That ’s, that’s what we said."
" Now we have today ’s inflation reading, which is very different —very much more positive."
" We’ re looking for something that gives us confidence that inflation is , is moving sustainably down to 2 percent."
 W e’ve got a very strong labor market with unemployment at 4 percent.
" It ’s been a long time sinc e we’ve had, you know, a long stretch of time with unemployment at or below 4 percent— very long time."
 We had a period of high inflation.
"  We—inflation has come down really significantly, and we ’re doing everything we can to—you know, to bring that inflationary episode fully to a halt and fully restore price stability."
" And in the meantime, you know, it ’s going to be painful for, for people , but the ultimate pain would be a, a period of  long, high—a long period of high June 12, 2024   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 19 of 27   inflation."
"  It is people who—lower -income people —people who are at the margins of the economy who, who have the worst experience— who experience the most pain from inflation."
" So, you know, it ’s for those people —for all Americans , but particularly for those people —that we’re doing everything we can to bring inflation back down under control."
 As just a quick follow -up here —you’ ve indicated one interest rate cut sometime this year.
" But what we said is that we , we want to make sure that we ’re confident that inflation is actually moving back down to 2 percent."
" So having that kind of confidence that inflation will be at 2 percent  just—it just pays benefits to the whole economy, to all Americans, for a long period of time."
" We very much want to get back to a place where people can , can  not think about inflation—i t’s just not a concern in the everyday economic decisions that they make."
  I’m just drawing on the change in the statement on there being “modest further progress ” on inflation.
" And just in terms of the June 12, 2024   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 20 of 27   conservatism, how much of that is about stickiness and shelter inflation in particular?"
" So, encouraging has been that growth— you know, the growth, clearly , that we had last year, particularly the second half of last year, and we continue to see stillstrong growth —solid growth this year."
" If you go back a year, there was a real concern about, you know, very much slowing growth and, and a recession —many forecasters had that."
" I would say that the , the—today’ s inflation report is encouraging, but it comes after, you know, several reports that were not so encouraging."
You asked about —your second question was really about shelter inflation.
" It ’s one of the very hardest things in, in inflation and in prices is how to think about, you know, the services that someone is getting by living in a home that they could rent, but they ’re actually living in it."
 But that ’s not our —that’s not how we do inflation here.
" So, overall, the economy is exhibiting solid growth, and, you know —something around 2 percent —which is —which is, you know, good—a good pace of growth for the U.S. economy."
" And, and, you know, the best thing we can do is , is to foster a very strong jobs economy, which we think we have done —ultimately to get inflation under control , because those people experience inflation, you know, very directly —very painfully."
" And, and, you know, once , once  we get inflation under control, rates can come down—which , which will also improve things."
  Is it more the level of the unemployment rate if it were to start to go above 4.2 or something like that?
 How are you thinking about what you’ re looking for to see the job market unexpectedly weaken?
" May I ask —you mentioned, with the slightly higher PCE  [inflation] readings earlier this year , that it wasn ’t one or two months but three months that tipped you to be a bit more cautious in the rate outlook."
" Should we take from that  that—you know, it looks like May will be quite good for PC E [inflation ], as it was for CPI —does that imply that kind of two more good June 12, 2024   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 24 of 27   months would reinstill the confidence that rate cuts could be coming sooner than you currently project?"
" It’s going to be the totality of the data —[including] l abor market data , the growth data ."
" In terms of inflation, you know, you’ d, you’d want to see real progress that builds your confidence that we’re —that we are on a path down to 2 percent."
  I would like to know about the impact of a stronger dollar on U.S. economic growth and prices.
" And I have no doubt that markets should determine the exchange rate, but in —Japan and some emerging market s are suffering from  the strong d ollar."
" You know —and for , for our economy, what , you know, we ’re trying June 12, 2024   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 25 of 27   to foster is maximum employment and price stability."
 You said you would cut rates before inflation falls to 2 percent.
 You ’re forecasting inflation to end the year at 2.8 percent on core PCE .
" Right now, you said the inflation forecast is conservative and that if you got to 2.6 to 2.7 [percent] on PCE  [inflation], that would be  a good place to be."
 You also indicated the job market has mostly normalized.
 So  why not cut rates this summer j ust once —you’ re well above neutral —to try to preserve the soft landing rather than risking waiting too long in  the quest for confidence for inflation?
" We, we understand that if we wait too long, that could come at the cost of economic activity, of employment, of the expansion."
" And what we sa id is that we’ll —that we’re —we don’ t think it ’ll be appropriate to , to begin to loosen policy until we ’re more confident that inflation is moving down to 2 percent over time on a sustainable basis."
 W e’ve got growth—all forecasts are very commonly around 2 percent.
" That ’s a— that’s a  strong growth rate for our June 12, 2024   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 26 of 27   economy."
 Unemployment  is still low.
" We’ ve got an overall test, which is greater confidence that inflation is moving down to 2 percent on a sustainable basis."
" We, we  target aggregate prices and overall employment, so— NANCY MARSHALL -GENZER."
" I think you’ d look at the over —we ’d be looking at the aggregate numbers and, and asking ourselves, “What ’s going on here with inflation in the —at the aggregate level?"
"”  And, you know —and, of course, if, if—any price that contributed to ongoing inflation would , would matter ."
" Any price that contributed to ongoing disinflation would matter , too, but I wouldn’ t single out housing as having a , a special role there."
