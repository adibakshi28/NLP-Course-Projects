"  Over the past year the economy ha s been growing at a strong pac e, the unemployment rate has been near record lows , and inflation has been low and stable."
The economy ha s been adding jobs at a pace t hat will continue bringing the unemployment rate down over time.
 Inflation has remained low and stable and is ending the year a bit more subdued than most had expected.
"Despite this robust economic  backdrop and our expectation for h ealthy growth, we have seen developments that may signa l some softening relative to wh at we were expecting a few months ago."
"Growth in other econo mies around the world has mod erated somewhat over the course of 2018, albeit to stillsolid  levels."
" At the same time , financial market volatility has increased over the past couple of  months, and overall financial  conditions have tightened—that is, they have become le ss supportive of growth."
" Most FOMC participants have, instead, m odestly lowered their growth and inflation forecasts for next Page 1 of 22     December 19, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference FINAL year."
"The projections of Committ ee participants released today  show growth continuing at healthy levels, the unemployment rate falling a bit further next year, and infla tion remaining near 2 percent."
Three years ago the Committee cam e to the view that the best wa y to achieve our mandate was to gradually move interest rates back to levels tha t are more normal in a healthy economy.
 We have brought that down a bit and now think it is more likely that the economy wil l grow in a way that will call for two interest rate increases  over the course of next year.
" Last December, the unemployment rate was 4 .1 percent, and inflation had been running just below 2 percen t."
" This growth wa s predicted to push the Page 2 of 22       December 19, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference FINAL unemployment rate down to near his toric lows, and the increasingly tight labor market was expected to help push i nflation up to 2 percent."
"Given this outlook, Committee members judged that the appropria te way to sustain the expansion with inflation near 2 pe rcent was to continue gradually withdrawing the extraordinary support for the economy that had been in place for almost 10 years."
" Thus, in December 2017, the median of the projections of  FOMC participants pointed to t hree ¼ point interest rate increases in 2018, which would have left the target range for the federal funds rate at yearend at 2 to 2¼ percent, still below most e stimates of the longerrun n ormal rate."
"In early 2018, we saw a rising trajectory for growth; today, instead, we see growth moderating ahead."
"FOMC participants, along with many other forecasters, had long predicted some moderation of growth in 2019."
 T he additional tightening o f financial conditions we have seen over the past couple of mont hs along with signs of somewha t weaker growth abroad have also led us to mark down growth a nd inflation projections a bit.
 The median of FOMC participants’ projections show s growth of 3 percent this year a nd 2.3 percent in 2019.
" With growth remaining next year above its longerrun normal value, the unemployment rate is projected to fall a bit furt her, to 3.5 percent by the end of 2 019."
 Inflation in the median projection remains near 2 percent.
" And , given our four rate increases and the ongoing reduction in our portfolio, monetary policy will be providing a smaller boost to the economy in 2019."
" We will adjust monetary policy as best we can t o keep the expansion on track, the labor market strong, and inf lation near 2 percent."
 One of the recent surprises has been fairly tepid inflation data.
" I w onder, first of all, if you could explain why you think, despite the extremely tight labor market, we’re still not seeing much in the way of inflationary pressu res."
" And in the context of a more datad ependent Fed, how will the Fed respond to further undershoots of  inflation moving into next year?"
" Inflation has come in just a touch below where we expected it to be—not by a big amount, but by a small amount."
" And during that period we’ve had low unemployment and strong growth, and inflat ion has still remained just a Page 5 of 22      December 19, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference FINAL touch below 2 percent."
" Today, the Fed lowered its expectations for interest rate increases."
"So we thought carefully about this, on how t o normalize policy, and came to the view that we would effectively have the balance sheet runoff on  automatic pilot and use monetary policy, rate policy, t o adjust to incoming data."
" And I do think that we will continue to use monetary policy, which is to say rate p olicy, as the active tool of monetary policy."
 Or does the current environment of restrained inflation maybe allow you to space out your next few  moves and take more time to get there?
 We’re forecas ting that growth will be strong enough that unemployment will drop  still further and inflation will remain right near our target.
"Tha t’s why the forecast for gro wth and inflation went down a little Page 7 of 22      December 19, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference FINAL bit."
"On your third factor, you know, political considerations have played no role whatsoever in our discussions or decisions about monetary policy."
 You’re about to undershoot your inflation target for the seventh straight year.
" If so, can you help us to understand why peo ple would be advocating restrictive monetary policy at a time of persistent inflation u ndershoots?"
"Inflation is symmetric around 2 percent, and that ’s how we’re going to look at it."
" The only way to achieve inflation symmetricall y around 2 percent is to have inflation symmetrically around 2 percent, and we’ve been close t o that but we haven’t gotten t here yet, and we have not declared victory on that."
 You’ve had growth well above trend.
 You’ve got inflation moving up to 2 percent.
" We may be in a worl d where interest rates are jus t lower for the time being, and, therefore, we’ll have less policy space to react to economic do wnturns."
"We’re not looking at law change s at all, and we’re not looking at changing t he inflation target, for example."
" We are look ing for better ways to achieve  the inflation goal—for example, on a symmetric basis."
" And if you just run the quantitative easing models in reverse, you would get a pretty small adjustment in economic growth and real outcomes."
" We know the President said, you know, don’t raise interest rates."
"That  forecast involves growth, you k now, between 2 and 2½ percent."
 It involves growth at a strong enough level to continue driving un employment down and inflation near 2 percent.
"As I mentioned, once you—once you’re, broadly speaking, in the range of neutral, I think it’s appropriate to be putting asi de individual estimates of that and be looking at what the incoming data are telling you about the outlook, updating your estimates of what neutral might be, of what the natural rate of unemployment might be, of the state of the economy, so—and letting that lead you to adjust  your outlook and, therefore, yo ur appropriate path for policy."
"So—and, you know, what—what you’re  picking up now, I think, is,  there’s, you know, a mood of concern, or it’s a mood of angst about growth going for ward, if I could just capture it in one thought."
"There are many reasons  that are given for that, b ut, generally speaking, it’s—it’s a concern about, is growth going to be  as strong as it was?"
" It has—what’s happened over, rea lly, 50 years is that inflation has become much less reactive to changes in growth."
"There was a  time when inflation reacted rea lly quickly to changes in growth and changes in unemployment, and that time is behind us."
" And t hat is often attributed to the success of central banks in anchorin g inflation expectations so  that people believe that inflation will come back to the target or a round the target so it doesn’t  go down as much—inflation doesn’t go down as much in a  downturn and doesn’t go up as much  when the—you know, when the economy is strong."
"It’s really true, though, that infl ation has not reacted a lot on a road from 10 percent unemployment to now 3.7 percent unemployment."
" But in terms of just targeting growth, you know , I think—I actually think ou r dual mandate works very well, which is maximum employment and s table prices."
"  You mentioned broadbas ed wage gains this year, and I’m wondering if you see further acceleration in wage  growth and just how much slack there is in the labor market."
" Now they are all at 3, and they’ve just con tinued to gradually move up—not p erfectly in sync, but—and that’s a number that is, you know, right  in keeping with 2 percent inf lation and 1 percent productivity growth."
 Wage—wage increases do no t need to be inflationary.
" There’s plenty of evidence of situations—for example, in the very tight labor market of the late 1990s of a—I think I mentioned in a speech a month or so ago, w e had wage increases above productivity plus inflation, and w e didn’t have high inflation."
"So I woul d expect that wages will keep  moving up, and it doesn’t necessarily mean inflation."
" Is it a worrisome sign for you in terms of the outlook for  growth, for inflation?"
" As I Page 20 of 22      December 19, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference FINAL mentioned, our forecast for next year is—I think, in keeping with most other forecasts—is that we’ll still have solid growth ne xt year, declining unemployment , and a healthy economy."
 You said in October in an interview with P BS that interest rates were a long way from neutral.
 A month later you said interest rates we re just below neutral.
"More broadly, I’m referring to global growth."
"  So, if you go back a year, 2017 was a year of  kind of ongoing upside surprise s in global growth."
 It was the year of synchronized global growth.
" And people raised their fo recasts for growth around the world kind of throughout 2017 and, in some sense, expected that  to continue into 2018."
" So you have still healthy levels of growth in the aggregate around the  world but close to the potential growth rate of, you know, the Page 21 of 22      December 19, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference FINAL global economy."
 But you no longer ha ve the really strong level s of growth you had in 2017.
