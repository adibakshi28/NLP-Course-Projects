" In doing so, my colleagues and I are recognizing the considerable progress the economy has made toward our dual objectives of maximum employment and price stability."
" Over the past year, 2 ¼ million net new jobs have been created, unemployment has fallen fu rther, and inflation has moved closer to our longer -run goal of 2 percent."
" We expect the economy will continue to perform well, with the job market strengthening further and inflation rising to 2 percent over the next couple of years."
" I ’ll have more to s ay about monetary policy shortly, but first I ’ll review recent economic developments and the outlook."
Economic growth has picked up since the middle of the year.
" The unemployment rate fell to 4.6 percent in November, the lowest level since 2007, prior to the recession."
"Turning to inflation, the 12month change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures was nearly 1 ½ percent in October, still short of our 2 percent objective but up more than a percentage point from a year earlier."
 Core inflation—which excludes energy and food prices that tend to be more volatile than other prices —has risen to 1¾ percent.
" As the transitory influences of earlier declines in energy prices and prices of imports continue to fade and as the job market strengthens further, we  expect overall inflation to rise to 2 percent over the next couple of years."
Our inflation outlook rests importantly on our judgment that longer -run inflation expectations remain reasonably well anchored.
 Market -based measures of inflation compensation have moved up considerably but are still low.
" Survey -based measures of longer -run inflation expectations are, on balance, little changed."
" Of course, we remain committed to our 2 percent inflation objective and will continue to carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward this goal."
" As always, they conditioned their projections on their own individual views of appropriate monetary policy , which, in turn, depend on each participant ’s assessment of the multitude of factors that shape the outlook."
" The median projection for growth of inflationadjusted gross domestic product rises from 1.9 percent this year to 2.1 percent in 2017 and stays close to 2 percent in 2018 and 2019, slightly above its estimated longer -run rate."
 The median projection for the unemployment rate stands at 4.7 percent in the fourth quarter of this year.
" Over the next three years, the median unemployment rate runs at 4.5 pe rcent, modestly below the  December 14, 2016  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  Page 3 of 20   median estimate of its longer -run normal rate."
" Finally, the median inflation projection is 1.5 percent this year and rises to 1.9 percent next year and 2 percent in 2018 and 2019."
" Overall, these economic projections are very sim ilar to those made in September:  GDP growth is a touch stronger ; the unemployment rate is a shade lower ; and inflation, beyond this year, is unchanged."
" Returning to monetary policy, the Committee judged that a modest increase in the federal funds rate is appropriate in l ight of the solid progress we have  seen toward our goals of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation."
" That ’s based on our view that the neutral nominal federal funds rate —that is, the interest rate that is neither expansionary nor contractionary and keeps the economy operating on an even keel —is currently quite low by hist orical standards."
 This view is co nsistent with participants ’ projections of appropriate monetary policy.
" Moreover, changes in fiscal policy are only one of the many factors that can influence the outlook and the appropriate course of monetary policy."
" In making our policy decisions, we will continue —as always —to assess economic conditions relative to our objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation."
" The unemployment rate is perhaps a touch, as I said, a touch lower than previously ; you’ve seen some modest downward revisions in that —in that  projection."
" For this year, there was a slight u pward revision to inflation, and some of the participants , but not all of the participants , did incorporate some assumption of a change in fiscal policy into their projections."
" So the statement that I made , that  it would be useful to increase the productive capacity of the economy , reflects my concern that productivity growth has been very low."
" Policies that would improve productivity growth would include policy changes that enhance education, training, workforce development ; policies that spur either private or public investment to enhance the quality of capital in the United States that workers have to work with;  and policie s that spur innovation or competition or the formation of new firms."
"I—you know, it ’s some thing I really just can ’t generalize about because, w hile it would be desirable to have tax policies that do increase the productive capacity  December 14, 2016  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  Page 6 of 20   of the economy , an increase in the pace of productivity change is one of the factors  that does affect the economy ’s neutral rate."
" As we have been saying , we estimate that the value of the neu tral federal funds rate is quite  low—has —and one of the reasons for that is s low productivity growth."
" It could boost very slightly some short -term interest rates that could have an effect on borrowing costs that are linked to them, but , overall, I think that households and firms will see very  modest changes from this decision."
"economy to be strong , that we ’re making progress toward our inflation and unemployme nt goals."
" But even if you discount or don’ t know what the fiscal outlook is going to be next year, unemployment is already below the longer -run projection  December 14, 2016  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  Page 7 of 20   under the policy rule you cited in your August speech."
 Remember that inflation is still below our objective.
 The C ommittee projects —at least the median projection shows a very modest undershoot of estimates  of the longer -run normal rate of unemployment.
" The median unemployment rate here gets down to 4½ percent, which is just a few tenths below the estimated longer -run normal level of the unemployment rate."
 And we think that that ’s appropriate because we want inflation to rise to our 2 percent  objective in a timely fashion.
 So there is not a substantial undershoot of the natural rate of unemployment.
" We ’re not seeing evidence in labor markets of very substantial upward pressures on labor that could signify extreme shortages of labor that could propel inflation higher in a very rapid way, and inflation is still operating below our objective."
" I’m curious, you and your predecessor had both at times c alled for more fiscal stimulus to help with the outlook, the growth outlook."
" Well, I believe my predecessor and I called for fiscal stimulus when the unemployment rate was substantially higher  than it is now."
" So, with a 4.6 percent  unemployment and a solid labor ma rket, there may be some additional slack in labor markets , but I would judge that the degree of slack has diminished."
 So I would say at this point that fiscal policy is not obviously needed to provide stimulus to help us get back to full employment.
" I’ve continued to highlight the importance of spurring productivity growth, that I think that would be something that ’s beneficial for the economy."
" Chair Yellen, you’ve just spoken about some of the risks —the inflationary risks of running in this expansionary fiscal policy."
" The under —unemployment rate is projected to modestly undershoot , for several years, levels that are deemed to be normal in the longer r un."
 T hat’s an appropriate policy  purely on the grounds that inflation is running below our objective.
" We have been given the independence by Congress to make decisions about monetary policy in pursuit of our dual -mandate objectives of maximum employment and inflation , and that is what I intend to stay focused on."
" The election of Donald Trump seem ed to have sparked a major reaction in financial markets :  stock prices at record highs, the dollar has strengthened, long -term interest rates are higher."
" And in so far as that  will affect monetary policy, of course we will have to factor those policies along with many other things, including the global environment and oil prices and other matters."
" The changes —the financial market changes that you described, particularly the increase in stock prices, the increase in longer -term rates , and the strengthening of the dollar , suggest that many market participants anticipate expansionary fiscal policies that would raise interest rate s somewhat in the United States relative to abroad and would cause a  strengthening in the dollar."
 My colleagues write down their best estimates of a normal longer -run unemployment rate.
" The median stands at 4.8 percent, so we ’re close, possibly —the unemployment rate right now is ever so slightly below , but in the nei ghborhood."
" If we look at la rger, broader mea sures of slack , like the U -6 measure that includes involuntary part -time employment and those who are marginally attached to the labor force, t hey’re slightly higher than pre -recession levels, but they ’ve come down considerably."
 The labor market was in the vicinity of maximum employment.
" They may have been boosted by expectations about tax policy ; possible cuts in corporate tax rates that have been much discussed ; or by expectations about growth, possible reductions , and downside risk to the economy."
" But, you know, these are things tha t market participants are trying to view , along with the likely path of —paths of interest rates, and I think all of that factors into movements and stock valuations."
" Well, I think rates of return in the stock market relative to —remember that the level of interest rates is low , and , taking that into account, I believe it’ s fair to say that they remain within normal ranges."
" One of the things we ’ve learned from our financial crisis and from a series of financial crises in history and around the globe is that , very commonly, when the economy takes a hit and falls into a recession, that productivity doesn’ t pick up to pre -recession levels and that there looks like there is a permanent hit to the path of potential output for the economy , which is called “ hysteresis."
" And , as I indicated, I think the path that you see —that the Committee has laid out in a tentative way that involves a modest degree of undershooting of normal longer -run levels of unemployment going down to around 4½ percent would remain for a couple of years —might provide some insight."
 I think anyone looking at incoming data can clearly see that we have enjoyed further progress both in the labor market and on inflation.
" I’m wondering, what do you think are two or three concrete steps that could be taken to increase manufacturing employment in the United  States?"
 We’ve had some recovery in manufacturing employment as the econom y’s recovered.
" So, to some extent, manufacturing employment  December 14, 2016  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  Page 18 of 20   depends on the progress of the economy, and we have seen some recovery."
" Over a long period  of time, technological change  is something that has been important in reducing manufacturing employment absolutely and as  a share of jobs in the economy."
" We want to feel that if the economy w ere to suffer an adverse shock, that we have some scope through traditional means of interest rate cuts to be able to respond to that."
"Now, the y’re ones that the Fed is  not well  positioned— I think our policies can affect the general level of economic activity and slack in the labor market, the level —the rate of inflation , which we focus on."
" For example, the African  American unemployment rate at this point is no w rough— about back to 2007 levels as well."
