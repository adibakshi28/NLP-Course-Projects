" Unfortunately, however, unemployment remains high."
" About 5 million people —more than 40 percent of the unemployed—have been with out a job for six months or more, and millions more who say they would like full -time work have been able to find only part -time employment or have stopped looking entirely."
 The conditions now prevailing in the job market represent an enormous waste of human and economic potential.
" A return to broadbased prosperity will require sustained improvement in the job market, which in turn requires stronger economic growth."
" Meanwhile, apart from some temporary fluctuations that largely reflected swings in energ y prices, inflation has remained tame and appears  likely to run at or below the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC ’s) 2 percent objective in coming quarters and over the longer term."
" Against a macroeconomic backdrop that includes both high unemployment and subdued inflation, the FOMC will maintain its highly accommodative policy."
"  In continuing its asset purchases, the Committee seeks to maintain downward pressure on longer -term interest rates and to keep financial conditions accommodative, thereby promoting hiring and economic growth while ensuring that inflation December 12, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL    2 of 34  over time is clo se to our 2 percent objective."
" In assessing the extent of progress, the Committee will be evaluating a range of labor market indicators, including the unemployment rate, payroll employment, hours worked, and labor force participation, among others."
" Because increases in demand and production are normally precursors to improvements in labor market conditions, we will also be looking carefully at the pace of economic activity more broadly."
" Specifically, the Committee anticipates that exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate are likely to be warranted “at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6½ percent, inflation over the period between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than half a percentage point above the Committee’s 2 percent longer -run goal, a nd longer -term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored.”   This formulation is a change from earlier statements in which forward guidance about the federal funds rate was expressed in terms of a date; for example, in the statements following its  September and October meetings,  the Committee indicated that it anticipated that exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate are likely to be warranted “ at least through mid -2015.”  The  modified  formulation  makes more explicit  the FOMC’s intention  to maintain accommodation as  long as  needed to promote a stronger economic recovery in the context of price stability, a strategy that we believe will help support December 12, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL    4 of 34  household and business confidence and spending."
" By tying future monetary policy more expli citly to economic conditions, this formulation of our policy guidance should also make monetary policy more transparent and predictable to the public."
" In particular, the Committee expects that the stated threshold for unemployment will not be reached before mid2015 and projects that inflation will re main close to 2 percent over that period."
" Thus, given the Committee’s current outlook, the guidance introduced today is consistent with the Committee’s earlier statements that “exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate are likely to be warranted  at least through mid -2015.”    Let me emphasize that the 6 ½ percent threshold for the unemployment rate should not be interpreted as the Committee’s longer -term objective for unemployment."
" Indeed, in the economic projections submitted in conjunction with today’s meeting, the central tendency of participants’ est imates of the longer -run normal rate of unemployment is 5.2 to 6.0 percent."
" However, because changes in monetary policy affect the economy with a lag, the Committee believes that it likely will need to begin moving away from a highly accommodative policy stance before the economy reaches maximum employment."
 Waiting until maximum employment is achieved before beginning the process of removing policy accommodation could lead to an undesirable overshooting of potential output and compromise the FOMC’s longer -term inflation objective of 2 percent.
" As the FOMC statement makes clear, the Committee anticipates that policy under the new guidance will be fully consistent with continued progress against unemployment and with inflation remaining close to the Committee’s 2 percent objective over the longer term."
" December 12, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL    5 of 34  Although the modified guidance should provide greater clarity about how the Committee expects to respond to incoming data, it by no means puts monetary policy on autopilot."
" For example, if unemployment were to decline to slightly below 6½ percent at a time when inflation and inflation expectations were subdued and were projected to remain so, the Committee might judge an immediate increase in its  target for the federal funds rate to be inappropriate."
" Ultimately , in deciding when and how quickly to reduce policy accommodation, the Committee will follow a balanced approach in seeking to mitigate deviations of inflation from its longer -run 2 percent  goal and deviations of employment from its estimated maximum level."
"   Second, the Committee recognizes that no single indicator provides a complete assessment of the state of the labor market and therefore will consider changes in the unemployment rate within the broader context of labor market conditions."
" For example, in evaluating a given decline in the unemployment rate, the Committee will also take into account the extent to which that decline was associated with increases in employment and hours worked, as opposed to, say, increases in the number of discouraged workers and falling labor force participation."
 The Committee will also consider whether the improvement in the unemployment rate appears sustainable.
" Third, the Committee chose to express the inflation threshold in terms of projected inflation between one and two years ahead, rather than in terms of current inflation."
" The Committee took this approach to make clear that it intends to look through purely transitory December 12, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL    6 of 34  fluctuations in inflation, suc h as those induced by short -term variations in the prices of internationally traded commodities, and to focus instead on the underlying inflation trend."
" In making its collective judgment about the underlying inflation trend, the Committee will consider a variety of indicators, including measures such as median, trimmed mean, and core inflation; the views of outside forecasters; and the predictions of econometric and statistical models of inflation."
" Also, the Committee will pay close attention to measures of inflation expectations to ensure that those expectations remain well anchored."
" While in that circumstance the Committee would no longer be increasing policy accommodation, its policy stance would remain highly supportive of growth."
" As I have often stressed, December 12, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL    7 of 34  however, monetary policy has its limits; only the private and public sectors working together can get the U.S. economy fully back on track."
" The asset purchases are about creating some near -term momentum in the economy, trying to strengthen growth and job creation in the near term, and the increases in the federal funds rate t arget, when they ultimately occur, are about reducing accommodation."
" We have —we’ll be learning over time about how efficacious they are, about what costs they may carry with them in terms of unintended consequences that they might December 12, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL    8 of 34  create, and we’ll be seeing how —what else happens in the economy that can affect, you know, the level of unemployment, for example, that we hope to achieve."
" And, by taking an unemployment rate that is quite low compar ed to currently, does that shift the balance of priorities in terms of your dual mandate, closer more in the direction of reducing unemployment rather than inflationary pressures?"
" It is not a change in our relative balance, weights, towards inflation and unemployment —by no means."
" First of all, with respect to inflation, we remain completely committed to our 2 percent longer -run objective."
" Moreover, we expect our forecast, as you can see from the Summary of Economic Projections; our forecasts are  that inflation will actually remain, despite this threshold of 2½, that inflation will actually remain at or below 2 percent going forward."
" And so—and finally, the thresholds that we have put out are entirely consistent with our long -standing views on what the rate path has to be, what the path of interest rates has to be, in order to achieve improvement in the labor market while keeping inflation close to target."
" And also, you know, you’ve talked about maintaining the asset purchases unt il you see a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market , and you’ve said that you want to take a qualitative approach, but you’ve also got this 6½ percent inflation threshold out there as well."
" But obviously, as long as the costs and other concerns do not em erge, we’ll be looking for, you know, something that is substantial in terms of a better job market."
" Given the fiscal cliff, is it pos sible that if the country, if the policy makers were not to agree to some sort of deficit deal by the end of this year and we were to go over the fiscal cliff, that the size of these asset purchases could indeed grow in response to that?"
" Well, for the first part of your question if the economy actually went off the fiscal cliff, our assessment, the CBO’s assessment, outside forecasters, all think that that would have very significant adverse effects on the economy and on the unemployment rate."
" The Committee’s assessment of the longer -run unemployment rate is 6 percent, or perhaps a bit lower, and the longer -run equilibrium fed funds rate is around 4 percent according to these projections ."
" It suggests that when the Fed does start raising interest rates down the road, it might have to move fairly quickly to get to some equilibrium fed funds rate."
" So first of all, we don’t have a precise estimate of the long -run sustai nable unemployment rate."
" Of course, that depends on where inflation is and other conditions."
" But it’s —the path that we’r e basing these numbers on is one that assumes, first of all, as you anticipated, assumes a n increase in the funds rate first occurring some time after unemployment goes below 6½ percent, but does not necessarily assume a rapid increase after that."
" But assuming that inflation remains well controlled, w hich I fully anticipate, I think that the rate of increase in rates would be moderate."
" And then, on the monetary policy actions today, can you give us a little bit December 12, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL    15 of 34  more color on how you set the thresholds at wha t they were?"
" On the threshold numbers, this is based—these numbers are based on substantial analysis done by staff , both here and at the Reserve Banks, trying to assess under so -called optimal policy , or in the best policy that we can come up with, what would the interest rate path look like and how would it be connected or correlated with changes in unemployment and inflation."
" And when we do that analy sis, what we find is that the best interest rate path —as best as we can determine it based on our models and analysis, which is obviously imperfect —has rates remaining low until unemployment drops below 6½ percent."
" And it projects if we put in the two—the  half of a percentage point above the 2 percent goal as a kind of protection against any problem with price December 12, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL    16 of 34  stability, but our projections, our actual forecast suggests that inflation will not go there."
" Inflation will stay around 2 percent, which will be consistent with our longer -term objective."
 But it doesn’t necessarily require a change in the thresholds because that date adjustment can be made by markets just simply by looking at their own forecasts of when unemployment will cross the line and the behavior of inflation.
" Are employers going to really cut back on the employment, do you think?"
" I mean certain parts of South Carolina have developed pretty strongly but the part where I come from —mostly agricultural, it has a little bit of manufacturing —has a very high  unemployment rate, a high foreclosure rate, December 12, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL    17 of 34  and people are having a hard time there."
" It’s easy to look at the unemployment rate and say, well it’s one -tenth or two -tenths."
" So it is very important to try to keep in mind the reality of unemployment, of  foreclosure, of weak wage growth, et cetera, so we always try to do that."
" But as many analysts, not just the Fed, have pointed out, if the fiscal cliff was allowed to occur, and certainly if it were sustained for any period, it could have a very negative effect on hiring, jobs, wages, economic activity, investment ."
" In the optimal policy path that Vice Chair Yellen laid out in her speech a few weeks ago, i t showed the first rise in interest rates occurring in early 2016 and then rates rising very slowly after that."
" And secondly, if I may, you referred to a number of inflation forecasts in your introductory  remarks."
" In that case, how will we ever know that the inflation threshold has been hit?"
" I mean, we ’ve run it for a variety of different scenarios, different assumptions about models , and so on, but the general December 12, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL    19 of 34  character of that interest rate path, i.e. , that it stays low until unemployment is in the vicinity of 6½ or a little lower, and then rises relativ ely slowly, which goes back to the question that was asked earlier, that it doesn ’t involve a rapid removal of accommodation after that point is reached."
" You ’ll note also in that kind of policy path, of the type that she discussed , that inflation stays essentially at 2 or very close to 2."
"In terms of inflation forecast, the —what the C ommittee will do on a regular basis is include in its statement its views of where inflation is likely to be a year from now."
" For example, currently, we already say that, you know, we expect inflation to run at or below the Committee’s objective in a long er term."
" The intellectual exercise we’ll be doing is asking ourselves if we maintain low rates along the lines suggested by this policy, would we ex pect inflation to cross the threshold or reach that level?"
" And so for that reason, you know, we will be referring extensively to publicly available information such as various measures of inflation— I mentioned some in my opening remarks —outside forecasts , the breakevens from inflation protected bonds, et cetera."
" Sir, you’ve articulated more clearly than ever your commitment to reduce unemployment, but you’ve also said that you’re not actually doing anything more to achieve that goal —that you still expect it to be three years away, that you’re disappointed with the pace of progress, and that inflation is not the limiting factor."
 Why is the Fed not announcing today additional measures to reduce unemployment?
" And so what we’re trying to do here is balance the potential benefits, in terms of lower December 12, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL    21 of 34  unemployment and inflation at target, against the reality that as the balance sheet gets bigger that there’s greater costs that might be associated with that, and those have to be taken to account."
" But, those are judgments I think that Congress has to make about whether they can simultaneously continue  support ive fiscal  policy in the short term while maintaining the credibility that, in fact, they will be addressing our structural deficit problems in the longer term."
" Looking over the past year or several years, how would you evaluate the Fed’s accuracy making economic forecasts, and how does that affect the ability to make monetary policy decisions, especially as it’s connected to the thresholds?"
" Well, I think it’s fair to say that we have overestimated the pace of growth, total output growth, GDP growth, from the beginning of the recovery and we have  had therefore —had to continue to scale down our estimates of output growth."
" But interestingly, at the same time, we have been more accurate, not perfectly accurate by any means, but we’ve been somewhat more accurate in forecasting unemployment."
" And I think the reconciliation is that what we’re December 12, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL    23 of 34  learning is that, at least temporarily, the financial crisis may have reduced somewhat the underlying potential growth rate of the U.S. economy."
 And that can account for at least part of the somewhat slower growth.
" At the same time, though, what —of course, what monetary policy influences is not potent ial growth, not the underlying structural growth."
" What monetary policy affects, primarily, is the state of the business cycle, the amount of excess unemployment or the extent of recession in the economy."
" That being s aid, of course, we have over time, as we have seen disappointment in growth and job creation, we have obviously, as we did in September, have added accommodation and we’ve continued— we continue to reassess the outlook."
 Economists have long believed that central banks cannot affect the unemployment rate in the long run.
 That ’s one reason you’ ve seen a move towards central banks being given mandates for low inflation only.
" Can you explain if the Fed, by tying its monetary policy so explicitly to a n unemployment threshold, whether that is consistent or inconsistent with that longstanding view?"
" And , if it’ s consistent, how is this superior to simply having a threshold for inflation only ?"
 And would the approach that you ’re now taking be possible if the Fed had only a mandate for low inflation?
" As we stated , in fact , in our January set of principles , the central bank cannot control unemployment in the long run."
" There’ s a little bit of a caveat here, which is that very extended periods of unemployment can interfere with the workings of the labor market."
" And so, if the Fed were not to address a large unemployment problem for a long time, it might, in fact, have some influence on the long -term unemployment rate."
" But as a general rule, as a general rule, and I think this is the right baseline, the long -term unemployment rate is determined by a range of structural features of the economy and a range of economic policies and not by monetary policy."
" It is not a Taylor rule but it has the same feature that it relates policy to observables in the economy, such as unemployment and inflation."
" It has no implication that we can affect the long -run unemployment rate, which we believe is lower than 6½ percent."
" So, I understand your point but I think that it ’s—that providing information on unemployment and inflation gives more information to the markets , to the public that allows them to infer how our policy is likely to evolve."
 Unless —so long as the inflation condition is met.
" If the business December 12, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL    27 of 34  cycle runs out of steam and you’ re still at zero percent interest rates, does the Fed no longer have a forceful response in that situation?"
" But it’ s certainly true , I’ve —you know, there’s no doubt that with interest rates near zero and with the balance sheet already large, that the ability to provide additional accommodation is n ot unlimited and that that’s just a reality and that actually is an argument, I think, for being a little bit more aggressive now."
" So, exactly for those reasons, the kind of risks that arise when the —when policy interest rates are close to zero, and the  greater difficulty in providing additional policy support, I think that’s an argument for being somewhat more proactive now, when we still have the ability to do that, and to try to get the economy, you know, back to a healthy condition."
" In your mind, what is happening in the job market?"
 Wha t is your sense of how quickly it’s fallen because of new employment?
 The debate over the extent to which the unemployment rate is falling  from —   CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
" Well, you know, you can see the comparison by looking, for example, at the household survey, which gives estimates of how many people are added to the labor force, how many are added to the employed, how many people are leaving the labor force, and it’s true that part of the decline in unemployment —and indeed all of it in the last reading, but over the recovery, part of the decline in unemployment has come from declines in participation rates, that is, people leaving the labor force."
" But beyond that downward trend, there’s been some additional decline in labor force participation, and in the ratio of employment to population, which presumably is linked to discouragement about the state of the labor force."
" Wage growth obviously is very weak, and I could go on."
" So, it may be  that the labor market is even a bit weaker than the current unemployment rate suggests, but I think that it is nevertheless the case that there has been improvement since the trough a couple of years ago."
" With the federal government borrowing roughly $1 trillion a year and now with the Fed on pace to buy roughly a trillion dollars a year in bonds, are you concerned about a public , and possibly global , perception that the Fed is accommodating not just growth but accommodating federal borrowing needs, and are you concerned about what this might do to the Fed’ s credibility , and the December 12, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL    32 of 34  credibility of U.S. finances in general, and t he credibility of the dollar as the world’s leading currency?"
" There is not any sign either of current inflation or of any —there’s no strong evidence that there are any increases in inflation expectations for that matter, looking at financial markets, looking at surveys, looking at economic forecasts, and so on."
" We want to be sure that there’s no misunderstanding, that there’s no effect on inflation expectations from the size of our balance sheet."
