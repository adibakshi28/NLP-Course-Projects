" This accommodative policy should support some further strengthening in the job market and a return to 2 percent inflation, consistent with our statutory o bjectives."
"As we expected, and smoothing through some variation from quarter to quarter, economic activity has been rising moderately so far this year."
 Household spending has been supported by ongoing strength in the job market.
" In the third quarter, however, economic growth will be held down by the severe disruptions caused by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria."
" As activity resumes and rebuilding gets under  way, growth likely will bounce back."
"September 20, 2017  Chair Yellen’s  Press Conference  FINAL  Page 2 of 25  In the labor market, job gains averaged 185,000 per month over the three months ending in August —a solid rate of growth that remained well above estimate s of the pace necessary to absorb new entrants to the labor force."
" We know from some timely indicators , such as initial claims for unemployment insurance , that the hurricanes severely disrupted the labor market in the affected areas, and payroll employmen t may be substantially affected in September."
" Meanwhile, the unemployment rate has stayed low in recent months and, at 4.4 percent in August, was modestly below the median of FOMC participants’ estimates of its longer -run normal level."
 W e expect that the job market will strengthen somewhat further.
" Turning to inflation, the 12month change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures was 1.4 percent in July, down noticeably from earlier in the year."
 Core inflation—which excludes the volatile food and energy categories —has also moved lower.
" For quite some time, inflation has been running below the Committee’s 2 percent longer -run obje ctive."
" However, we believe this year’s shortfall in inflation primarily reflects developments that are largely unrelated to broader economic conditions."
" For example, one -off reductions earlier this year in certain categories of prices, such as wireless t elephone services, are currently holding down inflation, but these effects should be transitory."
" Such developments are not uncommon and, as long as inflation expectations remain reasonably well anchored, are not of great concern from a policy perspective because their effects fade away."
" September 20, 2017  Chair Yellen’s  Press Conference  FINAL  Page 3 of 25  Similarly, the recent hurricane -related increases in gasoline prices will likely boost inflation, but only temporarily."
" More broadly, with employment near assessments of its maximum sustainable level and the labor market continuing to strengthen, the Committee continues to expect inflation to move up and stabilize around 2 percent over the next couple of years, in line with our longer -run objective."
" Nonetheless, our understanding of the forces driving inflation is imperf ect, and in light of the unexpected lower inflation readings this year, the Committee is monitoring inflation developments closely."
" As always, the Committee is prepared to adjust monetary policy as needed to achieve its inflation and employment objectives  over the medium term."
" The median projection for growth of inflation -adjusted gross domestic product , or real GDP , is 2.4 percent this year and about 2 percent in 2018 and 2019."
" By 2020, the median growth projection moderates to 1.8 percent, in line with its estimated longer -run rate."
" The median projection for the unemployment rate stands at 4.3 percent in the fourth quarter of this year and runs a little above 4 per cent over the next three years, modestly below the median estimate of its longer -run normal rate."
" Finally, the median inflation projection is 1.6 percent this year, 1.9 percent next year, and 2 percent in 2019 and 2020."
" Compared with the projections made  in June, real GDP growth is a touch stronger this year , and inflation—particularly core inflation —is slightly softer this year and next."
"September 20, 2017  Chair Yellen’s  Press Conference  FINAL  Page 4 of 25  Returning to monetary policy, although the Committee decided at this meeting to maintain its target for the federal funds rate, we continue to expect that the ongoing strength of the economy will warrant gradual increases in that rate to sustain a healthy labor market and stabilize inflation around our 2 percent longer -run objective."
 This view is consistent with participants’ projections of appropriate monetary policy.
" By limiting the volume of securities that private investors will have to absorb as we reduce our holdings, the caps should guard against outs ized moves in interest rates and other potential market strains."
" Finally, as we have noted previously, changing the target range for the federal funds rate is our primary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy."
 Our balance sheet is not intended to be an active tool for monetary policy in normal times.
" Chair Yellen,  there ’s been extraordinary progress during your term as Chair in lowering  several measures of unemployment and underemployment , and all while inflation has remained subdued."
" Bill Spriggs , the chief economist at  the AFL -CIO, who I think you know well, criticized the F ed last week for seeking to maintain unemployment above 4 percent , which he notes necessarily means keeping the unemployment rate among black Americans above 8 percent ."
" He described this as a deliberate policy to sacrifice many h undreds September 20, 2017  Chair Yellen’s  Press Conference  FINAL  Page 6 of 25  of thousands of potential workers and their families out of fear of future inflation, when in fact the Fed ’s preferred measure of inflation has not exceed ed 3 per cent in more than 25 years."
 So I’m wondering how you would respond to his frustration over the Fed ’s desire to continue raising rates when core inflation really shows no sign of heading above the Fed ’s symmetric goal for inflation.
  So let me first say that employment is a very important part of our mandate.
" We ’re charged by Congress with trying to pursue maximum employment, and we have taken that very seriously."
" I’m very pleased and heartened by the i mprovement we have seen in the labor market, and  at 4.4 percent, t he unemployment rate has  really fallen to quite a low level."
" As that ’s happened, the unemployment rates for less advantaged groups in the labor m arket , particularly African  Americans and Hispanics, ha s fallen more dramatically than that for the nation as a whole, reversing the outsized increases that those groups experienced when the financial crisis and G reat R ecession hit."
" So we certainly seek a strong labor m arket, but we have a dual mandate, which is inflation and unemployment , and we also have to be mindful of our obligation to achieve a  2 percent inflation objective over the medium term."
"Now, I recognize and it ’s important that inflation has been running under our 2 percent objective for a number of years , and that is a concern, particularly if it were to translate into lower inflation expectations."
" This year, the September 20, 2017  Chair Yellen’s  Press Conference  FINAL  Page 7 of 25  shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, when none of those factors is operative , is more of a mystery, and I will not say that the C ommittee clearly understands what the causes are of that."
" All of the variables —GDP, t he unemploymen t rate , and inflation —are forecast by ourselves and private forecasters with errors , and so there is variation in these economic variables fro m year to year."
" You can see from the projections that the C ommittee participants submitted that we anticipate that core and headline inflation will move up close to our 2 percent objective next year —namely , that the shortfall this year is du e to transitory factors that are likely to disappear over the course of the coming year ."
But I want to emphasize that we do have a commitment to raising inflation to 2 percent .
" We will look at incoming data on inflation and on other economic variables, including the labor m arket , in deciding what we should actually do going f orward ."
" And if it proves contrary to our expectations that the shortfall is persistent, it will be necessary to adjust monetary policy to address that."
" But I want to point out that while there are risks that inflation could continue below 2 percent, whic h we need to take account of in monetary policy , monetary policy also operates with a  lag."
" And experience suggests that tightness in the labor  market , gradually and with a  lag, tends to push up wage and price inflation, and that ’s also a risk , that we want to be careful not to allow the economy to overheat in a way that would force us later on, somewhere do wn the road, to have to tighten m onetary policy rapidly , which could cause a recession a nd threaten the very desirable labor m arket conditio ns that we have now."
" And have they , in your own mind, helped to counter some of the concerns you’ve had about the inflation s hortfalls that we ’ve been seeing ?"
" So developments affecting asset prices and longer -term interest rates, the exchange rate—all of those aspects of financial conditions factor into our thinking ."
" Sometimes mo vements —upward movements in asset prices can,  for example, reflect a change in market participants ’—reduction in market participants ’ estimates of the longer -run level of interest rates."
" So there has been —there have been downward revisions both to the Committee ’s and to market participants ’ estimates of the longer -run normal level of interest rates , which in turn reflects in some sense a  view that , going out many years , aggregate demand globally is likely to be weakened by continuing low productivity growt h and aging populations ."
" Madam C hair, you just said in your opening remarks that reducing the balance sheet sh ould not be “ an active tool for monetary policy in normal times, ” you don’ t plan to make adjustments to the balance  sheet ."
" I’m wondering if we could explore if there ’s any sensitivity to the plan you just announced if there ’s a spike in interest rates, a plunge i n the stock market, weakness in  growth."
" If there ’s some unexpected development in markets , or, for example, given that we don’ t know what the plans are on the fiscal side for the deficit in terms of tax cuts—there could be a sudden spike in the deficit —will the balance sheet reduction plan be immune to all of that ?"
 So we have two policy tools that are available to us to use:  the balance sheet and adjustments in  short -term interest rates —our  federal funds rate target .
" And, historically , the C ommittee has  operated t o adjust monetary conditions to meet our economic goals when there are shocks to the economy by adjusting  the federal funds r ate—our  short -term interest rate target."
"So, if there are small changes in the outlook t hat require a recalibration of monetary policy, we will change our anticipated path and setting of the federal funds rate, but not , for example, change the caps on reinvestment or stop —continue  reinvestment for a few months and then change it."
 You have described plans to raise interest rates even more gradually than previously.
 You are locked in for a long period of time to a forecast that monetary p olicy will essentiall y keep interest rates at a low level and keep a balance sheet at a high level.
" We believe that economic conditions will evolve in a way that will warrant gradual, further increases in  our federal funds rate target, but if conditions evolve differently than that, whichever direction that might be —it mig ht be that growth is more rapid, t he labor m arket tightens more quickly than we assume, an d inflation appears to be picking up more rapidly than we had expected —we have not promised, no matter what, that the path of interest rate increases will be gradual."
" But, you know, we will adjust monetary policy ."
" W hat’s not subject to change is our commitmen t to doing everything in our power to achieve the goals that Congress has  assigned to u s, which are price stability or 2 percent inflation and maximum employment."
" So , certainly , if growth is stronger or if inflation picks up more rapidly , we have room."
" Chair Yellen , Fed Governor Lael Brainard recently gave a speech in which she said trend inflation appeared to have moved lower by around ½ percentage point."
" And what would the F ed need to do , if anything , to boost trend inflation if it has  fallen?"
" And , related to that, you’ve said you expect the inflation softness this year to prove “ transitory."
"”  Compared to three months ago, how firm is your curr ent expectation that the slowdown will remain transitory , and what implications would that have for monetary policy if it is  not?"
 So the term “ trend inflation ”—usually there are a variety of statistical techniques that can be used to extract a trend from a series.
" After all, we’ve had a numbe r of years in which inflation has  been low."
" As I said in answer to an earlier question, I think if you g o back to, s ay, 2013 and consider the —until this year, the reasons why inflation was low are not hard to understand."
" It’s a combination September 20, 2017  Chair Yellen’s  Press Conference  FINAL  Page 13 of 25  of slack in the labor m arket, declines in energ y prices, and a strong dollar that pulled down import price inflation."
So what ’s important in determining inflation going forward is inflation expectations.
" Market -based measures of inflation c ompensation, as we mentioned in the statement —they have declined, and they’ve been stable in recent months, but they ’ve declined to levels that are low by historical standards."
" That might suggest that inflation expectations have come down, but one can’ t get a clear read —the re are risk premia built into inflation c ompensation that make it impossible to extract directly what inflation expectations are."
 I can ’t say I can easily poin t to a sufficient set of factors that explain this year why inflation has been this  low.
" I’ve mentioned a few idiosyncratic things, but , frankly, the low inflation is more broad based than just idiosyncratic things."
 The fact that inflation is unusually l ow this year does not mean that that ’s going to continue.
" Remember that in January and February, core inflation was running over a 12month basis at around 1.9 percent, and we look to be very close to 2 now."
" We ’ve had several months of data that have meaningfully pulled that down, and what we need to do is  figure out whether or not the factors that have lowered inflation are likely to prove persistent or they ’re likely to prove transitory, and that’s what we ’re going to try to be determining on the basis of incoming data ."
" Of course, if we determined our view changed, and instead of thinking that the factors holding inflation down were transitory , we came to the view that they would be persistent, it would re quire an alteration in monetary policy to move inflation back up to 2 percent, and we would be committed to making that adjustment."
" N ot in the last couple of quart ers, but over the last several years , there’ s been a growing recognition that the so -called neutral interest rate, consistent with the economy operating at maximum employment, that that rate seems to have come down, and most of the economic papers and  research bearing on this topic suggest that it ’s quite low."
" Chair Yellen , a month ago you delivered a speech in Wyoming in which you said, “T he balance of research suggests that the core reforms we have put in place have substantially boosted resilience without unduly limiting credit availability or economic growth."
" And then, regarding economic growth, the accommodative process that the F ed has followed for the last 10 years has helped bri ng us to full employment, but economists point out that there have been people who haven ’t benefited ."
 But I also tried to emphasize —and I believe that they have contributed to growth and the availability of credit.
" We had a 10 percent unemployment rate, and our congressional mandate is maximum employment and price stability."
" So we set monetary policy not with a view tow ard affecting the distribution of income, but toward pursuing those congressionally mandated goals ."
"And I am pleased to see the unemployment rate and every other measure that I know of pertaining to the labor m arket show dramatic improvement over these years, and that is hugely important to the economic wellbeing not at the top end of the  wealth and income distribution, September 20, 2017  Chair Yellen’s  Press Conference  FINAL  Page 18 of 25  but to the bottom end of the income distribution ."
 Do you or any of the C ommittee members have concerns if that package does not end up being deficit neutral and ends up adding to the debt?
" You know, I ’ve put forward  a few principles about fiscal policy that I would reiterate, that one of the problems that the  American economy suffers from, along with many other economies around the globe, is slow productivity growth, and I think it would be very desirable if a fiscal package had the potential in it to create incentives that would raise productivity growth."
" We do face, in terms of longer -term deficits as the population ages, an unsustainable debt path that will require, I beli eve, some adjustments to fiscal p olicy, and I hope Congress will keep that in mind ."
 A recent Fed working paper estimated that the full set of balance s heet actions that we took during the crisis may have lowered long -term interest rates by about 100 basis points.
" I would say that if economists are correct that we’ re living in a world w here the level of neutral interest rates not only in the United States, but around the world is likely to be low in the future September 20, 2017  Chair Yellen’s  Press Conference  FINAL  Page 21 of 25  due to slow productivity growth and demographics —now , we don’ t know that that view will bear out to be correct, but it is a view th at many people adhere to when there is evidence of it —then future policymakers will be faced with the question of, in the event of a severe downturn where they ’re not able to provide as much stimulus as they would ideally like by cutting overnight interest  rates, what other actions are available to them ?"
" And I’m wondering if that bothers you, if you’ re concerned about overstimulating the economy, or if you feel inflation could break out much more quickly than we have seen, or if you feel there’ s a financial stability question because stocks, bonds, and real estate are all so expensive now."
" Every measure of the labor m arket, whether it ’s the narrow unemployment rate, the broader unemployment rate, the number of people working in part -time jobs who want full -time work, the level of job openings, the quit  rate, the di fficulty that firms are facing in hiring workers, the level of confidence we see in surveys about the labor m arket —all of that is pointing to vast and conti nuing improvement in the labor m arket ."
" And all of that is good, and I think that the American people sho uld feel the steps we ’re tak ing to normalize monetary policy are ones that we feel are well justified, given the very substantial progress we ’ve seen in the economy."
"Now, inflation is running below where we want it to be, and we ’ve talked about that a lot during this —the last hour."
" This past year , where it’s  not clear what the reasons are— I think it ’s not been mysterious in the past, but , one way or another , we have had four or five years in which inflation is running below our 2 percent objective , and we are also committed to achieving that."
" So the monetary policy path that we follow and the paths that my colleagues are writing down in our projections as ones they think will be appropriate given economic conditions are ones that September 20, 2017  Chair Yellen’s  Press Conference  FINAL  Page 25 of 25  we think are necessary to move inflation back up to 2 per cent and to maintain a strong labor market on a sustainable basis ."
" One risk is that if we tighten policy too quickly, we may find out that , although we don ’t think this now, that the inflation shortfall is something that’ s going to be persistent ."
" And if we tighten too quickly, we could undermine inflation performance —leave it at too low a level —inflation expectations could fall , and that could become ingrained, and that would be dangerous."
 And so that ’s a reason to be cautious about raising interest rates when inflation is as low as it is.
" But, on the other hand, we have a strong labor m arket and a low unemployment rate ."
" We think the economy could overheat, inflation could rise more quickly and above our objective ."
