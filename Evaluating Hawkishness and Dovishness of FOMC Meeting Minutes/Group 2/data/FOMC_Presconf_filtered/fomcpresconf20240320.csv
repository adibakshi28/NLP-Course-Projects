 My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.
" Inflation has eased substantially  while the labor market has remained strong , and that  is very good news."
" But inflation is still too high, ongoing progress in bringing it down is not assured, and the path forward is uncertain."
 We are fully committed to returning inflation to  our 2  percent goal.
"Today, the  FOMC  decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to reduce our securities holdings."
 Our restrictive stance of monetary policy has been putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation.
"  As labor market tightness has eased and progress on inflation has continued, the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals are moving into better balance ."
 I will have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments.
 Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a solid  pace.
 GDP growth in the fourth quarter of last year came in at 3.2 percent.
" For 2023 as a whole, GDP expanded 3.1 percent , bolstered by strong consumer demand as well as improving supply conditions."
 High interest rates also appear to have weigh ed on business fixed investment.
" In our Summary of Economic Projections, Committee participants generally expect GDP growth  to slow  from last year’s pace , with a median projection of 2.1 percent this year and 2 percent over the next two years."
" Participants generally revised up their growth projections since December, reflecting the strength of incoming data, including data on labor supply."
" March 20, 2024  Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  Page 2 of 24  The labor market remains relatively tight, but supply and demand conditions continue to come into better balance."
 The unemployment rate  has edged up but  remains low at 3.9 percent.
" Nominal wage growth  has been easing, and job v acancies have declined."
" Although the jobs -toworkers gap has narrowed, labor demand still exceeds the supply of available workers."
"  FOMC participants expect the rebalancing in the labor market to continue, easing upward pressure on inflation."
  The median unemployment rate projection in the SEP is 4.0 percent at the end of this year and 4.1 percent at the end of next year.
  Inflation has eased notably over the past year but remains above our longer -run goal of 2 percent.
"  Longer -term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters as well as  from  measures from financial markets."
"  The median projection in the SEP for total PCE inflation falls to 2.4 percent  this year , 2.2 percent next year,  and 2 percent in 2026."
 The Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.
" My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship as it erodes purchasing power, espe cially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation."
 We are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective.
" As labor market tightness has eased and progress on inflation has continued, the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals are coming into better balance."
" The economic outlook is uncertain, however, and we remain highly attentive to inflation risks."
 We know that reducing policy restraint too soon or too much could result in a reversal of the progress we have seen on inflation and ultimately require even tighter policy to get inflation back to 2 percent.
" At the same time, reducing policy restraint too  late or too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment."
 Th e Committee does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably  down  toward 2 percent.
" These projections are not a Committee decision or plan; if the economy does not evolve as projected, the path for policy will adjust as appropriate to foster our maximum -employment and price -stability goals."
We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keeping our longer -term inflation expectations well anchored.
 Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and price stability  over the long term.
" We , at the Fed, will do everything we can to achieve our maximum -employment and price -stability goals."
"  Mr. Chairman, the projections show somewhat higher core inflation ."
 They also show somewhat stronger growth.
" What should we infer from this notion that, on average , rates were kept the same this year , but inflation is higher and growth is higher."
 Does it mean more tolerance for higher inflation and less of a willingness to slow the economy to achieve that target?
" What it means is that , you know,  we’ve seen incoming —as I pointed out in my opening remarks, we did mark  up our growth forecast and so have many other forecasters, so the economy is performing , performing  well."
" And the inflation data came in a little bit higher is a separate matter , and I think that caused people to write up their inflation ."
" But nonetheless, we continue to make good progress on bringing inflation down ."
" When you —just to follow  up:  When you say that you ’re willing to either maintain the rate for longer, is —what is the tolerance of the Federal Reserve for inflation coming in above its 2 percent target?"
 We’re strongly committed to bringing inflation down to 2 percent over time.
" You and other s have been saying that relief on housing inflation is March 20, 2024  Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  Page 6 of 24  coming, but it still hasn ’t shown up meaningfully in the CPI or the PCE."
 So I think there ’s some confidence that the market rents —lower market rent increases that we ’re seeing will show up in measures of housing services inflation over time.
"  And will you be able to get overall inflation down to target if housing doesn ’t break through quickly, and does that affect the timing for eventual cuts this year?"
 We will get aggregate inflation down to 2 percent over time.
" And, and  I would assume that we ’ll continue to see is —we’ll see goods prices coming into a new equilibrium where they ’re going down  perhaps not as quickly as they had been earlier this year, where housing services inflation will come back down as , as current market rents are suggesting will happen and where nonhousing services will move back down."
 Some combination of those three things —and it may be different from the combination we had before the pandemic —will be achieved and will bring inflation back down to 2 percent sustainably.
"  Chair Powell, during your congressional testimony this month, you said that your test for making the first change to interest rates does not require you to be terribly comfortable that inflation is at 2 percent because interest rates are well  above neutral."
" We—we’re in a situation where , you know, if we ease —if we ease  too much or too soon, we could see inflation come back, and if we ease too late, we could do unnecessary harm to employment and people ’s working lives."
" And, fortunately , with the economy growing, with the labor market strong, and with inflation coming down, we can approach that question carefully and let the data speak on that."
 How much of that inflation that we ’ve seen so far this year do you chalk up to one -off calendar adjustment effects following a period of high inflation versus some change in the trend we saw  in the second half of last year?
"  But I take the two of them together , and I think they haven ’t really changed the overall story , which is that of inflation moving down gradually on a sometimes -bumpy road toward  2 percent."
" But, you know,  we didn ’t—the last thing I ’ll say is we didn ’t excessively celebrate the good inflation readings we got in the last seven months of last year."
  So I just would say that the Committee wants to see more data that gives us higher confidence that inflation is moving down sustainably toward 2 percent.
" I think it ’s, it’s—we think that rates were generally low during the prepandemic post –Global Financial Crisis era for reasons that are mostly , you know,  important, slow -moving , large things like demographics and productivity and that sort of thing —things that don’t move quickly."
6 percent core inflation for the end of this year.
" I mean , that doesn ’t sound like much disinflation at all."
 Is it right to say that this suggests you ’re not seeing a lot of disinflation this year compared to what we ’ve seen 2023 and so forth?
" Nonetheless, we ’re looking for data that confirm the kind of low readings that we had last year and give us a higher degree of confidence that what we saw was really inflation moving sustainably down to 2 percent —toward 2 percent."
" And just in general, if labor supply continued to rebound in 2024, the way it did in 2023, what would stronger hiring and possibly stronger growth mean for the path forward on policy?"
" So, so, if what we ’re getting is a lot of supply and a lot of demand , and that supply is actually feeding demand because workers are getting paid and they ’re spending and that ’s, you know —what you would have is potentially kind of what you had last March 20, 2024  Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  Page 11 of 24  year, which is a bigger economy where inflationary pressures are not increasing."
" So you can have that if you have a continued supply -side activity that we had last year with —both with supply ch ains and also with , with growth in the size of the labor force."
" I mean , we saw —you saw last year very strong hiring and inflation coming down quickly."
" We now have a better sense that a big part of that was supply -side healing, particularly with , with growth in the labor force."
"  So, in and of itself, strong job growth is not a reason , you know,  for us to be concerned about inflation."
" How do you assess the state of financial conditions right now , and particularly —in particular , do you view the kind of easing  in financial conditions since the fall as consistent and compatible with what you ’re trying to achieve on the inflation mandate?"
" But, ultimately, we do think that financial conditions are weighing on economic activity , and we think you see that in —a great place to see it is in the labor market , where you ’ve seen demand cooling off a little bit from the extremely high levels ."
 Things like that are really demand.
" There are also supply -side things happening, but I think those are demand -side things happening."
" We did see progress on inflation last year —significant progress , despite financial conditions sometimes being tighter, sometimes looser."
 Can you give us more color on how the Committee is thinking about inflation dynamics now?
" How does the Committee see this playing out forward, since you ’ve raised your inflation forecast?"
" You know, w e tend to see a little bit stronger —this is in the data —a little bit stronger inflation in the first half of the year, a little bit less strong later in the year."
" In the meantime, the economy is strong , the labor market is strong , inflation has come way down, and that gives us the ability to approach this question carefully and feel more confident that inflation is moving down sustainably at 2 percent when we take that step to begin dialing back our restrictive policy."
" Well , you’ve talked about the desire to have confidence that inflation is continually moving down."
 Have the recent numbers we ’ve gotten for inflation data dented that confidence at all?
" But I would say that the story is really essentially the same and that is of inflation coming down gradually toward 2 percent on a sometimes -bumpy path, as I mentioned."
" We’ve got nine months of 2 ½ percent inflation now , and we ’ve had two months of kind of bumpy inflation."
 It is very important for everyone that we serve that we do get inflation sustainably down .
"  You received a letter from Senators Elizabeth Warren and Sheldon Whitehouse that said —calling on you to lower interest rates —to cut interest rates because this has “the potential that it  may remain too high for too long, has halted advances in deploying renewable energy technologies and delayed significant climate and economic benefits from these projects."
”  So has higher interest rates caused that?
"  In this case, I would say, those are , you know —our mandate is for maximum employment and price stability and the other things that we do , and that ’s what we ’re trying to accomplish."
" We’re trying to do that in a way that sustains the strong growth we ’re seeing, the strong labor market we ’re seeing, but allows us to make further progress with inflation."
" So that ’s—but at the end of the day, we take that on  board , but we have to make our judgments , and we have to “stick to our knitting ”—which is maximum employment, price stability, supervise and regulate the banks, work on the payment system :  the things that we do."
" Obviously , inflation is some ways away from target ."
" Unemployment , though, if you look at the projection for the full year of 4.0 percent, in February , we were already at 3.9 percent, so quite close to the median projection."
 Are you concerned at all that —notwithstanding the very strong jobs growth —that in fact there may be some cracks appearing in the employment market?
 You’re seeing high job growth .
" You’re seeing strong wage growth , but wage growth is gradually moderating down to more sustainable levels ."
" You know, y ou do see things like the low —the low  hiring rate , and people have made the argument that if , if layoffs were to increase, that would —that would  mean that the net would be fairly quick increases in unemployment."
" So, you know,  we do expect the unemployment rate to —the forecast is that it would move up, I think , closer to what we see as the longer -run sustainable level ."
" We want to have a cushion, a b uffer , because we know that demand for reserves can be very volatile ."
" Chair Powell, you said you ’re waiting to become more confident that inflation ’s getting to your  2 percent goal before you cut rates."
" So we ’re—most importantly , we’re looking at the incoming inflation data and the contents of it and what they ’re telling us , so that ’ll be—and also the various components —so obviously that ’s what we want ."
 We want more confidence that inflation is coming down sustainably toward 2 percent.
 But the most important thing will be the inflation data coming in.
 It’s really inflation.
" We don ’t think that —the inflation was not originally caused —we think, I don ’t think, by mostly by wages."
" But we do think that , to get inflation back down to  2 percent sustainably, we ’d like to see , you know,  continuing gradual movement of wage increases at still high levels but back down to levels that are more sustainable over time."
" I guess I ’d put it this way :  The—if you look at the incoming inflation data that we ’ve had for January and February, I think very broadly that suggests that we were  right to wait until we ’re more confident."
"  Not to harp too much more on confidence and inflation , but you did say earlier in this press conference that the recent inflation data hasn ’t raised anyone ’s confidence."
" But March 20, 2024  Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  Page 24 of 24  when you testified before the Senate a couple weeks ago, you told lawmakers that you are “not far from receiving the confidence needed on inflation to begin cutting rates."
" So let me say my main message at that —in those two days of hearings was really that the Committee needs to see more evidence to build our confidence that inflation is moving down sustainably toward our 2 percent goal , and we don ’t expect that it will be appropriate to begin to reduce rates until we ’re more confident  that that is the case."
  We had a series of inflation readings over the second half of last year that were really much lower .
" We would , of course , love to get great inflation data."
 We got really good inflation data on the second —in the second part of last year .
