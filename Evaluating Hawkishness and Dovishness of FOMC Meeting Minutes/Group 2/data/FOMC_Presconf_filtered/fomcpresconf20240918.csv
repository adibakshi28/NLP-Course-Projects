 My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on achieving our dual -mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices for the benefit of the American people.
  Inflation has eased substantially from a peak of 7 percent to an estimated 2.2 percent as of August.
 We’re committed to maintaining our economy ’s strength by supporting maximum employment and returning inflation to our 2 percent goal.
" Today , the Federal Open Market Committee decided to reduce the degree of policy restraint by lowering our policy interest rate by ½  percentage point."
" This decision reflects our growing confidence that with an appropriate recalibration of our policy stance, strength in the labor market can be maintained in a context of moderate growth and inflation moving sustainably down to 2 percent."
 I will have more to say about monetary policy after briefly revi ewing economic developments.
 Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace.
"  GDP rose at an annual rate of 2.2 percent in the first half of the year, and available data point to a roughly similar pace of growth this quarter."
"  Growth of consumer spending has remained resilient, and investment in equipment and intangibles has picked up from its anemic pace last year."
  Improving supply conditions have supported resilient demand and the strong performance of the U.S. economy over the past year.
" In our Summary of Economic Projections, Committee participants generally expect GDP growth to remain solid, with a median projection of 2 percent over the next few years."
 The unemployment rate has moved up but remains low at 4.2 percent.
" Nominal wage growth has eased over the past year , and the jobs -toworkers gap has narrowed."
 The labor market is n ot a source of elevated inflationary pressures.
  The median projection for the unemployment rate in the SEP is 4.
Inflation has eased notably over the past two years but remains above our longer -run goal of 2 percent.
" Longer -term inflation expectations appear to remain well  anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters as well as measur es from financial markets."
"  The median projection in the SEP for total PCE inflation is 2.3 percent this year and 2.1 percent next year, somewhat lower than projected in June."
 Our monetary policy actions are guided by our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.
"  For much of the past three years, inflation ran well above our 2 percent goal, and labor market conditions were extremely tight."
"  Our primary focus had been on bringing down inflation, and appropriately so."
" We are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship , as it erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation."
" September 18, 2024 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference  FINAL  Page 3 of 26   Our restrictive monetary policy has helped restore the  balance between aggregate supply and demand, easing inflationary pressures and ensuring that inflation expectations remain well anchored."
" Our patient approach over the past year has paid dividends:   Inflation is now much closer to our objective, and we have gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent."
" As inflation has declined and the labor market has cooled, the upside risks to inflation have diminished, and the downside risks to employment have increased."
" We now see the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals as roughly in balance, and we are attentive to the risks to both sides of our dual mandate."
" In light of the progress on inflation and the balance of risks, at today ’s meeting , the Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by ½ percentage point to 4¾ percent to 5 percent."
 This recalibration of our policy stance will help maintain the strength of the economy and the labor market and will continue to enable further progress on inflation as we begin the process of moving toward a more neutral stance.
 We know that reducing policy restraint too quickly could hinder progress on inflation.
" At the same time, reducing restraint too slowly could unduly weaken economic activity and employment."
" These median projections are lower than in June, consistent with the projections for lower inflation and higher unemployment, as well as the changed balance of risks."
" As the economy evolves, monetary policy will adjust in order to best promote our maximum -employment and price -stability goals."
" If the economy remains solid and inflation persists, we can dial back policy restraint more slowly."
"  If the labor market were to weaken unexpectedly or inflation were to fall more quickly than anticipated, we are prepared to respond."
The Fed has been assigned two goals for monetary policy— maximum employment and stable prices.
"  We remain committed to supporting maximum employment, bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal, and keeping longer -term inflation expectations well anchored."
 We at the Fed will do everyt hing we can to achieve our maximum -employment and price -stability goals.
 The inflation data last week came out a little firmer than expected .
" We’ve had the two employment reports, July and August ."
" We’ve also had two inflation reports, including one that came in during blackout ."
" If you look at the SEP, you’ ll, you’ll  see that it ’s, it’s a process of recalibrating our policy stance away from where we had it a year ago, when inflation was high and unemployment low, to a place that ’s more appropriate given where we are now and w here we expect to be."
 Does that threaten the weakening of the job market that you said you’ d like to avoid?
" September 18, 2024 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference  FINAL  Page 7 of 26   We know —if you go back, we know that the policy stance we adopted in July of 2023 came at a time when unemployment was 3½ percent and inflation was 4.2 percent."
" Today , unemployment is up to 4.2 percent ; inflation ’s down to a few tenths above 2."
 So we know that it is time to recalibrate our policy to something that is more appropriate given the progress on inflation and on employment moving to a more sustainable level .
" We made a good, strong start to this , and that ’s really, frankly, a sign of our confidence —confidence that inflation is , is coming down toward 2 percent on a sustainable basis."
 You and your colleagues in your economic projections today see the unemployment rate climbing to 4.4 percent and staying there.
" Obviously, historically , when the unemployment rate climbs that much over a relatively short period of time, it doesn’ t typically just stop —it continues increasing."
" It ’s growing at a solid pace, inflation is coming down, the labor market is in a strong pace, we want to keep it there."
" Chair Powell, does today’ s action constitute a catch -up in action given recent substantial revisions to the employment data, or is this larger -thantypical rate cut a function of the elevated nominal level of the policy rate such that an accelerated cadence could be expected to continue?"
" It was, is this about what happened in the employment data between this meeting and the last meeting?"
" So I think it ’s about —we come into this with a policy position that was put in place, as you know, I mentioned, in July of 2023, which was a time of high inflation and very low unemployment."
" We’ve waited , and I think that that patience has really paid dividends in the form of our confidence that inflation is moving sustainably under 2 perc ent."
  Just following up on Jeanna ’s question on rising unemployment .
" Is it your view that this is just a function of a normalizing labor market amid improved supply, or is there anything to suggest that something more concerning perhaps is taking place here, given that other metrics of labor demand have softened too?"
" So I think what we ’re seeing is, clearly labor market conditions have cooled off by any measure, as I talked about in Jackson Hole, and—but they’ re still at a level—the level of those conditions is actually pretty close to what I would call maximum employment."
" In the meantime, if you look at the growth in economic activity data , retail sales data that we just got, second -quarter GDP —all of this indicates an economy that is still growing at a solid pace."
" You’re pricing in, basically by the end of next year, 200 basis points of cuts just to maintain a higher unemployment rate."
" Would you be moving to a more preemptive monetary policy style —rather than , as you did with inflation, waiting until the data gave you a signal?"
" We are more— we have greater confidence now that inflation is moving down to 2 percent, but , at the same time, our plan is that we will be at 2 percent, you know, over time."
" I ’m just curious as to how sensitive you’ ll be to the labor market, since you forecast we are going to see higher unemployment and it is going to take a significant amount of monetary easing to just maintain it."
" So, you know, what I would say is , we don’ t think we need to see further loosening in labor market conditions to get inflation down to 2 percent."
 We’re trying to achieve a situation where we restore price stability without the kind of painful increase in unemployment that has come sometimes with disinflation.
 You’re describing this view that you don’ t think you’ re behind when it comes to the job market.
"  You’ve mentioned a couple , but would you be able to walk us through what that dashboard told you, as far as what you know about the job market now?"
" So we ’ll start with unemployment, which is the single most important one probably ."
 That’s a very healthy unemployment rate.
" Wages are still a bit above what would be their —wage increases, rather , are still just a bit above where they would be over the very longer  term to be consistent with 2 percent inflation, but they ’re very much coming down to what that sustainable level is."
" There are many, many employment indicators ."
" The question isn’ t the level ; the question is that there has been change, particularly over the last few months , and, you know, so what we say is, as the risks, the upside risks, to inflation have really come down, the September 18, 2024 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference  FINAL  Page 14 of 26   downside risks to employment have increased ."
" And, and because we have been patient and held our fire on cutting while , while inflation has come down, I think we ’re now in a very good position to manage the risks to both of our goals."
  So—and inflation data .
" So , if you’ re having millions of people come into the labor force then, and you’ re creating September 18, 2024 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference  FINAL  Page 15 of 26   100,000 jobs, you’ re going to see unemployment go up."
" We understand there ’s been quite an influx across the borders, and that has actually been one of the things that ’s, that’s, that’s  allowed the unemployment rate to rise ."
" On the  Beveridge c urve question, yes, so we all felt, on the Committee, not all , but I think everyone on the Committee felt that job openings were so elevated that they could fall a long way before you hit the part of the curve where job openings turned into higher unemployment, job loss."
" And yes, I mean, I think we are —it’s hard to know that —you can’ t know these things with great precision, but certainly it appears that we ’re very close to that point, if not at it , so that further declines in job openings  will translate more directly into unemployment."
" I mean , we’ve seen a lot of , of tightness come out of the labor market in that form without it resulting in lower employment."
" More specifically, the economy is growing at a solid pace, inflation is coming down closer to our 2 percent objective over time, and the labor market is still in solid shape ."
" And we ’ll do that by returning rates from their high level, which has really been—the purpose of  which has been to get inflation under control."
" Listening to you talk about inflation moving meaningfully down to 2 percent, is the Federal Reserve effectively declaring a decisive victory over inflation and rising prices?"
" So inflation, you know —what we say is we want inflation —the goal is to have inflation move down to 2 percent on a sustainable basis."
 I just would love to know kind of how the Committee is thinking about the persistence we ’ve seen in housing inflation.
"  You know, do you think you can return to 2 percent with housing inflation where it is?"
" So housing inflation is the —is the one piece that is kind of dragging a bit, if I can say."
" But , you know, the direction of travel is clear, and as long as market rents remain , you know, relatively low inflation, over time that will show up, just the time it’s taking now , several years rather than just one or two cycles of annual lease renewals."
 So I would say it ’s—the rest of the portfolio —or of the elements that go into core PCE inflation have behaved pretty well.
" We will get down to 2 percent inflation, I believe, and I believe that , ultimately , we’ll get what we need to get out of the housing services piece, too."
"  Some of your colleagues have expressed concern that , with starting to cut rates , you could re -ignite demand in housing and see prices go up even more."
" So it ’s not , you know, obvious  how much addi tional demand that would make."
" And, I mean , ultimately by getting inflation broadly down and getting those rates normalized and getting the housing cycle normalized, that ’s the best thing we can do for house holders ."
" Just following up on some of the labor market talk earlier, you know, monetary policy operates with long and variable lags, and I’m wondering how much you see being able to keep the unemployment rate from raising too much comes from the fact that you’ re starting to act now and that ’s going to give people more room to run versus just the labor market is strong."
"  I think that ’s not —you know, that doesn’ t really answer the question that we ask ourselves, which is , let’s look, you know —at this meeting we’ re looking back to the July employment report, the August employment report, the two CPI reports, one of which came , of course , during blackout, and all of the other things that I mentioned ."
" Well, what I can say to the public is that we had the highest —we had a burst of inflation ."
" Many other countries around the world had a similar burst of inflation, and, when that happens , part of the answer is that we raise interest rates in order to cool the economy off in order to reduce inflationary pressures."
" It’s not something that people experience as pleasant, but , at the end , what you get is low inflation restored, price stability restored ."
" And a good definition of price stability i s that people in their daily decisions, they’ re not thinking about inflation anymore."
"  That’s where everyone wants to be , is back to what ’s inflation, you know?"
" Price stability benefits everybody over a long period of time , just by virtue of the fact that they don ’t have to deal with inflation."
" And, of course , people are  [still] experiencing high prices , as opposed to high inflation."
 Does that put your focus overwhelmingly on the unemployment rate?
" You know, it will be —the unemployment rate ’s very important, of course, but there isn’ t a single statistic or single bright line over which that thing that might move that would dictate one thing or another."
" We’ll look at—each meeting , we’ll look at all the data on inflation, economic activity, and the labor market , and we ’ll make decisions about , is our policy stance where it needs to be to foster over the medium term our mandate goals ?"
" But , in general, can you talk about whether or not you believe a sitting U.S. president should have a say in F ed decisions on interest rates?"
 And the reason is that people have found over time that insulating the central bank from direct control by political authorities avoids making monetary policy in a way that favors maybe people who are in office as opposed to people who are not in office.
" So that ’s the idea, is that —you know, I think the data are clear that countrie s that have independent central banks, they get lower inflation ."
 It’s just maximum employment and price stability on behalf of all Americans.
" You said earlier that the decision today reflects with appropriate recalibration strength in the labor market that could be maintained in the context of moderate growth, even though the policy statement says you view the risks to inflation and job growth as roughly balanced."
"  Given what you’ ve said , though, today, I ’m curious, are you more worried about the job market and growth than inflation?"
" So if you go back for a long time, the risks were on inflation."
 And we had inflation way above target.
" So, you know, that said to us, concentrate on inflation, concentrate on inflation."
" And we did for a while , and we kept at that, that the stance that we put in place 14 months ago was a stance that wa s focused on bringing down inflation."
" Part of bringing down inflation,  though, is cooling off the economy and a little bit cooling off the labor market."
" You see—you see growth at a solid rate, you see inflation coming down, and you see a labor market that ’s, that’s  still at very solid levels."
