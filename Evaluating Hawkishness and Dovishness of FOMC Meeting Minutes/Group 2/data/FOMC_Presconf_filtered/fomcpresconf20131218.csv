" The Committee also clarified its guidance on interest rates, emphasizing that the current near -zero range for the federal funds rat e target likely will remain appropriate well past the time that the unemployment rate declines below 6½ percent, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee’s 2 percent longer -run goal."
" Notably, despite significant fiscal headwinds, the economy has been expanding at a moderate pace, and we expect that growth will pick up somewhat in coming quarters, helped by highly accommodative monetary policy and waning fiscal drag."
" The job market has continued to improve, with the unemployment rate having declined further."
" At the same time, the recover y clearly remains far from complete, with unemployment still elevated and with both underemployment and long -term unemployment still major concerns."
 Inflation has been running below the Committee’s longer -run objective of 2 percent.
" The Committee recognizes that inflation persistently below its objective could pose risks to economic December 18, 2013  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  Page 2 of 31  performance and is monitoring inflation developments carefully  for evidence that inflation will move back toward its objective over time ."
" As always, each participant’s projections are conditioned on his or her own view of appropriate monetary policy."
 FOMC participants generally expect economic growth to pick up somewhat over the next few years.
" Their projections for increases in gross domestic product have a central tendency of 2.2 to 2.3 percent for 2013, rising to between 2.8 and 3.2 percent for next year, with similar growth estimates for 2015 and 2016."
" Participants see the unemployment rate, which was 7 percent in November, as continuing to decline."
 The central tendency of the projections has the unemployment rate falling to between 6.3 and 6.6 percent in the fourth quarter  of 2014 and then to between 5.3 and 5.8 percent by the final quarter of 2016.
" Meanwhile,  FOMC participants continue to see inflation running below our 2 percent objective for a time but moving gradually back toward 2 percent as the economy expands."
" The central tendency of their inflation projections for 2013 is 0.9 to 1.0 percent, rising to 1.4 to 1.6 percent for next year and to between 1.7 and 2.0 percent in 2016."
" For example, since we began the current purchase program, the economy has added about 2.9 million jobs and the unemployment rate has fallen by more than a  percentage point, to 7 percent."
" For comparison, when we started the program, many forecasters saw the unemployment rate remaining near December 18, 2013  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  Page 3 of 31  8 percent throughout  2014."
 Recent economic indicators have increased our confidence that the job market gains will con tinue.
" For example, nonfarm payrolls have recently been increasing at a pace of about 200,000 jobs per month, and the unemployment rate has fallen by 0.6 percentage point since June."
" With fiscal restraint likely diminishing and with signs that household spending is picking up, we expect economic growth to be strong enough to support further job gains."
" Further, FOMC participants now see the risks around their forecasts of growth and unemployment as having become more nearly balanced, rather than tilted in  an unfavorable direction as they were at the inception of the asset purchase program."
" Our sizable and sti llincreasing holdings will continue to put downward pressure on longer -term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and make financial conditions more accommodative, which in turn should promote further progress in the labor market and help move inflation back toward the Committee’s objective  of 2 percent."
" If the incoming data broadly support the Committee ’s outlook for  employment and inflation , we will likely reduce the pace of securities purchases in further measured steps at future meetings."
"With unemployment still well above its longer -run normal rate, which Committee participan ts currently estimate to be between 5.2 and 5.8 percent, and with inflation continuing to run below the Committee’s 2 percent longer -term objective, highly accommodative monetary policy remains appropriate."
" For the past year, the Committee has said that the current low target range for the federal funds rate would be appropriate at least as long as the une mployment rate remained above 6 ½ percent, inflation was projected to be no more than half a percentage point above our 2 percent longer -run goal, and longer -term inflation expectations remained well anchored."
" With many FOMC participants now projecting that the 6 ½ percent unemployment threshold will be reached by the end of 2014, the Committee decided to provide additional information about how it expects its policies to evolve after th e threshold is crossed."
" Based on its assessment of current conditions and the outlook, which is informed by a range of indicators, including measures of labor market conditions, financial conditions, and inflation pressures, the Committee now anticipates it will like ly be appropriate to maintain the current federal funds rate target well past the time that the unemployment rate  declines to below 6½ percent, especially if projected inflation continues to run below its 2 percent goal."
" In part , December 18, 2013  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  Page 5 of 31  this expectation reflects  our assessment, based on a comprehensive set of indicators, that there will still be a substantial amount of slack in the labor market when the unemployment rate falls to 6½ percent."
" This continuing job market slack imposes heavy costs on the unemployed and the underemployed and their families and reduces our nation’s productive capacity, warranting our ongoing highly accommodative policy."
" But, as the last phrase of the enhanced guidance underscores, the prospects for inflation provide another reason to keep policy accommodative."
" The Committee is determined to avoid inflation that is too low as well as inflation that is too high, and it anticipates keeping rates low at least until it sees inflation clearly moving back toward its 2 percent objective."
" Although the central tendency of the projected unemployment rate for the fourth quarter of next year encompasses 6 ½ percent, 15 of 17 FOMC participants do not expect a rate increase before 2015."
" In summary, reflecting cumulative progress and an improved outlook for the job market, the Committee decided today to modestly reduce the monthly pace at which it  is adding to the longer -term securities on  its balance sheet ."
" The FOMC also provided additional guidance on future short -term interest rates, stating that it expects to December 18, 2013  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  Page 6 of 31  maintain the federal funds target in its current near -zero range well past the time that the unemployment rate falls below 6 ½ percent, especially if projected inflation continues to run below 2 percent."
" The Federal Reserve’s enhanced guidance about its policy intentions and i ts substantial and stillincreasing holdings of longer -term securities will ensure that monetary policy remains highly accommodative, consistent with the pursuit of its mandated objectives of maximum employment and price stability."
" If we ’re making progress in terms of inflation and continue d job gains —and I imagine we ’ll continue to do, probably at  each meeting , a measured reduction—t hat would take us to late in the year , certainly not by the middle of the year."
" Finally, when you say “ well pas t” the unemployment rate of 6½ percent, why not pick a number ?"
"On the issue  of another number, the unemployment rate —let ’s talk first about the labor market condition."
 The unemployment rate is a good indicator of  the labor market .
 And so we were comfortable setting a 6.5 percent unemployment rate as the point at which we would begin to look at a more broad set of labor market indicators .
" However, precisely because we don’ t want to look just at the unemployment rate, we want to —once we get to 6½—we want to look at hiring, quits, vacancies, participation, longterm unemployment, et cetera, wages ."
" We couldn ’t put it in terms of another unemployment  rate level , specifically ."
" Mr. Chairman, your inflation forecasts never get back to 2 percent in the time horizon that you cover here , out to 2016."
" Given t hat, why should we believe the F ed has a symmetric inflation target ?"
" And, in particular, why should we believe you’ re following an optimal policy —optimal  control policy , as you’ve said in the past —given that that would imply inflation going a bit above target at some point ?"
" We do think that inflation will grad ually move back to 2 percent , and we allow for the possibility , as you know , in our guidance that it could go as high as 2½ percent ."
" Even though inflation has been quite low in 2013, let me give you the case for why inflation might rise ."
" Secondly, if you look at the fundamentals for inflation , incl uding inflation expectations , whether measured by financial markets o r surveys ; if you look at growth, which we now anticipate w ill be picking up bot h in the U .S."
"and internationally; if you look at wages , which have been growing at 2 percent and a little bit higher according to many indicators —all of these things suggest that inflation will gradually pick up."
 It’s not easy to —inflation cannot be picked up and move d where you want it .
" But we are very committed to making sure that inflation does not stay too low , and we are continuing to monitor that very carefully and to take whatever actions necessary to achieve that."
" Well, even under optimal control, it would take a while for inflation —inflation is quite —can be quite inertial ."
 And the responsi veness  of inflation to increasing economic activity is quite low .
" So—and particularly given an environment where we have falling oil prices and other factors that are contributing downward forces on inflation, i t’s difficult to get inflation to move quickly to target ."
" But we are, December 18, 2013  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  Page 10 of 31  again , committed to doing what’ s necessary to get inflation back to target over the next couple of years."
" And to kind of bounce off Robin, it ’s very striking that inflation has fallen  while QE3 has been in place , and the economy continues to undershoot the FOMC ’s forecast ."
" And , in particular, it can ’t do anything about a slowing in potential growth, which appears to have happen ed, at least to some extent ."
" In particular, as I ’ve mentioned many times, the Congressional Budget Office assessed the fiscal drag in 2013 as being about  1½ percentage points of growth."
 We ’re looking like we ’re going to get in the low 2s actual growth .
" In our guidance today —December 18, 2013  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  Page 11 of 31  we strengthen ed our guidance to make clear that we expect to keep rates low well beyond the point that  unemployment hits 6½ percent."
" And if you look at the cumulative improvement —and I mentioned some figures in my opening remarks —or if you look at recent numbers , either on employ ment, unemployment."
" And also in terms of growth, we ’re seeing encouraging numbers in terms of household spending , for example, auto purchases, fiscal drag is reduced, stronger numbers internationally ."
" As you look at our projections, you’ ll see we only assume or project a small pickup in growth going into next year ."
" Now, it is true that while we have pass ed the—or , made significant progress on the labor market and growth hurdles, there is still this question about inflation, which is a bit of a concern —more than a bit of concern, as we indicated in our statement ."
" Our outlook December 18, 2013  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  Page 12 of 31  is still for inflation to go b ack to 2 percent ."
" But we take that very seriously , and if inflation does not show signs of returning to target, we will take appropriate action."
" We have—with interest rates near zero, we can manage our forward guidance, and I think that has been helpful, that ’s been effective."
" We can change the interest rate we pay on r eserves , which is something we ’ve talked about ."
" The related broader question is , you are a historian of monetary policy ."
 What do you think future historians of monetary policy will have to say about your eight years at the Federal Reserve helm?
" But , clearly , this is —unless you put aside the D epression , where monetary policy was , on the whole , pretty passive —this is the first—one of the first examples , at least , of aggressive monetary policy taking place in a near -zero interest rate environment ."
" Chairman B ernanke, today , with one hand, you’re giving the economy something by telling us that or signaling that you may keep interest rates lower for longer than we previously thought ."
 Our main tool is interest rate policy .
" So, our view was —in September 2012—was that we had interest rates already low, and they were expected to stay low for a good long time ."
" Our sense was once that intermediate objective was attained —that is, when the economy had grown and was moving forward —that , at that point , we could begin to wind down the secondary tool, the supplementary tool, and achieve essentially the same amount of accommodation using interest rates and for ward  guidance."
 We don’ t think that there ’s an inflation problem or anything like that.
 And now we ’ve also clarified our guidance that we will be keeping rates low well pas t unemployment of 6.5 percent .
 It is true that the purchases are —we view as supplementary to the interest rate policy .
" In an earlier response, you sort of laid out the argument against —or sort of explain ed why the C ommittee didn ’t lower the 6.5 percent unemployment threshold."
 Has there been any other further discussion on perhaps adding a lower bound to the inflation target as well ?
" And then, specifically on inflation, w hat tools or actions could the C ommittee take if inflation continues to run below your target or even falls further?"
" We want to see how much accommodation we have and w hether it ’s sufficient , whether the economy is continuing to grow, a nd inflation is moving back toward  target , as we anticipate."
" And while the view of the C ommittee was that the best way forward today was in this more qualitative approach, which incorporates elements both of the unemployment th reshold and the inflation floor, t hat further strengthening would be possible , and it ’s something that has  certainly not been ruled out ."
" So while , again, while we think that we can provide a high level of accommodation with a somewhat slo wer pace—but still very high pace —of asset purchases and December 18, 2013  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  Page 17 of 31  our interest rate policy , we do have other things we can do if we need to ramp up again."
" That being said, we ’re hopeful that the economy will c ontinue to make progress , and that we ’ll begin to see the whites of the eyes of the end of the recovery and the beginning of the more normal period of economic growth."
" Some members of your staff published a paper earlier this fall arguing that in times of high unemployment— and, particularly , when some of that unemployment is calcifying into disengagement —there’ s an argument for monetary policy to be even more aggressive ."
" It’s—of course , that ’s something for econometricians and historians to grapple with, but there have been a number of factors which have contributed to slower growth ."
" All that being said, we have  been disappointed in the pace of growth , and we don ’t fully understand why ."
" You just talked a little bit about fiscal policy and now Congress has —is set to pass a budget deal , and they haven ’t really done much to reduce the deficit ."
" There are a lot of experts on central banking, a lot of experts on monetary policy ."
" Of course, we can ’t do anything about long -run employment opportunities , but we can help the economy recover more quickly ."
" I would note, by the way, that at the current moment, it doesn ’t really matter whether we have one mandate or two , because we’ re below our inflation target and we—unemployment is above where we ’d like it to be ."
" And then the broader question— your pred ecessor, Dr. Greenspan, in his new book ar gues that long -term investment—one of the reasons we may be seeing such a slow economy is that people are afraid debt and deficits are reducing long -term investment ."
" Do you feel that debt and deficits are weighing down these sorts of long -term decisionmaking , and does it argue for m ore drastic action on the short -term?"
" Usually, you think that the way that a deficit or a long -term debt would affect investment would be through what ’s called “crowding out ”—that is,  raising interest rates ."
" But high interest rates —we may have many problems , but high interest rat es is not our problem right now ."
 There’ s plenty of —particularly for larger firms —there’ s plenty of credit available at low interest rates .
" But I think that  it’s going to take faster overall growth to get firms trying to expand capacity , and I think if we —if consumer spending increases , as we think it December 18, 2013  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  Page 25 of 31  will, and if exports increase, as they seem to be doing, then we ’ll probably see greater investment as well."
" We do think, again , of the asset purchases as a secondary tool behind interest rate policy , and we do think that the cost –benefit ratio , particularly as the assets on the balance sheet get large, that it moves in a way that’ s less favorable."
" But it could be  that if interest rates rise quickly, for example, that we would be in a situation of not giving remittances to the T reasury for a couple of years , and that would create problems , no doubt , for the Fed in terms of c ongressional response ."
" I think, for example, that an important difference between asset purchases and interest rate policy is that asset purchases work by affecting what is called the  “term premium,”  whic h is essentially the additional part of the interest rate which investors require as compensation for holding longer -term securities ."
" So there are a number of reasons why asset purchases, while effective, while I thin k they have been important, are less attractive tools than traditional interest rate policy , and that ’s the reason why we have relied primarily on interest rates , but used asset purchases as a supplement when we’ ve needed it to keep forward progress ."
" We don’ t think t hat that ’s happened to an extent  which is a danger to the system , except other than that when those positions unwind, like we saw over the summer, they can create some bumpiness in interest rate markets , in particular ."
" That being said, I don ’t think that you can completely ignore financial stability concerns in monetary policy because we can ’t control them perfectly , and there may be situa tions when financial instability December 18, 2013  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  Page 27 of 31  has implications for our mandate, which is jobs and inflation, which we saw , of co urse, in the Great Recession ."
" I recall in Jackson Hole  last year, you cited  a study that said the first $2 trillion in  asset purchases had boost ed GDP by about 3 percent and increased private -sector employment by 2 million jobs ."
" To repeat one of them, t he Blue Chip forecast s for unemployment in this current quarter —made before we beg an our program —were on the order 7.8 percent , and that December 18, 2013  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  Page 28 of 31  was before th e fiscal cliff deal, which even —created even more fiscal headwinds for the economy ."
" I mean , the asset purchases brought down long -term interest rates, brought down mortgage rates, brought down corporate bond yields , brought down car loan interest rates, and we’ ve seen the response in those areas as the economy has done better ."
" Unemployment benefits , as you know , are expiring  shortly for more than a million people , and many more people will see their benefits e nd next year."
" And , secondly, what effect would you exp ect that will have on the unemployment rate ?"
" Could it —if those people drop out of the labor force, then could that knock the employment rate down quite a bit?"
" The effects of ending extended unemployment benefits , quantitatively , for the economy overall , are probably not very large because they work in two directions ."
 People receiving unemployment benefits obviously tend to spend a very high fraction of their income .
 That is a positive fo r growth .
" On the other side, it —probably some folks who are— can no longer qualify for unemployment benefits will just drop out of the labor  force, and that will bring the unemployment rate down , but, for some sense , the wrong reason."
" So, overall , it will have —it could have a very small effect on the measured unemployment rate."
" And so, I hope that when they do review the Fed, if that ’s what they do, again, that they rely on expertise and highly qualified individuals who know the ins and outs of central banking and monetary policy, which are not simp le matters ."
" On t he question of longer -term unemployment and the drop in labor force participation, how much do you see that as the result of structural changes  going on in the economy at this point ?"
" So I think a lot of the unemployment decline that we ’ve seen , contrary to sometimes what you hear, I think a lot of it really does come from jobs as opposed to declining participation."
" The Fed can address that , to some extent , if—you know, if we ’re able to get the economy closer to December 18, 2013  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  Page 31 of 31  full employment, then some people who are discouraged or who have been unemployed for a long time might find that they have opportunities to rejoin the labor market ."
" There are many, many factors that affect participation —employment, wages , and so on, but the one I think that we can most directly affect is the skill level of our workforce ."
