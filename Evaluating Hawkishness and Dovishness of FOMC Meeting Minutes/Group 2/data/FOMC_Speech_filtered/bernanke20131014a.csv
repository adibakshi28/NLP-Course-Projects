" The 1970s through the mid -1990s  in particular  were marked by episodes  of high inflation, boom -andbust cycles, and financial crises."
" However, the changes to the monetary policy framework, along with greater fiscal discipline and the adoption of a more flexible exchange rate, soon bore fruit ."
" Notably, inflation fell to single -digit levels by the early 2000s."
"  And i n 2001 the Bank of Mexico formally adopted an inflation -targeting regime, which --outside  of some temporary fluctuations --has succeeded in kee ping inflation at around 4  percent."
" Importantly, the improved monetary policy framework, together with other reforms, has thus far helped reduce Mexico’s susceptibility to financial crises."
" When the recent financial crisis in the United States and other a dvanced economies  threatened to spill over to Mexico, the inflation credibility enjoyed by the Bank of Mexico allowed it to counter economic weakness by easing monetary conditions, even though headline  - 2 - inflation was  running above its target range  at the ti me."
" Strong countercyclical policy actions of this type were  unlikely to have been  feasible in Mexico a few decades ago; with little in th e way of inflation -fighting credibility and an immature financial sector, the monetary authority in earlier years was often forced to respond to a crisis by tightening monetary conditions , rather than loosening them, in an effort to limit capital flight, e xchange rate depreciation, and increases in inflation."
 A broad consensus among economists --suppo rted by  considerable  empirical evidence --holds that a central bank’s credibility and effectiveness are enhanced when it is able to make monetary policy based on its assessment of what is in the economy’s longrun interest rather than in response to short -term political pressures.
" The Federal Reserve was also  less than fully independent during and just after World War II, when it agreed to  - 3 - keep Treasury yields at low levels to reduce the cost of financing wartime deficits."
" After the war, as inflation pressures rose, Federal Reserve policymakers wanted to retu rn to independent rate  setting , but the Treasury demurred, hoping to keep the cost of servicing the national debt low."
" During the 1980s, under the leadership of Chairman Paul Volcker, the Fed further established its credibility and independence by taking the necessary steps to bring inflation under control."
" As in Mex ico, the benefits of central bank independence in the United States ha ve included low inflation, wellanchored inflation expectations, and increased policy credibility, which contribut e to a more stable overall economic environment."
" Indeed, during the rec ent financial crisis and the ensuing recession, the Fed has been able to take aggressive monetary policy actions to help stabilize the economy without dislodging longer -term inflation expectations."
" To ensure appropriate accountability, while also making monetary policy more effective,  central banks in the United States, Mexico, and around the world have worked hard to increase  their transparency over the past 20  years or so."
" The Bank of Mexico has likewise significantly increased its transparency since becoming independent, through steps including the adoption of a target range for inflation, the regular publication of inflation reports and policy statements, and the timely release of minutes following each policy meeting."
