"  For release on delivery  7:15 p.m. EDT  April 11,  2012         The Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy     Remarks by   Janet L."
 The Money Marketeers are renowned for their keen interest in the economy a nd monetary policy .
" With that in mind, I’ll describe how my view s concerning the stance of monetary policy relate t o my assessment of the economic outlook ."
" As you know, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) issued statements  following its January and March me etings indicating that it “currently anticipate s that economic conditions --including  low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run --are likely to warrant exceptionally low level s for the federal funds rate at least through late 2014."
 Let me emphasize at the outset that the remainder of my remarks reflect my own views and not those of others in the Federal Reserve System.1  The Labor Market and t he Economic Outlook  I will start by describing current conditions and key features of the economic outlook  that influence my view s on the appropriate stance of monetary policy.
" Even so,  the economy  remains  far from f ull employment ."
" Furthermore, the improvement in labor market conditions has outpaced the seemingly moderate growth of output."
" Looking ahead, significant headwinds  are likely to continue to restrain aggregate spending, and progress in closing the remainin g employment gap is likely to be quite gradual."
" While the jump in energy prices is pushing up inflation temporarily , I anticipate that subsequently inflation w ill run at or below the Committee’s 2 percent objective for the foreseeable future."
" The unemployment rate  had hovered around 9 percent for much of last year but moved down in the fall and averaged  81/4 percent in the first three months of this year, about  13/4 percentage points lower than its peak during the recession."
" And even though the latest employment report was somewhat disappointing, private sector payrolls expanded, on average , by about 2 10,000 per month in the first quarter, up from gains averaging around 150,000 per month during most of 2011."
" The level of private payrolls remains nearly 5 million below its pre -recession peak, and the unemployment rate stands well above levels that  I, and most analysts , judge as normal over the longer run."
  Figure 1  shows the unemployment rate together with the outlook of professional forecasters from last month’s Blue Chip survey.2  The solid blue line shows the Blue                                                  2 The Blue Chip survey provides forecasts on  a quarterly basis only through the end of 2013.
 The figure  also shows the central tendency of the unemployment projections that my FOMC colleagues and I made at our January meeting:  Those projections reflect our asse ssments of the economic outlook given our own individual judgments about the appropriate path of monetary policy .
" As in the Blue Chip consensus outlook, FOMC participants’ projections indicate that unemployment will decline gradually from current levels."
" Included in the figure as well is the central tendency of FOMC participants’  estimates of the long errun normal  unemployment rate, which range s from 5 .2 percent to 6 percent."
 The unemployment rate is expected to remain well above its longer -run normal va lue over the next several years .
 Figure  2 illustrates the degree of uncertainty surrounding projections of unemployment .
" The gra y shading denotes a model -based 70 percent confidence interval for the unemployment rate , based on the sorts of shocks that have hit the economy over the past 40 years.3  Judging from historical experience, the consensus projection could be quite far off, in either direction ."
"                                                                                                                                                  to the April edition of the Blue Chip survey, which was released yesterday, “The con sensus outlook for U.S. economic growth this year and next underwent minimal change over the past month.”  3 The forecast confidence interval is generated using stochastic simulations of the Federal Reserve staff’s FRB/US model."
  - 4 - Some  observers question just how large the shortfall from full employment really is and hence  worry that further increases in aggregate demand could push up inflation.
 Their concern is that a large part of the rise in unemployment since 2007  is structural  rather than cyclical .
" I ag ree that the magnitude of structural unemployment  is uncertain , but I read the evidence as support ing the view that the bulk of the rise in unemployment that we saw in recent years wa s cyclical , not structural in nature."
" First, the fact that the rise in unemployment was q uite widespread across industry and occupation groups  casts doubt on the hypothesis that there has been an unusually large mismatch between the types of job vacancies and the types of workers available to fill them."
" Indeed , measures of th e dispersion of employment changes across industries did not increase more than past experience would have predicted given the depth of the recession."
" However, evidence from migration patterns suggests that house lock is not having a significant effect on the level of structural unemployment."
 The Beveridge curve plots  the relationship between unemployment and job vacancies .
" Cyclical variations in aggregate demand tend to move unemployment and job vacancies in opposite directions, whereas structural shifts would be expected to move vacan cies and unemployment in the same direction."
"  For instance, a structural mismatch between businesses’ hiring needs and the skills of unemployed workers would tend to push up the level of vacancies for a given level of unemployment."
"  Figure 3 plots the comovement of unemployment and job vacancy rate s since 2007.5  Consistent with a substantial decline  in aggregate demand , followed by some m odest recovery , movements in unemployment and vacancies since 2007 display a predominantly inverse relationship."
" Howev er, figure 3 shows that as job vacancies have risen during th e recovery, unemployment has declined by less than might have been expected based on the relationship  that prevailed during the contraction ."
" In my view, a  portion of this apparent outward shift in the Beveridge curve reflects  increases in the maximum duration of unemployment benefits , which  have been important in buffering the effects of                                                  4 See Raven Molloy, Christopher L."
" Vacancies typically adjust more quickly than unemployment to changes in labor demand, causing counterclockwise movements in vacancy -unemployment space that can look like shifts in the Beveridge curve."
" As can be seen, such counterclockwise movements also occurred during these two earlier deep  recessions .6  While I do not see much evidence of any significant increase in s tructural unemployment so far , I am concerned t hat structural unemployment could increase over time if the labor market heal s too slowly --a phenomenon known as hysteresis ."
 My concern is that i ndividuals with such long unemployment spells could become less employable as their skills deteriorate and as they lose their connection s to the labor market.
" For example, the probability of finding a new job  has not deteri orated more for individuals experiencing a longterm bout of unemployment relative to those facing                                                  6 See John Lindner  and Murat Tasci (2010), “ Has the Beveridge Curve Shifted?"
"” Economic Trends  (Cleveland: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, August ), www.clevel andfed.org/research/trends/2010/0810/02labmar.cfm ; and Rob Vallet ta and Katherine Kuang (2010), “ Is Structural Unemployment on the Rise?"
" Nonetheless, the risk that continued high unemploymen t could eventually lead to more -persistent structural problems  underscores the case for maintaining a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy."
"   Putting all the evidence together , I see  no good reason to doubt that ou r nation’s high unemployment rate indicate s a substantial degree of slack in the labor market."
" Moreover, while I recogniz e the significant uncertainty surrounding such forecast s, I anticipate that growth in real gross domestic product ( GDP ) will be sufficient to lower unemployment only gradually from this point forward , in part because substantial headwinds continue to restrain the recovery."
" We have seen some  improvement recently , but demand for housing is likely to pick up only gradually given still -elevated unemployment, uncertainties over the direction of house prices, and mortgage credit availability that seems likely to remain very restricted for all but the most creditworthy  buyers."
" When  housing demand does pick up more noticeably, the huge overhang of both unoccupied dwellings and homes in the foreclosure pipeline will likely allow demand to be met for a time without a sizable expansion in homebuilding."
  A third factor weighing on the outlook is the sluggish pace of economic growth abroad.
 A further slowdown in economic activity in Europe  and in other foreign economies would inhibit U.S. export growth.
  One consideration that further complicates this outlook is the inconsistency between recent movements in economic growth and employment:  Unemployment  has declined significantly over the past year  even though growth appears to have been only moderate .
" This unanticipated decline in the unemployment rate presents something of a puzzle , and it creates uncertainties for the outlook  and policy ."
"    To illustrate this puzzle, figure 5 plots changes in the unemployment rate against real GDP growth --a simple portrayal of the relationship known as Okun’s law."
" It is evident from the figure that  2011 is something of an outlier, with the drop in  the unemployment rate last year much large r than would seem con sistent with real GDP growth  below 2 percent ."
" One possibility , highlighted by Chairman Bernanke in a recent   - 9 - speech,  is that last year’s decline in unemployment represents a catch -up from the especially large job losses during late 2008 and 2009.7  Accordi ng to this hypothesis, employers slashed employment especially sharply during the recession, perhaps out of concern that the contraction could become even more severe; in particular, the figure shows that in 2009 , the unemployment rate rose by considerably  more  than the decline in GDP would have suggested."
" If last year’s Okun’s law puzzle was largely the result of such a catch -up in hiring, I would expect progress on the unemployment front to diminish  unless the pace of GDP growth picks up."
" Of course, there are other conceivable explanations for this puzzle , including some that would point to a faster decline in unemployment in coming years ."
" It will be important to pay close attention to indicators of both the labor market and GDP to try to gauge the likely pace of improvement in economic activity going forwar d and, hence , the appropriate stance of monetary policy over time."
  Let me now turn to inflation.
" Overall consumer price inflation has fluctuated quite a bit in recent years, largely reflecting movements in prices for oil and other commodit ies."
" For example, inflation moved up in the first part of 2011 as a rise in the                                                  7 See Ben S."
 Then inflation subsided a fter commodity prices came off their peaks.
" But smoothing through these fluctuations, inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures ( PCE) price index averaged 2 percent over the pas t two years."
 Using the price index excluding food and energy --another rough way to abstract from transitory fluctuations --inflation averaged about 11/2 percent over the past two years.
" These rates are lower than the inflation rates that were seen prior to the recession, and they are at or below the FOMC’s long -run goal of 2 percent inflation."
"    In my view, t he subdued inflation environment largely reflects two factors ."
" First, the substantial slack in the labor market has restrained inflation by holding down labor costs."
" Second, and of critical importance, longer -term inflation expectations have been remarkably stable."
" Like many other observers , I was concerned that inflation expectations might move lower during the recession, driving down both wages and prices in a self -reinforcing spiral ."
" Indeed, t he stability of expectations has meant that the price increases driven by costs of oil and other commodities have had only temporary effects on the rate of inflation."
" Although f irms passed higher input costs into their prices when they could do so , those one -time price increases have not led to an expectations -driven process that might have resulted  in persistently higher inflation."
  The same key factors that have kept core inflation subdued provide the rationale for my inflation forecast.
 I anticipate that  slack in the labor market will continue to   - 11 - restrain growth in labor costs and prices.
" And, g iven the stability of inflation expectations, I expect  that the latest round of gasoline price increases will also have only a temporary effect on overall inflati on."
" Indeed, if crude oil prices were to follow the downward -sloping path implied by current futures contracts, energy costs would serve as a restraining influence on overall inflation over the next several years ."
 Figure 6  presents the central tendency of  FOMC participants’ pr ojections of inflation at the ti me of our January meeting .
" Most expected inflation to be  at, or a bit below,  our long -run objective of 2 percent  through 2014 ; most private forecasters also appear to expect inflation by this measure to be close to 2 percent.8  As with unemployment, uncertainty around the inflation projection is substantial."
" Benchmarks for Assessing Monetary Policy:  Optimal Control   As I indicated at the outset  of my remarks , I supported the Committee’s statements in  January and March pertaining to the stance of monetary policy."
" I consider it essential, in making judgments  about the stance of  policy , to recognize at the outset the limits of our understanding regarding the dynamics of the economy and the transmission of monetary policy."
" Optimal control can be used , under certain assumptions,  to                                                  8 The Blue Chip survey reports inflation forecasts for the consumer price index (CPI), not the PCE price index."
" However, the Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) provides forecasts for both inflation measures, and we use the projected spreads between t he measures reported in the 2012Q1 release of the SPF (together with historical data) to convert the March Blue Chip CPI forecasts to a PCE basis."
   - 12 - obtain a prescription for the path of monetary policy conditiona l on a baseline forecast of economic conditions.
 Optimal control typically involves the selection of a particular model to represent the dynamics of the economy as well as the specification of a “loss function” that represents the social costs o f deviatio ns of inflation from the Committee’s longer -run goal and of deviations of unemployment from its longer -run normal rate.
" In effect, this approach assumes that the policymaker has perfect foresight about the evolution of the economy and that the private sec tor can fully anticipate the future path of monetary policy ; that is, the central bank’s plans are completely transparent and credible to the public .9   To show what an optimal control approach might have called for at the time of the January FOMC meeting , figure 7 depicts a purely illustrative baseline outlook constructed using the distribution of FOMC participants’ projections for unemployment, inflation, and the federal funds rate  that we published in January ."
" Here, t he baseline paths for unemployment and inflation track the midpoint of the central tendency of the Committee’s projections through 2014 ."
 The unemployment rate gradually converge s to around 5 -1/2 percent --roughly the midpoint of the central tendency of participants’ long -run projections of these factors --and inflation converges to the Committee’s longer -run goal of 2 percent .
"  This highly accommodative policy path generates, according to the FRB/US model, a notably faster reduction in unemployment than in the baseline outlook ."
" In addition, the inflation rate  runs close to the FOMC’s longer -run goal of 2 percent over coming years."
" One reason this exercise generates a  better outcome is because it assumes that the Federal Reserve’s inflation objective is  fully credible --that is, all households and businesses fully understand the Federal Reserve’s goals and believe that policymakers will follow the optimal policy designed to meet those goals."
 This  belief ties down longer -term inflation expectations  in the  model  even while it allows the lower interest rate to spur faster growth in output and employment .
" First, the FRB/US model’s projections of real activity, inflation, and interest rates are adjusted to replicat e the baseline forecast values reported in figure 7."
" The loss function is equal to the cumulative sum from 2012:Q2 through 202 5:Q4 of three factors --the (discounted) squared deviation of the unemployment rate from 5 -1/2 percent, the squared deviation of overall PCE inflation from 2 percent, and the squared quarterly change in the federal funds rate."
 The third term is added to da mp quarter -toquarter movements in interest rates.
"       - 14 - on the policy prescriptions obtained from these methods , so I simultaneously consider other approaches for gaug ing the appropriate stance of monetary policy."
 Alternative Benchmarks for Monetary Policy:  Simple Rules  An alternative approach that I find helpful in evaluating the stance of policy is to consult prescriptions from simple policy rules .
" Moreover, given our statutory mandate of maximum employment and price stability , it seems reasonable to focus on rules that mirror these two objectives by prescribing how the federal fund s rate should be adjusted in response to two gaps:  the deviation of inflation from its longer -run goal and the deviation of unemployment from my estimate of its longer -run normal rate ."
"Williams (2011), “Simple and Robust Rules for Monetary Policy,” in  Benjamin M."
"  - 15 - called Taylor principle, which s tates that, other things being equal, a central bank should respond to a p ersistent increase in inflation  by raising  nominal short -term interest rates by more than the increase in inflation so that the real rate  of interest rises, thereby helping to bring inflation back down ."
" Moreover , I think it is essential that policy rules incorporate a sufficiently strong response to resource slack, typically either the output gap or the unemployment gap , to help bring the economy back toward full employment expeditiously ."
" Importantly, because of the stabilizing effects of the Taylor principle, both the Taylor (1993) and Taylor (1999) rules i mply that inflation returns over time to the longer -run goal of 2 percent .14                                                   13 See John B."
"Taylor (1999), “A Historical Analysis of Monetary Policy Rules,” in John B."
"Taylor, ed., Monetary Policy Rules , (Chicago: University of Chicago Press), pp."
" Thus, if the economy’s  true equilibrium real funds rate deviated systematically from that value, the intercept term would need to be adjusted to ensure that the inflation rate converged over time to its longer -run goal."
" Many studies , including Taylor’s own analysis , suggest that the Taylor (1999 ) rule generates considerably less  variability in real activity and only slightly more variability in inflation than his original rule.16  Given the differential responses to economic slack across these two rules, this finding is hardly surprising , but it is a key reason  why I consider the Taylor  (1999 ) rule to be a more suitable guide for Fed policy ."
" In particular, this rule  does not fully take into account the implications of the zero lower bound  on nominal interest rates  and hence tends to understate the rationale for maintaining a highly accommod ative stance of monetary policy  under present circumstances ."
" The output gap in turn is approximated using Okun’s law; specifically, Yt = 2.3(5.6 -Ut), where 2.3 is the estimated value of the Okun’s law coefficient and 5.6 is the assumed value of the non -accelerating inflation rate of unemploymen t, or NAIRU."
"Taylor, ed., Monetary Policy Rules  (Chicago: University of Chicago Press), pp."
" In effect, there has been a significant shortfall in the  overall amount  of monetary policy stimulus since early 2009 relative to the prescriptions of the simple rules that I’ve described."
"  Analysis by some of my Federal Reserve colleagues suggests that monetary policy can produce better economic outcomes if it commits to making up for at least some portion of t he cumulative shortfall created by the zero lower bound --namely,  by maintaining a highly accommodative monetary policy for longer than a simple rule would otherwise prescribe.17  This consideration is one important reason that the optimal control simulation generates a more accommodative path than the Taylor (1999 ) rule."
" In particular, the FOMC has considerable latitude to withdraw policy accommodation if the economic recovery were to proceed much faster than expect ed or if inflation were to come in higher ."
" In contrast, if the recovery falter ed or inflation drift ed down, the Committee could provide additional stimulus  using its unconventional tools, but doing so involves costs and risks."
"Willams (2000) , “Three Lessons for Monetary Policy in a Low -Inflation Era, ” Journal of Money, Credit, and Banking , vol."
"  - 18 - situation and the limits placed on conventional policy by t he zero lower bound on interest rates, these issues of risk management take on special importance."
" Such rules can serve as useful benchmarks for facilitating monetary policy deliberations and communications, but a dose of good judgment will always be essential as well."
  Uncertainty and Policy Conditionality  The policy prescriptions I’ve discussed thus far are  conditioned on a n illustrative  baseline forecast for unemployment and inflation.
" Figure 9 shows one scenario  in which  the recovery turns out to be unexpectedly strong, with the unemployment rate reaching 6 percent by the end of 2014  and inflation moving a little above 2 percent  later in the decade ."
" It also shows a second scenario in which the recovery is unexpected ly weak, with the  unemployment rate remain ing above 8 percent until early 2014 ."
" In this scenario , inflation  stays persistently below 2 percent."
" In particular, we know that recoveries from financial crises are commonly prolonge d, and I remain concerned that the headwinds that have been restraining the recovery could lead to  a longer period of sluggish growth and high unemployment than is embodied in the consensus forecasts ."
 Such developments would likely have substantial adverse effects on U.S. economic activity and inflation .
" As I noted, the decline we’ve seen in the unemployment rate could conceivably indicate that GDP has been rising significantly faster than now estimated."
" Alternatively, the   - 20 - economy’s productive potential could be less than I judge, in which case  inflationary pressures could  emerge sooner than I expect.18  Conclusion  In summary, I expect the economic recovery to continue --indeed, to strengthen somewhat over time ."
" Even so, over the next several years, I anticipate that we will fall far short in achieving our maximum employment objective , and I expect inflation to remain at or below the FOMC’s long errun goal of 2 percent."
" Such a shock would have ambiguous implications for monetary policy because, on the one hand, the contractionary effect of higher oil prices on output and unemployment argues for greater accommodation, while, on the other hand, the upward effect on inflation would argue for less."
" In my view, as long as inflation expectations remain well anchored, then any higher inflation would be transitory --as proved to be the case last year --and the appropriate balance in fulfilling our dual mandate would likely imply little change in the path of short -term nominal rates, in part because such a policy response would cause real interest rates to be somewhat lower for a time and thereby provide additional policy accommodation."
" Once again, then,  the role of inflation expectations remains of central importance to the proper stance of policy."
