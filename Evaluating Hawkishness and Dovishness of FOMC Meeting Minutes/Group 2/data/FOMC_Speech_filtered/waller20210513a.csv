"For r elease on delivery  1:00 p.m. EDT  May 13, 2021         The Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy     Remarks by   Christopher J."
 I  am with you to talk about my  outlook for the U.S. economy and the implications for monetary policy.1  In the last week we have received employment and infl ation reports that have garnered a lot of attention.
" Let’s remember, and this applies to latest inflation data too, that a month does not make a trend —the trend for the economy is excellent."
" My second message is that , despite the  unexpectedly high CPI inflation report yesterday, the factors putting upward pressure on inflation are temporary, and an accommodative monetary policy continue s to have an important role to play i n supporting the recovery."
  The pandemic and resulting publ ic health response led to t he sharpest drop in employment and output the United States has likely ever experienced—22 million jobs lost in eight weeks  and an a nnualized  decline of 30 percent i n real gross domestic output for the second quarter  of 2020.
" But thanks to the rapid development of vaccines and aggressive fiscal and monetary policy, the economy i s recover ing much faster than anyone expected  six months ago."
" The initial estimate of first quarter real gross domestic product (GDP) growth came in at a 6.4 percent annual rate,  surpassing  the level of output in the first quarter of 2020, before the full force of COVID -19 hit the economy."
" S econd -quarter growth is likely to be as much as 8 percent , and the prospects are good that GDP  will be close to trend out put by the end of 2021."
 Surveys of purchasing managers point to continued solid growth in both manufacturing and business services .
"  Employment , as I said,  is still below where it was in February 2020,  by 8 million jobs."
"  The u nemployment rate is still 2.5 percentage points higher than it was in February 2020, and we know that it is even worse for some groups —nearly 10 percent  for Black workers and nearly 8 percent  for Hispanic s."
 The employment -topopulation ratio continues to be depressed from Febr uary 2020.
" This chart , like  the disappointing jobs report for April, shines a light on a  current puzzle characterizing the U.S. labor market —a lot of job openings , but high unemployment rates and a low labor force participation rate."
" When the pandemic hit, both labor demand and labor supply fell dramatically."
" Constraints on labor supply included those related to COVID -19, childcare, and unemployment benefits .”   - 4 - fiscal and monetary stimulus ca used consumer demand to recover sharply."
" This  situation , in turn , caused labor demand to rebound quickly, particularly in goods -producing industries."
" However, due to factors like  continued fears of the virus, the enhanced unemployment insurance, child -care issues, and early retirements, labor supply has not rebounded in the same fashion , which led to a situation with excess demand for labor and upward pressure on wages.4  And that  is exactly wha t we saw in the April jobs report ."
" Finally, the enhanced unemployment benefits passed in response to the pandemic expire in September , and research has shown repeatedly that the job -finding rate spike s as unemployment benefits run out.5  Thus, while labor demand is currently out running labor supply, supply should catch up soon."
" It was a surprise, but a look at its causes doesn’t alter my fundamental outlook, which is that the main pressures on inflation are temporary."
" 5 For example see Ioana Marinescu and Daphné Skandalis “Unemployment Insurance and Job Search Behavior”, The Quarterly Journal of Economics, Volume 136, Issue 2 , May 2021, Pages 887 –931,  - 5 -  First, let me address concerns that strong growth threatens to unleash an undesired  escalation in inflation."
 Flexible average inflation targeting means we aim to have  inflation overshoot our 2 percent  longer -run goal  if inflation had been run ning persistently below targ et.
" Given that we missed our inflation target on the low side  consistently  for the past eight  years or so, the FOMC has said  that it will aim to moderately overshoot its inflation target for some period but then have it return to target."
 Our willingness to aim for above -target inflation also means we will not overreact to temporary overshoots of inflation —we need to see inflation  overshoot our  target for some time before we will react.
 An outcomes -based policy stance means that we must  see inflation before we adjust policy —we will not adjust based on forecasts of unacceptably high inflation  as we did in the past .
 Call this the “Doubting Thomas ” approach to monetary policy—we will believe it when we see it .
"We asked to see it, and lo and behold, we are now starting to see inflation exceeding our inflation target ."
" Although inflation is starting to exc eed our  2 percent  target , in my view , this development is largely due to a set of transitory factors  that are occurring all at once ."
"  First, there is what we economists call “base effects,” which is  the simple arithmetic of what happens when the very low inflation readings of the first half of 2020 fall out of our 12month measure of inflation."
" Retail gasoline prices have jumped in some areas due to the disruption of the Colonial Pipeline, but the effect on inflation should be temporary also."
" As households draw down these savings, demand for goods and services will increase, which again will put upward pressure on prices."
" If demand and prices rise for a product, supply will follow , and bottlenecks will dissipate ."
" Finally, the excess demand for labor I described earlier is likely to continue to push wages up in the next couple of months."
 I expect that all of these factors will cause inflation to overshoot our 2  percent longer -run goal in 2021.
" But they will not lead to sustained , high rates of inflation."
"  - 7 - Financial markets seem to think the same —5year breakeven inflation expectations are around 2.5 percent , and 5year, 5year-forward measures are around 2 percent , when adjusted for the difference between CPI (consumer price index)  and PCE (personal consumption expenditures) inflation rates .6  Hence, markets do not believe the current factors pushing up inflation will last for long."
"For these reasons, I expect that inflation will exceed 2 percent  this year and next year."
" And  in my view, this  fluctuation  is okay— our new framework is designed to tolerate a moderate overshoot of inflation for some time as long as longer -term inflation expectations remain wellanchored at 2  percent ."
"   6 Breakeven inflation expectations are derived from Treasury constant -maturity securities and comparable Treasury inflation -indexed constant -maturity securities , otherwise known as TIPS ( Treasury Inflation -Protect ed Securities )."
 The latest values  imply what market participants expect inflation to be over the stated period  on average.
"  They are based on CPI inflation, whereas the preferred inflation measure for the FOMC is PCE inflation, which tends to run 0.3 percenta ge point below CPI on average."
"  - 8 - Before I turn to the implications of all this for monetary policy, a word about the housing market."
" As I said earlier, housing is a bright spot in the economy that is encouraging investment and lifting household wealth, which is all good, but with memories of recent history  in mind, the fast growth in  housing prices in most areas of the United States does bear close watching."
" Prices for lumber and other inputs for housing are skyrocketing, and while that occurrence is  not having a significant effect on inflation, it is limiting the supply of new homes and helping f eed the house price boom."
 Inflation is currently being driven above our 2 percent  inflation target but is expected to return to target in subsequent years as transitory inflation shocks fade.
" Highly accommodative monetary policy , in conjunction with unprecedented fiscal support, has supported a rapid recovery from a unique ly sharp , pandemic -caused   - 9 - recession ."
