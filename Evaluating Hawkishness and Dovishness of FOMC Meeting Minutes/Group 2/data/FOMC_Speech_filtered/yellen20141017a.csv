" But w idening inequality resumed in the recovery, as the stock market re bounded , wage growth and the healing of the labor market have been slow, and the increase  in ho me prices has not fully restore d the housing wealth lost by the large majority of households for which it is their primary asset."
" Indeed, some variation  in outcomes arguably contributes to economic growth because it creates incentives to work hard, get an education, save, invest, and undertake risk ."
" - 5 -  inflation, the average income of the top 5 percent of households grew by 38 percent from 1989 to 2013 , as we can see in figure 2 ."
 9 All SCF income and wealth data prior to the 2013 survey are adjusted for inflation by expressing the values in 2013 dollars.
"   - 6 -  lower than the average wealth of the lower half of families in 1989, adjusted for  inflation ."

"  Figure 8 shows that t he median wealth for families with children in the lower half of the wealth distribution f ell from $ 13,000 in 2007 to $8,000 in 2013, after  adjusting for  inflation , a loss of 40 percent.21  Thes e wealth levels look small  alongside the much higher wealth of the next 45 percent of households with children ."

" Gains in enrollment have stalled since 2010, as has growth in funding, in both cases because of  budget cuts related to the Great Recession."
" These cuts have reduced per -pupil spending in state -funded programs by 12 percent  after inflation , and access to such programs, most of which are limited to lower -income families, varies considerably from state to state and within states, since local funding is often important.25  In 20 10, the United States ranked 28th out of 38 advanced  countries in the share of fouryear-olds enrolled in public or private early childhood education.26 Similarly, the quality and the funding levels of public education at the primary and secondary level s vary widely , and this unevenness limits public education’s  equalizing effect."
" The premium in lifetime earnings because of  higher education has increased over the p ast few decades , reflecting greater demand for college -educated workers."
" For the bottom half  of the distribution, the $20,000 average in business wealth in 2013 was down from $29,000, after adjusting for inflation, in 2007."

"- 17 -  decades , and  the number of new firms declined sharply from 2006 through 2009.40  The latest SCF sh ows that the percentage of the next 45 that own a business has fallen to a 25 -year low, and equity in those businesses, adjusted for inflation, is at its lowest point since the mid -1990s."
"  One reason to be concerned about t he apparent decline in new busine ss formation is that it may serve to depress the pace of productivity, real wage growth , and employment.41  Another reason is  that a slowdown in business formation may threaten what I believe likely has been a significant source of economic opportunity for many families  below the very top in income and wealth."
