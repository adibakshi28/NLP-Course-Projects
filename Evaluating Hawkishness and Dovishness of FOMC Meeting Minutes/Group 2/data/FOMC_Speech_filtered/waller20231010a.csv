"For release on delivery  1:30 p.m. EDT  October 10, 2023          Monetary Policy Analysis and the Development of Federal Reserve Policymaking    Remarks by   Christopher J."
"Waller   Member   Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at  “The Legacy of Bennett McCallum and Lessons for Monetary Policy Today,”  a conference sponsored by  the Mercatus Center at George Mason University   Washington, D.C.        October 10, 2023    It is a pleasure to be here to honor the legacy of Bennett McCallum by discussing his work on monetary policy."
" But, like many of you, most of my exposure to Ben McCallum’s thinking has consisted of reading, and learning from, his writings on monetary policy."
"Ben was an influential researcher who focused on a number of topics that are key to monetary policy, some of them highlighted in today’s panel sessions, including policy rules, instruments, and targets."
"I will cover these issues in the context of  discussing broad developments in U.S. monetary policy over the past quarter -century.1  In doi ng so, I’m motivated by McCallum’s 1999 paper “Recent Developments in Monetary Policy Analysis:  The Roles of Theory and Evidence ,” which was a review of the previous 25 years.2  In my remarks, I’ll first  talk about changes that have taken place since the 1990s in the way in which the FOMC has conducted policy."
" Then I’ll turn to a discussion of monetary policy rules, how Ben thought about them , their u se as an input into policymakers’ decisions , and the choice of instruments and targets in policy rules ."
" - 2 - Developments in M onetary P olicy from 1998 to 2023 McCallum’s review , which was largely written in 1998, contrasted monetary policy analysis in 1973 and 1998."
" In 1973, many ec onomies were adjusting to the demise of the  Bretton Woods  international monetary s ystem, and their domestic monetary policy regimes were starting to develop alongside floating exchange rates  as well as the first  oil shock that materialized during that year."
" In the U .S., continued dissatisfaction with economic performance— particularly h igh inflation —led to the restrictive monetary policy implemented by Paul Volcker from 1979 to 1982."
 The disinflation delivered by this policy was followed by greatly improved overall economic performance in the period that came to be known as the Great Mo deration.
" The Great Moderation was also associated, in the era of Alan Greenspan’s leadership of the Federal Reserve, with inflation moving down further, to rates consistent with price stability."
"Consequently, by the time of McCallum’s 1998 retrospective, U.S. monetary policy had established a track  record that was held in very high regard."
 It was widely believed that the Fed had lost credibility in the 1970s in terms of its willingness to fight inflation .
" Following the Volcker disinflation, economic research focused on the idea that monetary policy strategies  would be fully effective  only if they were credible."
 This idea led to a n intensified  debate about “rules versus discretion.”  The issue was how to maintain the basis for U.S. monetary policy that Volcker had created.
" In the 25 years since 1998, th ere have been numerous changes in U.S. monetary policy arrangements ."
" Then, in January 2012, the FOMC issued a Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy —also known as our consensus statement."
" From its inception, it made the price -stability goal that is part of our c ongressional mandate more concrete by indicat ing that Federal Reserve policymakers interpret it as a 2 percent longer -run inflation rate  (in the personal consumption expenditures  price index) ."
" As many observers have noted over the years, the introduction of the 2 percent inflation objective and other formalizations of the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy framework actually took place well after disinflation had been achieved under Volcker and consolidated under Greenspan."
 The answer lies in the fact that a well -understood monetary policy regime  is needed to make price stability and anchored inflation expectations  durable  features  of the econom ic environment .3  Communicating key characteristics  of the regime —including the numerical inflation target and policymakers’ reaction function—makes it concrete and transparent in the eyes of the general public while also  enhanc ing the central bank’s credibility and th e effectiveness of monetary policy.
"In this connection, the design of modern central bank policy regimes has drawn importantly on the literature on monetary policy rules."
" It is no coincidence that the period in the 1990s and 2000s of major strides  in cent ral bank transparency, frameworks, and communications took place alongside a resurgence of  interest in research on monetary policy rules."
 The literature on monetary policy rules and on inflation targeting provided insights about how the U.S. monetary poli cy framework could achieve our dual -mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices.
" By setting out a longrun inflation goal, while indicating that we take  3 Paul Volcker essentially recognized this point in c ongressional testimony of July 22, 1980, when he observed that “we want to have a firm monetary standard ."
" - 5 - maximum employment as a long -term variable largely determined by nonmonetary factors, we make clear that we do not view our mandate as licensing us to seek unsustainably high levels of real output through bouts of loose monetary policy."
" As the literature on time consistency shows, not only would such mone tary policy looseness sacrifice the achievement of long -run price stability, it would also not even deliver higher output in the long run.4  Ben McCallum on ce summarized the consensus as follows:  “The pragmatic argument for inflation targeting begins wit h the proposition that, from a longrun (i.e., steady state) perspective, monetary policy has a dominating influence on an economy’s (average) inflation rate and a negligible influence on its rate of unemployment or output relative to capacity."
" When the FOMC began raising the federal funds rate in March 2022 to tame inflation, it used forward guidance to make clear our intention to reach a policy stance that is sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation back to 2 percent."
" As already indicated, the advent of explicit inflation targeting in several countries helped motivate the change s made to the Federal Reserve’s policy arrangements ."
 But the adoption of inflation targeting abroad was itself partly driven by the analytical considerations that I am highlighting.
" For discussions of how the early practice of inflation targeting in various countries incorporated these considerations , see, for example,  King (1997), Bernanke, Laub ach, Mishkin, and Posen (1999), and Svensson (1999)."
"  - 6 - policy instrument —the federal funds rate—to inflation and other key variables, such as data on labor market conditions."
 McCallum became interested in policy rules at a time when those  rules were closely associated with what is termed “nonactivist ” policymaking—defined as approaches that did not involve the monetary authority responding to fluctuations in real variables such as output and employment.
" At that time, the research literatu re focused on what was known as the k  percent rule, implying a fixed rate of growth for the money supply."
" This rule was intended to pin down the longer -run inflation rate, but it precluded monetary policy responses to the state of the business cycle."
" In contrast, McCallum, as well as other economists of his generation such as Stanley Fischer and John Taylor, argued that it was appropriate to consider both nonactivist policy rules  and rules that were deliberately countercyclical or activist .6  A policy rule, according to this view, could respond to movements in output, employment, and inflation in a systematic way, using a formula intended to be applicable over time and in different circumstances.7  Today it is widely accepted by economists that monetary  policy rules can be activist rules."
" A second, related message of McCallum’s work was that different rule specifications can concretely characterize differences among economists on appropriate monetary policy."
" McCallum opposed this dichotomy and observed, “To me it seems quite clear that debates between eco nomists —for example, Milton Friedman and James Tobin—are about the desirability of different policy rules.”8  That is, McCallum wanted to represent alternative perspectives on monetary policy as different rule specifications, and he urged the study of rul es as a means of understanding various policy prescriptions and their consequences for the economy."
" Indeed, the  box on monetary policy r ules that regularly appears in the Federal Reserve Board’s Monetary Policy Report  provides a menu of policy rules designed to reflect a variety of views about the appropriate formulation of monetary policy.9  Similarly, multiple rule prescriptions and the possible implicatio ns of alternative rules for economic outcomes have , for many years , been a regular part of the briefing materials that go to policymakers before each FOMC meeting , allowing  policymakers to  incorporate the se prescriptions  into their thinking and discussions .10 A third message of McCallum’s work on rules was that there were merits in actual policy following “rule -like” behavior.11  He recognized that policy rules were not likely to be used literally or mechanically as a means of deciding on monetary policy ac tions."
" 9 See, most recently,  the box “ Monetary Policy Rules in the Current Environment ” in Board of Governors (2023, pp."
 My discussion of these features will underline the fact that it is today widely accepted that the predictability of  policymakers’ reaction function strengthens the stabilizing properties of monetary policy.
"The M onetary P olicy Instrument  As McCallum observed, “Taylor’s paper (1993) succeeded brilliantly in interesting central bankers in the consideration of rule -guided policy making.”14  In particular, Taylor’s article helped bring monetary policy research into better alignment with central bank practice in putting the focus squarely on interest  rate rules."
 Much monetary policy analysis in academia had considered rules in which the poli cy instrument was a monetary or reserves aggregate.
" On the one hand, the rule that McCallum himself advanced in a number of papers in the 1980s and 1990s was a  rule for the monetary base and was designed to improve on the k  percent monetary -growth rule by introducing countercyclical responses and allowing for shifts in money demand.15  But, on the other hand, he also produced fundamental analytical work showing that interest  rate rules were viable, with his 1981 paper establishing that such rules could provide an anchor on the economy’s nominal variables.16  Consequently, McCallum was receptive when the Taylor rule became a baseline reaction function in monetary policy analysis."
" Second, interest  rate rules were policy  relevant because these rules were expressed in terms of the short -term interest rate on which central banks actually made decisions."
" As McCal lum put it, “ The fact is that actual  central banks in industrial countries conduct monetary policy in a manner  that is much more accurately depicted by writing [the interest rate] as the instrument .”17  Reflecting this reality, all the rules considered in our Monetary Policy Report  are interest  rate rules.18  15 See, for example, McCallum (1987 , 1993, 1999a )."
"18 In addition, interest rate rules, largely consisting of variants of the Taylor rule, have been found useful in characterizing earlier eras of U.S. monetary policy."
  - 10 - Monetary P olicy T argets  An additional attraction of the Taylor rule is that the right -handside variables correspond closely to economic variables for which central banks have targets:  inflation and an  estimate of the state of real aggregate demand or labor market conditions.
" When it comes to the s pecification of the inflation term in a policy rule, i n the U.S. case, it’s important that the inflation target is consistent with our dual mandate, which includes a price -stability goal."
" In 1993, John Taylor suggested that a 2 percent inflation objective characterized the Federal Reserve’s behavior in the early Greenspan years pretty well ."
" In 2012, as I noted earlier, the Committee made a goal of 2 percent inflation its formal interpretation of the price -stability objective."
" Around the world, too, inflationtargeting central banks view 2 percent as the rate corresponding to price stability."
 T he FOMC has further judged that 2 percent is  the inflation goal most consistent with achievement of our dual mandate.
" We have reaffirmed th is numerical  goal repeatedly since 2012, and, in tightening monetary policy since early last year, we’ve made clear that we’re determined  to bring inflation down to 2 perc ent."
"In considering the appropriate monetary policy response needed to return inflation to 2 percent, I find it useful to draw on the findings of the policy rules literature."
 These findings include the  “Taylor principle ” notion that  deviations of inflation from target  - 11 - should likely be met by a more than one -forone response of  the federal funds rate—a response that helps ensure that the real interest rate is increased in policy tightenings .19 The other part of our dual mandate is the goal of maximum employment.
" Reflecting the fact that this goal refers to the labor market rather than economic activity, the interest  rate rules considered in the Monetary Policy Report  put the real target in terms of an unemployment gap, rather than an output gap."
" On the matter of how this rule should be used as an input into policymaking, the main thing that I would stress is that there are multiple dimensions of labor market conditions, as well as considerable uncertainty about the level of maximum employment."
" As a  result, caution is justified in having monetary policy responding to gap estimates."
" I therefore see merit in McCallum’s warning against monetary policy responding strongly to the output gap.20  In this connection, Athanasios Orphanides’ s research suggests that estimates of the first difference of economic slack (or excess demand pressure) may be less vulnerable to mismeasurement than the corresponding estimates of the level.21  These considerations imply that the prescriptions of the firs tdifference interest  rate rule—which also appear in the Monetary Policy Report —serve as a useful crosscheck on the prescriptions of more standard variants of the Taylor rule."
 The Federal Reserve Board website has a discussion of the Taylor principle in the context of “Principles for the Conduct of Monetary Policy” (https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/principles -forthe-conduct -ofmonetary -policy.htm ).
  - 12 - McCallum reviewed monetary policy developments.
" He noted, “ Overall, the most fundamental change since the 1970s has been the assumption of responsibility by central  banks for performance in terms of inflation rates."
"  In 1998, it would be extremely surprising to run across a central  bank statement that discussed medium -term inflation prospects in a manner  suggesting that these are unaffected by monetary policy behavior .”22  That difference between 1973 and 1998 is also an important contrast between 1973, when U.S. monetary policy failed to play the part that it needed to play in restoring price stability, and the FOMC’s behavior over the past two years."
 This is why we have taken forceful steps aimed at reducing inflation —and why we will stay on the job to achieve our objective.
