" It is important to understand the headwinds encountered by the Great Recession generation as they navigated a daunting  job market, and the lessons they have taken from the crisis, particularly with respect to investments in education and housing."
" And it is important to identify  what actions can be taken to improve economic outcomes for the Great Recession generation, as their experiences will powerfully influence not just growth today, but also the contours of opportunity faced by their children."
 Employment and Participation in the Labor Force  Let’s start by considering what it was like to graduate from high school or col lege in June 2009.
" The overall unemployment rate stood at 9.5 percent, and employers  - 2 - slashed 500,000 jobs that month, the 18th  month in a row of job cuts."
" Nearly onefourth of teenagers in the labor for ce were unemployed, and the unemployment rate for people between the ages of 20 and 24 stood at 15.2 percent."
 Young African Americans and Hispanics experienced higher rates of unemployment than their white peers.
 Even these painfully high unemployment rat es--the highest since the early 1980s --understate the damage caused by the Great Recession to young people’s work lives.
" For example,  inflation -adjusted full -time weekly earnings among 19 - to 24year-olds with only a high school diploma fell about 5 percent between 2008 and 2012.1   Of those who have found work, not only are many young people receiving low wages, but also many are worki ng at jobs for which they are overqualified."
"  - 3 - resulted in  the underemployment of others.2  In 2012, roughly 45 percent of college graduates between the ages of 22 and 27 were underemployed, up by one -third  relative to  2001 and the highest underemploy ment rate since the early 1990s.3  Moreover, a recent study by economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York found that  the Great Recession is prolonging the time it takes for a college graduate to settle into a career .4   Recently, the labor market prospects for young people have started to improve , with the unemployment rate for 20to 24 -yearolds falling about one -third relative to its peak and inflationadjusted earnings starting to rise."
" Nevertheless, even with t his recent improvement, there is a risk that the high rates of unemployment, low labor force attachment , and stagnant wages experienced by those who have come of age in the years surrounding the Great Recession may have long -lasting consequences."
" If past studies hold true today, the employment rate of those graduating from college during the Great Recession may recover relatively soon, but their earni ngs may be reduced for up to a decade or longer as this cohort initially secures lower -quality jobs and then only gradually works its way back up to the normal earnings trajectory.5  To the extent that these lost earnings translate into reductions in lifetime resources, they could affect life -cycle spending and investment decisions, topics that I will turn to next."
"                                                  2 See Alicia Sasser Modestino, Daniel Shoag, and Joshua Bal lance (2015), “Upskilling:  Do Employers Demand Greater Skill When Skilled Workers Are Plentiful?” Working Paper Series  1417 (Boston:  Federal Reserve Bank of Boston , January ), www.bostonfed.org/economic/wp/wp2014/wp1417.htm ."
" With skyrocketing youth unemployment and compensation under pressure, the recession sharply reduced the opportunity costs of additional years of schooling.6  For many, these additional educational investments are likely to be beneficial."
" Since the outset of the recession, the annual published tuition at four -year public colleges increased 24 percent, after adjusting for inflation, during a period when real median incomes declined 8 percent.10   This confluence of higher enrollments, higher tuitions, reduced family resources, and uneven job prospects ha s caused outstanding student loan balances to more than double since the start of the Great Recession.11  Moreover, this sharp rise in debt burdens is unevenly distributed across the population, with students from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds  disproportionately likely to use debt to finance education."
 Attendance at for -profit schools increased over 50 percent between 2007 and 2012--far outpacing the 10 per cent growth in enrollments seen over this period at not -forprofit and public institutions.
" This rapid growth, and the fact that for -profit colleges disproportionately attract first -generation college students as well as students relying on debt to fund t heir education, bear s careful scrutiny.18 Overall, the added educational investments made by the Great Recession generation could be a positive legacy of the crisis over the long term."
" The following year, the Congress changed the method for determining Direct Loan interest rates --switching from a rate set by statute to a rate pegged to the 10 -year Treasury note plus a markup."
"  - 9 - 22 percent in 2005, the overall rate of homeownership among young people  fell to 16 percent  in 2014.21 The combination of high educational debt levels and poor job market prospects faced by young adults entering the workforce in the aftermath of the financial crisis are the most likely causes of these sharp declines .22  Indeed, the share of adults under 30 living with parents or other family members rose significantly in the wake of the financial crisis and has remained at a high level.23  The SHED found that , among individuals who live with their extended family or with roommates, over half are doing so to save money, and nearly three -fourths w ould move out on their own if they could afford to do so."
" So it is particularly heartening that, desp ite the challenges of coming of  age in the Great Recession , today’s young adults --including minorities --remain optimistic about their future.30  The challenge for practitioners and the research community is to deliver on this youthful optimism through polic ies and opportunities  that promote strong and equitable economic growth."
The Federal Open Market Committee has been playing an important role by  pursuing policies aimed at achieving maximum employment in the context of price stability.
" Monetary policy has remained accommodative over an extended period, which has supported labor market recovery --with significant improvement in overall unemployment , increases in job openings, and recent declines in underemployment --while inflation has remained below its target."
"  The Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland recently published an analysis of employment and education patterns for non -college -bound workers in the Fourth District’s metropolitan are a as part of  ongoing efforts to improve high school graduation rates and facilitate workforce development in line with local labor market demand.31  Cleveland’s analysis emphasizes the importance of investing in primary and secondary education , as well as t echnical education beyond high school, to ensure high school graduates possess the  strong analytical and soft skills and the guidance t hey need to access technical and serv ice jobs that can provide an onramp to the middle  class."
" - 14 - published Promoting Pathways to Financial Stability , a handbook designed for community college personnel and others interested in helping students learn to manage their financial lives.32 As the economic recovery continues to strengthen , it is important that we monitor the progress of young workers and their experience in  the job market, their educational outcomes, their management of student debt, and their progress toward forming independent households and owning homes."
