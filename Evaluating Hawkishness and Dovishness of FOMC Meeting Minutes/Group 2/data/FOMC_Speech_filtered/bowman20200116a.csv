" If we include the amount families spend on shelter each month as well as the construction of new houses and apartments, housing generate s about 15 cents out of every dollar  of economic activity."
" I’m pleased to say that the U.S. economy is currently in a good place, and the baseline outlook of participants on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is for cont inued moderate growth in gross domestic product (GDP) over the next few years ."
" Unemployment is the lowest it has been in 50  years, and FOMC participants expect it to remain low."
 Inflation has been muted and is expected to rise gradually to the FOMC’s 2 percent objective.
  One of the most remarkable features of the current economic expansion has been the vitality and resilience of the U.S. job market.
" More than 22 million jobs have been created since the low point for employment at the end of the last downturn, and the pace of job gains has been amazingly consistent."
" Let me also add here that, as good as the national numbers for the job market look, things seem even better here in the Kansas City area, where job growt h has been steady and  the unemployment rate has consistently run around 1  percentage point below the national average —at last count , it was 2.8 percent ."
" My colleagues and I at the Federal Reserve pay close attention to developments in the housing sector , in part because it has historically been such an important driver of economic growth."
"  If we look at the growth of  residential fixed investment in periods since World War II that are defined as economic expansions, we see that this broad category has increased at an average rate of around 7 percent per year, faster than the roughly 4 percent pace of GDP growth in those same periods."
" T he strong economy we are experiencing now has an obvious upside for the housing sector:  A robust job market translates into higher incomes, greater confidence, and more people looking to buy a new home or considering whether to make a change from their current home."
" Despite the fact that the Fed slashed interest rates and kept them low for many years, many households were underwater  on their existing mortgages , with more owed on their housing than their homes were worth, while  others  were unable t o obtain a loan to finance a new purchase."
" As a result,  housing demand remained very weak  for an extended period."
"  I should add that  housing activity is also being supported by interest rates that remain quite low by historical standards , with the fixed rate charged on a 30year mortgage now below 4 percent, substantial ly lower than the rates observed just before the last recession."
"  As you well know, activity in the housing sector is highly sensitive to interest rates and other factors that have a powerful effect on the overall cost of owning a home."
"  In addition, amid  the strong job market of  the past few years, we have seen a rise in the rate at which young adults are moving out of their family homes and forming households of their own."
"  Although the effects may evolve slowly, t he higher rate  of household format ion will eventually result in  higher demand for housing and encourage further increases in homebuilding."
" I n all, the national indic ators suggest a positive growth outlook for the housing sector  over  the next several quarters."
" To provide some context, t he national data show that the unemployment rate in the private construction industry is now well below the rate we observed in the early 2000s, a time when the housing market was booming."
" In a ddition, the ratio of job vacancies to unemployment in the construction industry —a measure of labor market  strength —shot up to historic highs at the end of 2018, and it has remained near those levels."
"  I am hopeful that these efforts, along with a continued strong job market, will encourage more people to join—or , in some cases, rejoin —the construction trades."
 I expect construction to continue advancing to meet the underlying expansion in housing demand from population growth and the strong economy.
" In addition, low interest rates  will continue to be  a key factor supporting growth in housing activity."
