" My subject today is one I trust is of interest in this center of global finance —namely , the outlook for the U.S. economy and the implications for monetary policy.1  It has been o ne year and seven  months since the Federal Reserve b egan raising interest rates to rein in inflation, and there has been considerable progress."
" But uncertainties remain, both about the forces that will shape the economic outlook in the coming months and about whether monetary policy has reached a level tha t is sufficiently restrictive to support continued progress toward the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) target of 2 percent inflation."
" Let me share my thinking about what recent economic data can , and in some cases, cannot tell us about the outlook and the appropriate setting for monetary policy."
 The data in the past few months ha s been overwhelmingly positive for both of the FOMC’s goals of maximum employment and stable prices.
"  Economic activity and the labor market have been strong, with what looks like growth well above trend and unemployment near a 50year low."
" Meanwhile, there has been continued, gradual progress in lowering inflation, and moderation in wage growth."
" Either growth moderates, fostering conditions that  1 The views expressed here are my own and not neces sarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee."
"  support continued progress toward our 2 percent inflation objective, or growth doesn’t, possibly undermining that progress."
" This is the scenario broadly reflected in the September Summary of Economic Projections (SEP)  by FOMC participants,  where  an easing in demand helps bring the economy into better balance with supply and allows  inflation to move closer  to our 2 percent objective."
" But I also can’t avoid thinking about the second scenario, where demand and economic activity cont inue at their recent pace, possibly putting persistent upward pressure on inflation and stalling  or even reversing progress toward 2 percent."
" In such a scenario, f ailing to take action in a timely way c arries the considerable risk of undermining what have been fairly stable inflation expectations and possibly unwinding the work that we have done to date."
" Thus, more action would be needed on the policy rate to ensure that inflation moves back to target and expectations remain anchored."
"Before getting into the economic data, let me address the increase in medium - and longerterm interest rates that has occurred since July."
" There are several factors that have been mentioned to explain this movement, including strongerthan- expected  incoming data on third quarter economic activity, an increased focus on U.S. deficits  and the associated  increase in Treasury issuance, as well as geopolitical events and a flight to safety."
" Whatever  the causes, I will be watching how these interest rates evolve in coming months to evaluate their impact on financial conditions and economi c activity."
" Let’s now dig into the recent economic data, starting with those on economic activity that help us get a handle on the strength of demand."
" We ’ll get a first look at the third quarter GDP number next week, but it seems clear that economic activity was substantially higher for July through September  than earlier in the year."
" Thus, we want to be careful and not  pay too much attention to the specific month activity took place but  instead average growth over a couple of quarters to get a clearer picture of the underlying stren gth of the economy."
" On the other hand, if the third  quarter data represent s the beginning of persistently stronger  demand, then we can expect that strength to show up in the fourthquarter data, including by putting upward pressure on prices, which could have ramifications for upcoming decisions on monetary policy."
"  In thinking about these two possibilities, let me tell you how I view two key components of GDP growth this year."
The solid spending in the fac e of tightened monetary policy suggests consumption is likely supported by households’ strong balance sheets as well as confidence in future labor income .
 Manufacturing investment boosted real GDP growth in the first half of the  2 This fact holds for both auto and credit card delinquencies across all levels of the income distribution.
" Recent d ata suggest s this spending is leveling off at a new, higher level : Construction spending growth has flattened out in recent months, and so have new project starts."
" In addition, the  considerably higher interest rates over the past three months can dampen this growth."
" While the previous two job reports had signaled softer job growth, r evisions to those reports added another 100,000 jobs."
" As we tightened policy and put downward pressure on labor demand, this ratio fell to 1.8 at this time last year and is currently 1.5.  In addition, labor force participation has moved up notably this year, particularly among prime -age workers."
" Looking across various measures of labor compensation, t he rate of wage  growth has also moderated, despite an unemployment rate that is near a 50year low."
 These metrics are not yet at their pre -pandemic levels but are moving closer to  levels  that would be  consistent with 2 percent inflation.
     Now let’s talk about inflation.
" As reported a week ago, headline inflation based on the c onsumer p rice index (CPI) was 3.7 percent  in the 12 months through September, down significantly from 8.2 percent the year before."
" Core inflation, excluding energy and food prices, was 4.1 percent , down from 6.7 percent last September."
" We will get an update on personal consumption e xpenditures (P CE) inflation next week , but based on data we received through August, the 12month percent change in PCE inflation was 3.5 percent  and core PCE inflation was 3.9 percent ."
"Focusing on the annualized three -month change in inflation gives a better, albeit noisy, indicator of inflation dynamics ."
 And there are some factors that would be expected to put downward pressure on inflation in the coming months.
 Monetary policy is restrictive.
" Households are spending  the excess saving accumulated during the pandemic and have growing levels of debt, which are likely to moderate spending growth."
 The increase in  medium and longer -term interest rates over the past several months should weigh on both household and business spending.
" But, while core PCE inflation over the last three months has declined to our 2 percent  target, there are  a couple of re asons to be  concern ed that this progress might not continue ."
" I have been concerned since May about a resurgence of housing service s inflation and this number heightens my concern that housing services inflation has not slowed , and may not slow,  to the rate needed to sustain a return to our 2 percent  target."
" Similarly, s upercore inflation, whi ch is core services excluding housing, has continued at a robust monthly rate of about 0.5 percent the past two months ."
" Again, this reading  is not at a level needed to make progress toward our goal and we need to watch and see if these numbers indicate that inflation is reaccelerating."
"  The s econd reason to be concerned is that , while there is some basis for  expect ing that inflation will continue to fall, let me remind you , as I have done repeatedly, that we have seen a string of good inflation reports evaporate multiple times in the recent past."
 So I will be watching the next several reports for clearer indications that inflation is on a trajectory to 2 percent.
 What does that mean for monetary policy?
" But if the real economy continues showing underlying strength and inflation appears to s tabilize or reaccelerate, more policy tightening is likely needed despite the recent run up in longer term rates."
" So I will be watching to see if core inflation come s in higher than expected, perhaps sustained by continued strength in spending and investment  or, if demand and the real economy slow, moderating core inflation."
 My views on the appropriate path for policy will be based on a careful assessment of incoming data and financial market developments and a judgement about whether we are continuing on a path of sustained progress toward 2 percent inflation.
