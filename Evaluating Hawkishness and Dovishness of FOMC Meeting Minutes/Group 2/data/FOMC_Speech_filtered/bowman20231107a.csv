" Before I dig a bit deeper into these questions and we turn to our conversation, I’d like to offer a few thoughts on the economy and monetary policy."
"  - 2 - tightening monetary policy over the past year and a half to reduce inflation, at ou r November meeting, the  Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) voted to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5¼ to 5½ percent  and continued the run off of the Fed’s securities holdings."
"  We have seen considerable progress on lowering inflation, but inflation remains high and recent readings have  been uneven."
" The latest personal consumption expenditure (PCE) inflation index data showed 12month change s in total and core inflation of 3.4 percent  and 3.7 percent , roughly similar to the previous month’s reading."
" However, s ome components of core services inflation have picked up, and I see a continued risk that core  services  inflation  remains  stubbornly persistent ."
" In my view, there is a lso a risk that higher  energy prices could reverse some of the progress made to bring overall inflation  down."
" The economy has remained  strong as the FOMC raised the federal funds rate, and recent data indicate  that economic activity has accelerated  with r eal gross domestic product (GDP) grow ing at a 4.9 percent  annual rate in the third quarter."
 The latest  employment report showed a labor market with healthy  job gains.
" Over the past year, labor force participation has improved with the average pace of job gains slowing somewhat, a sign that labor market supply and demand may be coming into better balance."
"   However, throughout the past few years, we have seen continued data revisions , with the most recent of these revisions reflect ing significant  changes to employment data."
" While I continue to expect that we will need to increase the federal funds rate further to bring inflation down to our 2 percent target in a timely way, I supported the FOMC’s decision last week to hold the target range for the federal funds rate  at the current level  as we continue to assess incoming information and its implications for the outlook."
 We don’t yet know t he effects of tightened financial conditions on economic activity and inflation.
 But I will be closely watching the incoming data as I assess the implications for the economic outlook and the appr opriate  setting of  monetary policy.
     It is important to note  that monetary policy is not on a preset course.
" However, I remain willing to support rais ing the federal funds rate at a future meeting should the incoming data indicate that progress on inflation has stalled or is insufficient to bring inflation to 2 percent in a timely way."
 Returning inflation to the FOMC’s  goal is necessary to achieve a sustainably strong labor market and an economy that works for everyone.

"Ultimately, the net result of this proposal may be to simply shift costs from merchants to bank customers, and to make those costs far less transparent (for example, if those costs are recovered through higher loan interest rates)."
" The lessons learned from supervisory failures during the bank stress in the spring clearly illustrate that bank examiners and bank management should focus on core issues, like credit risk, interest rate risk, a nd liquidity risk."
" But taking our focus away from  potentially more pressing matters, like interest rate and liquidity risk management , could result in supervisors and banks that are less prepared and able to deal with emerging stresses."
