"For release on delivery  2:05 p.m. EDT ( 11:05 a.m.  PDT) June 27, 2024         Brief Remarks on the Economy, Monetary Policy, and Bank Regulation    Remarks by   Michelle W."
" Before shar ing some  thoughts about the current trajectory of  regulatory approvals and bank merger  policy, I will discuss  my views on the economy and monetary policy."
"Update on the Economy and Monetary Policy Outlook  Over the past two years, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has significantly tightened the stance of monetary policy to address high inflation."
"  After seeing considerable progress on slowing inflation last year, we have seen only modest further progress  this year."
" The 12 -month measures of total and core personal consumption expenditures inflation have moved roughly sideways or slightly down since December and remained elevated at 2.7 percent and 2.8 percent, respectively, in April ."
 The consumer price index (CPI) report for May showed 12month core CPI inflation slowing to 3.4 percent from 3.6 percent in April.
" However, w ith average core CPI infla tion this year through May  running at an annualized rate of 3.8 percent, notably above average inflation in the second half of last year, I expect inflation to remain elevated for some time."
"  The recent pickup in inflation in  the first several months of 2024 was  evident across many goods and services categories, suggesting that inflation was temporarily lower in the latter half of last year."
" Inflation has hit lower -income households hardest since food, energy, and housing services price increases far outpaced overall inflation throughout this episode."
Economic activity increased at a strong pace last year but appears to have moderat ed early  this year.
" Firstquarter gross domestic product growth was slower than in the second half of last year , though private domestic final purchases continued to rise at a solid pace ."
 Continued softness in c onsumer spending and weaker housing act ivity early in the second quarter also suggest less momentum in economic activity so far this year .
" Payroll employment continue d to rise at a solid pace in April and May, though slightly slower than in the first quarter , partly reflecting increased immigrant labor supply."
" Despite s ome further rebalancing  between supply and demand, the labor market remains tight."
" T he unemployment rate edged up to 4.0 percent  in May, while the number of job openings relative to unemployed workers declined further to near its pre -pandemic level."
"  At its current setting, our monetary policy stance appears to be restrictive, and I will continue to monitor the incoming data to assess whether monetary policy is sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to our target."
" As I’ve noted recently, my baseline outlook continues to be that inflation will decline further with the policy rate held steady ."
" And should the incoming data indicate that inflation is moving sustainably toward our 2 percent goal, it will eventually become appropriate to gradually lower the federal funds rate to prevent monetary policy from becoming overly restrictive."
" However, we are still not yet at the point where it is appropriate to lower the policy rate, and I continue to see a number of upside risks to inflation."
"  - 3 -  First, much of the progress on inflation last year was due to supplyside improvements, including easing of supply chain constraints; increases in the number of available workers, due in part to immigration; and lower energy prices."
" It is unlikely that further improvements along this margin will continue to lower inflation  going forward, as supply chains have largely normalized, the labor force participation rate has leveled off in recent months below pre -pandemic levels , and an open U.S. i mmigration polic y over the past few years, which added m illions of new immigrants in the U.S., may become more restrictive ."
"  Geopolitical developments could also pose upside risks to inflation, including the risk that spillovers from regional conflicts could disrupt global supply chains, putting additional upward pressure on food, energy, and commodity prices."
" There is also the  risk that the loosening in financial conditions since late last year , reflecting  considerabl e gains in equity valuations, and additional fiscal stimulus could add momentum to demand, stalling any further progress or even causing inflation to reaccelerate."
"   Finally, there is a risk that increased immigration and continued labor market tightness could lead to persistently high core services inflation."
" With labor markets remaining tight, w age growth has been elevated at around or above 4 percent, still higher than the pace consistent with our 2 percent i nflation goal given trend productivity growth."
"  In light of these risks, and the general uncertainty regarding the economic outlook, I will continue to watch the data closely as I assess the appropriate path of monetary policy."
  It is important to note that monetary policy is not on a preset course.
" In my view, we should consider a range of possible scenarios that could unfold when considering how the FOMC’s monetary policy decisions may evolve."
" While the current stance of monetary policy appears to be at a restrictive level, I remain willing to raise the  target range for the federal fund s rate at a future meeting should the incoming data indicate that progress on inflation has stalled or reversed."
 Restoring price stability is essential for achieving maximum employment over the longer run.
" De Novo Bank Formation  I continue to be concerned about the decline in the number of banks in the U.S.  As I have noted in the past, there are several indications that there is an unmet demand for new bank creation demonstrated  by the ongoing preference for “charter strip” acquisitions, the ongoing shift of activities out of the banking system, and the rising demand for bankingas-aservice partnerships.3    2 See Michelle W."
" Many factors influence the pursuit of de novo bank charters, including the interest rate environment, business opportunities, the intense competition for qualified bank management and staff, and potentially less onerous alternatives for financial services to be provided outside of the regulated banking system."
 They may choose to pursue  M&A to remain competitive with larger peers who can achieve growth organically through sheer scale.
" T here is ample evidence that undermine s this argument, includi ng the resource demands on institutions pursuing M&A activity  and the extended  time it takes to complete the regulatory review and approval process  (and the not insignificant failure rate we see represented in withdrawn applications) ."
" This inefficiency limits  activity that ensures  the value  of community banks located in underserved areas , prevent s institutions from pursuing prudent growth strategies, and undermi nes competition by preventing firms from growing to a larger scale, effectively creating a “protected class” of larger institutions."
