"  This speech expands on remarks I made in March to the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, in which I explored  the roles that moneta ry and bank regulatory policy play in reducing the unemployment,  economic marginalization, and financial vulnerability of millions of moderateand lo wincome working Americans."
" These house holds, which had endured 30 years of very sluggish realwage growth, held an unusually  large share of their wealth in housing, much of it financed with debt."
 The recovery has also been hampered by a c ontinuation of longerterm trends that have reduced employment prospects for those at th e lower end of the income distribution and produced weak wage growth.
" As just one example of the broader trend, according to the Congressional Budget Office, between 1979 and 2007, inflationadjusted, pr etax income for a household in the top 1 percent more than doubled, while, in contra st, income for a household in the middle of  - 4 -the income distribution increased less than 20 percent.1  Over these years, the share of pretax income accruing to the top 1 percent of households also doubled, from 10 percent to 20 percent, while the share accruing to the bottom 40 percent fe ll from 13 percent to 10 percent."
  Many have argued that these disparities in income are hindering economic growth through their effects on consumption.
" Intui tively, one might assume that the growing concentration of income at the top could lead to less c onsumer spending and aggregate demand, as wealthier households tend to sa ve more of their additional income than others."
" However, there is no definitive res earch indicating that th ese income disparities show mixed results on the question of whether th ere are stable differences in the marginal propensity to consume across households with different incomes.2  More generally, the evidence is equivocal as to whether there is an empirical rela tionship between higher income inequality and reduced aggregate demand."
" - 5 -income distribution, and the effect of th at variation on aggreg ate consumption--and, ultimately, growth--requires more exploration.3   But since household behavior is surely driven by more than the size of the paycheck coming in the proverbial front door, th e distribution of wea lth--as distinct from the distribution of income--could have cl earer implications fo r the macroeconomy."
" For example, according to the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF), a survey conducte d every three years by the Federal Reserve Board, the top onefifth of families ranked by income owned 72 percent of the total wealth in the economy in 2010, whereas familie s in the bottom onefifth of the income distribution together owned only 3 percent of total wealth in 2010.4     Hence, families with moremodest incomes have much less wealth to cushion themselves against income shocks, such as unemployment."
" Moreover, what wealth lowand middleincome families do have is typically                                                  3 One concern with rising inequality and stagnating wa ges is that lowand middleincome households will turn to credit and wealth extraction to maintain their consumption growth."
" Putting aside the practice, in the runup to the crisis, of le nders steering households to mortgage debt products that were more costly than what su ch households may have otherwise qualified  - 7 -for, one reason may have been that many hous eholds in the middle and lower end of the income distribution, whose wage earnings were  stagnant, did not r ecognize the longrun and persistent trends underlying their lack of income growth.5  If households thought they were merely going through a rough patch, it w ould have been quite reasonable for them to borrow money to smooth through it--to make  home improvements, for example, or to send a child to college.6  At the same time, many people believed that the sharp increases in their home values had made them perman ently richer and that house prices would never turn down, a belief that appears to ha ve been shared by many households in the upper part of the income distribution as well."
" While it is hard to know with any certainty what these individual households  believed at the time, it seems quite plausible to me, as others have argued, that stagna nt wages and rising inequality, in combination with the relaxation of underwriting standards, led to  an increase in the use of credit unsupported by greater income.7                                                    5 In a separate line of inquiry on the social dynamics  of spending, Bertrand and Morse (2013) find that moderateincome households spend more if they live in states with rapid spending growth among highincome households, which suggests another channel for in equality to increase debt."
" In particular, underwater borrowers and heavily indebted hou seholds were left with little collateral, which limited their access to additional credit and their ability to refinance at lower interest rates."

" During recessions, the young, the less educat ed, and minorities are more likely to experience flat or declining wage s, reduced hours, and unemployment.9  While this disparity is not a new phenome non, dealing with a loss in labor income during the most recent recession was a heightened challenge to households that had mortgage obligations and no other forms of wealth to cushion the bl ow."
" Indee d, a rapid downward spiral of tighter credit, declines in asset prices, rising unemployment, and falling demand caused                                                  9 An Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development study by Ahrend, Arnold, and Moeser (2011) documents across a wider range of countries that individuals with low incomes tend to lose the most from adverse macroeconomic shocks."
" In this  case, the effects of the plunge  in net wealth and the jump in unemployment on subsequent spending ha ve been long lasting and lingering."
" - 11 -households will likely aim for something lo wer than before the financial crisis:  Households are probably wo rking toward lower, moremanageable debt service obligations; the heightened uncertainty in th e recession may have raised the desired level of financial buffers; and, to the extent that  households saw the negative shocks to house prices and income as permanent, they are reducing their spending and thus their demand for new borrowing."
" While the process of household deleveraging has affected the spending and borrowing of many households, th ere is no doubt that the process has been more acute for those that have experienced  unemployment, underemployment, or slower wage gains."
"  To make matters worse, there is also so me evidence to suggest that the factors that contributed to the rise in inequality a nd the stagnation of wages in the bottom half of the income distribution, such as technologica l change that favors those with a college education and globalization, ar e still at play in the r ecovery--and perhaps may have accelerated.11  About twothirds of all job losses in the recession were in middlewage occupations--such as manufacturing, skilled construction, and office administration jobs--but these occupations have accounted for less than onefourth of subsequent job growth.12  In contrast, the decline in lowerwage occupati ons--such as retail sales, food service, and                                                  11 The poverty rate has risen sharply since the onset of  the recession, after a decade of relative stability, and it now stands at 15 percent, significantly higher than the average over the past th ree decades."

" However, workers in these jobs often receive less pay and fewer benefits than traditional fulltime or “permanent” workers, are much less likely to  benefit from the protections of labor and employment laws, and often have no real pa thway to upward mobility in the workplace.14  Wage gains have remained more muted th an is typical during a recovery."
" While this phenomenon likely partly reflects the tr ends in job creation that I have already discussed, weak wage growth also reflects th e severe nature of th e crisis:  Typically, those who are laid off during recessions st ruggle to find reemployment that is of comparable quality to their previous job, and research has shown that, on average, a person’s income remains depressed for decad es following job loss, and that income losses over one’s working life ar e especially severe when the job loss occurs during a recession.15                                                     13 These patterns were also observed during the recessions of the early 1990s and early 2000s--the socalled jobless recoveries--but not prior to then."

" - 13 -Indeed, while average wages have conti nued to increase (alb eit slowly) on an annual basis for persons who have remained  employed, the average wage for new hires has declined since 2010.16  Although it is too early to stat e with certainty what the longterm effect of this recession will be on the ea rnings potential of those who lost their jobs, given the severity of the job loss and sluggis hness of the recovery--with nearly 9 million jobs lost and still almost 2½ million jobs below prerecession employment levels--it is very likely that, for many households, future labor earnings will be well below what they had anticipated in the ye ars before the recession."
" The typical macroeconomic analysis focuses on the genera l equilibrium behavior of “representative” households and firms, thereby abstracting from  the consequences of inequality and other heterogeneity across households and instea d focusing on the aggregate measures of spending determinants, including current income, wealth, interest rate s, credit supply, and confidence or pessimism."
Implications for Monetary Policy The arguments that I have laid out suggest  that paying attenti on to the experiences of different types of households may be important for the way we understand and interpret the macroeconomic even ts of the past several years.
"  As a consequence, these differential experiences may also have impli cations for the conduct of  monetary policy."
"  In response to continuing low levels of resource utilization, the FOMC has kept  monetary policy highly accommodative by  - 15 -keeping its primary policy instrument, the fe deral funds rate, at an exceptionally low level; by supplementing this move with forward guidance about the funds rate; and by initiating unconventional policy actions such as  largescale asset pur chases."
" One channel through which these policies operate is by putting downward pressure on longerterm interest rates, thereby encouraging firms to invest in plants and equipment and helping enable households to purchase  cars and other durable goods a nd also to refinance their mortgages."
" The resulting boost to demand leads firms to hire and invest further, strengthening the economy as a whole."
 But accommodative monetary policy that lifts economic activity more genera lly is expected to increase the odds of good outcomes for American families.
" In my view, these effects likely clogged some of the channels through which monetary policy traditionally works."
" As the housing market recovers, though, I think it is possible that accommodative monetary policy could be increasingly potent."
It is my view that understanding the long -run trends in income  and wealth across different households is im portant in understanding the dynamics of the macroeconomy and thus also may be relevant for setting monetary policy to best reach our goals of maximum employment and price stability.
 An d the resulting expansion in employment will likely improve income le vels at the bottom of the distribution.
" There is much work to be done on understanding the ways in which income and wealth inequality and other forms of household heterogeneit y affect aggregate behavior, and the implications for monetary policy."
" The times demand that we continue to analyze such dynamics and their implications, in part nership with academics, our Federal Reserve System colleagues, and policy analysts repr esenting many different types of government and privatesector institutions."
