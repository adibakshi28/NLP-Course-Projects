" I am delighted to be here!   Today, I  would like to discuss the implications of artificial intelligence (AI) for workers and the labor market,  more generally.1  I will discuss AI’s potential to boost productivity, offer a framework to consider which jobs will be most affected by AI, and consider AI’s effect  on aggregate employment."
" I hope this discussion will be informative for many of you in the audience, especially those of you who will be entering the job market in the next few years."
" The unemployment rate was flirting with historic al lows, having fallen to 3.5 percent in the fall of 2019 from an average of 4.7 percent between 2014 and 2019."
 Demand for labor  outpaced supply such that by mid -2022 there were 20 job openings for every 10 unemployed job seekers.
" By early 2023, the unemployment rate fell to 3.4 percent, its lowest level in 60 years."
" In the last year and a half, labor demand has moderated , as restrictive monetary policy helped bring aggregate demand in line with supply and eased inflationary pressure."
" At the same time, labor supply grew rapidly , and now  labor demand and supply are more  balanced ."
" In August, the unemployment rate stood at 4.2 percent, having risen by almost a 1/2 percentage poin t over the past 12 months ."
" As labor demand and supply are now more evenly balanced, it may become more difficult for some individuals to find employment."
  The slowing of the solid labor market has come alongside a significant easing in inflationary pressure.
" Inflation was 2.5 percent over the 12 months ending in July, notably closer to our 2 percent target than a year earlier —when inflation was 3.3 percent —and far below its peak of 7 percent in mid2022."
" In recent months, the upside risks to inflation have diminished, and the downside risks to employment have increased."
" In response to these changing conditions, I whole heartedly supported the decision at l ast week’s Federal Open Market Committee  (FOMC)  meeting to  lower our policy interest rate by 1/2  percentage point ."
" The FOMC , of which I am a member,  is the Federal Reserve’s primary monetary policymaking body."
" That decision reflected growing confidence  that, with an appropriate recalibration of our policy stance, the solid labor market can be maintained in a context of moderate economic growth and inflation continuing to move  sustainably down to our target ."
" The return to balance in the labor market between supply and demand, as well as the ongoing return toward  our inflation target, reflects the normalization of the economy after the dislocations of the pandemic."
" This normalization, particularly of inflation, is quite welcome, as a balance between supply and demand is essential for sustaining a prolonged period of labor -market strength ."
"  Artificial Intelligence  and Productivity  From the outset, I, like most of my economist colleagues studying the economics of innovation and AI closely, acknowledge that the implications of AI are highly uncertain ."
"  The key reason why many expect AI will have a substantial effect  on the economy is , because AI  has the  potential to provide  a large and sustained boost to labor -productivity growth—which is simply how much output of  an individual worker grow s over time."
" Ultimately, growth in output per person, workers’ real earnings, and households’ real purchasing power can all be tied back to growth in labor productivity."
" Like many of the most significant technological innovations of the past 2 00 or so years —such as the steam engine, electricity, computers, and the internet —AI has the potential to affect labor productivity in a plethora  of economic activities across many industries and occupations."
" Although the degree to which these new assistants will improve labor productivity is likely to be quite  idiosyncratic, some early studies suggest the effects could be large."
" If AI can improve our ability to generate new ideas, then it could provide a longterm boost to labor productivity growth, as each newly discovered idea will itself provide an incremental boost to labor producti vity."
"  Judging the Effect of A rtificial Intelligence  on Occupations  Because of their effects on labor productivity, past technological innovations have resulted in dramatic positive and negative shocks to the demand for specific occupations  or tasks ."
" As I think about AI’s implications for employment in any given job or task , I tend to focus on three questions."
"He used it to demonstrate that the shift in labor demand, which began in the 1970s, away from jobs that involved a large degree  of routine tasks can be explained by these jobs’ greater exposure to the rapid adoption of computer ization and automation technologies.4  We can take a similar task -based approach to determine a job’s exposure to AI."
" But even for these jobs, the employment implications are ambiguous and will depend on the third question."
 What is the elasticity of demand?
What is the price elasticity of demand for the output of these jobs that are highly affected by AI?
 Some early studies have found that these AI coding assistants can provide a significant boost to programmers’ productivity.
" One randomized control led trial found that these AI coding assistants cut in half the amount of time it took to finish a small programming project.6  Another study found that programmers who were randomly assigned to use an AI coding assistant submitted 20 percent more requests each week asking to add code they had written to a software project .7  And I emphasize that these tools are still in their infancy, which suggests that the productivity gains for software -programming jobs may be even larger."

   - 9 - These productivity enhancements will allow software programming projects to be delivered in less time and at a lower cost.
" As we know from e conomic theory, as the costs and delivery times for software projects fall, demand for such projects  should increase."
 The number of software -programming jobs will depend on whether the demand for software projects increases more than one for  one with the decrease in cost.
" In other words, is the price  elasticity of demand for software projects greater than one ?"
" If it is, then the reduction in software programmers’ hours devoted to programming tasks that can now be performed by AI will be more than offset by the increase in their hours from the greater demand for AIenhanced software programming."
" While  I mentioned that there will likely be benefits for certain workers , it is important to recognize a universal lesson from past technological innovations —namely , that the employment and earnings of some workers are likely to  be negatively affect ed by these innovations."
 The degree to which AI could negatively affect some workers’ earnings and employment will also be influenced by the pace of AI adoption.
"  - 10 - Implications  of Artificial Intelligence  for Aggregate Employment  In addition to considering AI’s effects on individual workers, economists also evaluate AI’s implications for aggregate employment."
" As I discussed, it remains unclear whether AI will be a boon for  or a drag on net employment for those jobs that are most directly affected by AI."
"  For workers who are not directly exposed to AI but , rather, are users of the output from AI -exposed jobs, the aggregate employment implications are more likely to be positive."
" Generally, these downstream jobs will benefit from the lower input costs that result from greater productivity realized by AIexposed jobs."
 The companies that are then formed to deliver these new products and services can be expected to raise  aggregate employment.
"  If incumbent firms are able to adjust their processes to capture productivity benefits from AI, then these firms could help mitigate some of AI’s potential for job displacement  by internally reallocating affected workers to new roles and providing necessary training."
  - 11 - Individual workers play a limited role in determining how AI will affect their earnings and employment.
