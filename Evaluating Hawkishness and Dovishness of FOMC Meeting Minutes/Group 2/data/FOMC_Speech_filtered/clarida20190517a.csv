"For release on delivery  1:40 p.m. EDT  May 1 7, 2019          The Federal Reserve’s Review of Its Monetary Policy  Strategy , Tools, and Communication  Practices     Remarks by   Richard H."
"Clarida   Vice Chair   Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at  “Fed Listens :  Education, Employment, and Monetary Policy in the Third District ” hosted by  the Federal Reserve Bank of  Philadelphia   Philadelphia, Pennsylvania         May 1 7, 2019    I am pleased to participate in this event , part of the  listening tour that Reserve Banks are hosting around the country  and a key input into the Federal Reserve’s  review  of our monetary policy strateg y, tools, and communication practices .1  We are bring ing open minds  to our review  and are seeking  a broad rang e of perspectives."
"  To us, it simply seems like good institutional practice to engage with a wide range of interested individuals and groups as part of a comprehensive approach to enhanced transparency and accountability.2 President Harker already mentioned t he Federal Reserve ’s statutory goals of maximum employment and price stability ."
 We will also take as given that a 2 percent rate of inflation in the price index for personal consumption expenditures is the operational goal  most consistent with our pricestability mandate.
" That said, based on the experience of other central banks that have undertaken similar reviews, our  review is more likely to produce evolution, not a revolution, in the way we conduct monetary policy ."
"With the U.S. economy operating at or close to our maximumemployment and pricestability  goals , now is an especially opportune time for this review."
  2 Fuhrer and others  (2018) explore the desirability of comprehensive reviews of the monetary policy framework.
"  See Jeffrey Fuhrer, Giovanni Olivei, Eric Rosengren, and Geo ffrey Tootell (2018) ,  “Should the Fed Regularly Evaluate Its Monetary Policy Framework?” paper presented at the Brookings Papers on Economic Activity Conference, Fall, held at the Brookings Institution, Washington, September 13–14, https://www.brookings.edu/wp -content/uploads/2018/09/BPEA_Fall2018_Shouldthe-FedRegularly -Evlauate -itsMonetary -Policy -Framewo rk.pdf ."
" - 2 - unemployment rate is at  a 50year low, and inflation is running close to our 2 percent objective."
 Our monetary policy  review  will have several components.
 Listening ses sions —such as today ’s—give us an opportunity to hear from the people  and communities affected by monetary policy .
" Building on the perspectives we hear and on staff analysis, the F ederal  Open Market Committee  will perform  its own assessment of how it conducts  monetary policy, beginning around the middle of the year."
 What I can say is that any changes to our conduct of monetary policy  that we might make will be aimed solely at improving  our ability to achieve and sustain our dual -mandate objectives in the world we live in today.
