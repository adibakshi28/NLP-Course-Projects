" Real gross domestic product ( GDP ) is estimated to have grown at a mod est rate last quarter , and different data available for the current quarter could be interpreted as suggesting growth is  slowing or even accelerating a bit."
 The consensus of private sector forecasts tracked by the Blue Chip survey is  for annualized growth of only a tenth of a percent or two above zero this quarter .
" By contrast, the Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow projection, based on a range of data, is for a 2.9 percent growth rate ."
" Despite this slowing in activity  from last year , we have a very tight labor market and high inflation."
"  A Very Tight Labor Market  The employment report for April showed solid job growth, but previous months were revised downward by a significant amount ."
" The unemployment rate fell slightly to 3.4 percent, reaching its low in recent years, which is the lowest since 1969."
 Temporary -help employment fell for the third  straight month and is considerably down from last year.
" Some  see this category a s a leading indicator for overall employment, meaning we may see some softening in labor demand going forward."
" This reduction is consistent with a softening in labor demand, but it is still far above the 1 -to 1 ratio that was  typical before the pandemic."
" Finally, the rate at  - 3 - which people are quitting jobs, a sign of confidence in the job market, has fallen and is in hailing distance of the level that persisted for the couple of years before the pandemic  recession."
" As I have ar gued in other speeches, a loosening labor market, to help our fight against inflation, doesn’t have to mean a recession or big job losses .2  But we do need to see more loosening than we have seen to help take the heat off the inflation rate."
 Inflation I s Stubbornly High  Let’s talk about where we are on inflation.
 The latest consumer price index  (CPI) report showed that headline inflation fell from 5  percent year over year in March to 4.9 percent  in April.
  The news on core inflation was  similar.
 Core CPI inflation e xcludes food and energy and is usually a better guide to the underlying trend for prices .
" Likewise, narrower definitions of inflation intended to filter out fluctuations in some prices show  little progress  in the past year."
"Wa ller (20 22), “Responding to High Inflation, with Some Thoughts on a Soft Landing,” speech delivered at the Institute for Monetary and Financial Stability Distinguished Lecture, Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany , May 30 , https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20220530a.htm      - 4 - Reserve System show inflation running between 4 and more than 5 percent over the past year or so.3 Bottom line, I am concerned about the lack of progr ess in any and all of these measures, and I have a couple specific concerns about some important components of inflation."
" First,  core goods prices, which were among the biggest factors that drove the escalation in inflation  the past two year s, aren’t slow ing or retreat ing as much as we need to get inflation down closer to our 2 percent  target."
" A second  concer n is rent  increases, wh ich accounts for most of a category called housing service s and is  a sizable component of inflation."
" Lower rent  increases from lease renewals last year are slowly making their way into the inflation d ata, but most recently, a rebound in the housing market is raising questions about how sustained those lower rent increases will be."
" Last ly, as I think of the service category of inflation, I look to how wages are growing , since labor is a large input into production."
" Though some measures of wage increases have  begun to slow, I am concerned that  inflation won’t be coming  3See Kevin L."
"Kliesen  (2023), “Measures of ‘Trend’ Inflation,” F ederal Reserve Bank of  St. Louis,  Economic Synopses,  April 18, https://doi.org/10.20955/es.2023.7.     - 5 - down very much unless average hourly earnings decelerate from the most recent level of 4.4 percent to a pace a lot closer to 3 percent.4   On Friday, w e will be getting April inflation data based on personal consumption expenditures and then May CPI d ata on the first day of the FOMC meeting."
 These are two critical pieces of data I will be looking at between now and the June FOMC meeting to learn more about inflation dynamics and if we are seeing some easing in inflation pressures.
 E mploying financial stability tools  in response to liquidity pressures  allows us to continue to focus on setting monetary policy to achieve our dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability.
" Monetary policy works in large part by setting the target range for the federal funds rate , and this rate transmits to market interest rates and affects household  and business saving, spending, and investment decisions."
" So, the FOMC has been raising the target range for the federal funds rate over the past year with the goal to slow demand for goods, services and labor to bring them into better alignment with supply and put downward pressure on inflation."
 But wage growth needs to be at levels that are consistent with our two percent inflation goal.
" Othe rwise, wage gains will be outstripped by inflation and families effectively will have less take home pay."
  - 6 - monetary policy developments .
" If lending d oes slow, this can obviate the need for  at least some monetary policy tightening."
 It is important to account for this other form of tightening in setting the stance of monetary policy .
" I am monitoring how credit conditions may be changing, both interest rates and nonrate conditions, such as the number of new loans, the size of loans, and the lending terms."
  Implications for Monetary Policy   - 7 - Let me turn to the implications for monetary policy.
One might lean toward hiking by focusing on the  economic  data and interpreting it to suggest  that inflation and economic activity a re not consistent with  significant and ongoing progress toward  the FOMC’s 2 percent inflation goal .
" Based solely on the data we have in hand as of today, we are not making much progress on inflation."
" If one is sufficiently worried about this downside risk, then prudent risk management would suggest skipping a hike at the June meeting but leaning toward hiking in July based on the incoming inflation data ."
"   - 8 - Lastly, one m ight want to pause hikes  at the June meeting , meaning that the target range is at its terminal rate, if the current stance of policy is thought to be enough to bring inflation down over time ."
" Between policy lags  and possibl e tightening credit conditions, the current stance of monetary policy may be seen , at that point,  as sufficiently  restrictive  to move us toward the dual mandate ."
" From this viewpoint, the policy rate is high enough and we simply need to hold it there to bring inflation down toward our 2  percent target."
 And  I do not support stopping rate hikes  unless we get clear evidence that inflation is moving down towards our 2 percent  objective.
" We will get additional labor market data, with some  information about wages, and additional inflation numbers in the next few weeks that will continue to shape my view on where we stand relative to the FOMC’s dual mandate."
  Fighting inflation continues to be my priority .
" While w e are seeing some tentative signs of cooling in the labor market, I am determined to continue  to use our polic y tools as needed to appropriately bring inflation down to 2 percent."
