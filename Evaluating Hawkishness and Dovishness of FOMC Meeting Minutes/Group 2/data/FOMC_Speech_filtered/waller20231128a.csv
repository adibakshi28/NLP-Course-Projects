"Waller   Member     Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at the  American Enterprise Institute          Washington, D.C.            November 28, 2023     Last month, I gave a speech entitled “Something’s Got to Give .”1  That message  was prompted by the fact that we were observing strong economic growth and employment data in the third quarter, while simultaneously seeing a clear moderation in core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation."
" While this was  good news  for employment growth , the pace of real economic activity seemed inconsistent with continued progress toward the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) goal of 2 percent inflation."
" It seemed clear to me then that something had to give — for inflation to continue falling to our 2  percent target, the economy needed to slow from its torrid third -quarter pace."
" If it did not cool off, then it was likely that progress on inflation would stop or even reverse."
" So, what remained to be seen was whether the economy would cool or inflation would heat up."
" Data for October indicate d an easing in economic activity, and forecasts for the fourth quarter show the kind of moderation that is more in keeping with progress on lowering inflation."
" In addition, a fter watching core PCE inflation  increase  in September from its summer lows , the latest data showed  inflation moving in the right direction in October, albeit gradually."
" While I am encouraged by the early signs of moderating economic activity in the fourth quarter based on the data in hand, inflation is still too high , and it is too early to say wh ether th e slowing we are seeing will be sustained."
 - 2 -  that policy is currently well positioned to slow the economy and get inflation back to 2 percent .
" We’ll find out tomorrow i f that estimate holds up , but growth in the quarter clearly picked up from the first half of 2023, when real GDP grew at a little more than a 2 percent pace."
" Growth in c onsumer spending, which accounts for most of GDP , was strong  in the third quarter ."
Data on economic activity in October indicate that consumer spending is cooling from its pace  in the third quarter.
"  Spending was down on motor vehicles, an interest -sensitive sector , which may be evidence that that the FOMC’s tightening of monetary policy is having some effect."
" Spendin g was also down at gasoline stations, mostly because of a sizable decline in gas prices, often a larger factor for this segment of retail than shifts in demand."
"  But even without  motor vehicles and sales at gas stations, retail sales barely increased in October, which may reflect  a broad -based moderation in demand ."
  Nowcasting models that forecast GDP based on available data are predicting a significant moderation in economic activity in the fourth quarter.
" After the retail sales report  for October , the Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow model is fo recasting a 2.1 percent pace of increase for these three months, nearly identical with the actual growth rate for the first half of the year."
  This volatility  reflects how businesses manage their inventories by building them up and draw ing them down at other times to manage cash flow and anticipate swings in demand .
" A range of estimates  suggest the strike will cut roughly half of a percentage point off the GDP growth rate in the fourth quarter  and then boost GDP in the next quarter around the same amount , so I will tend to look through the strike impact in considering the strength of economic activity."
"  All in all, it seems like output growth is moderating as I had hoped it would, supporting continued progress on inflation."
" Job creation is down this year from the high rates of 2022, and the unemployment rate has risen from a more than 50year low of 3."
" And while 3.9 percent unemployment is h igher than the April low, it is still basically as low as unemployment got during the booming job market of the late 1990s."
" Members of the National Federa tion of Independent Businesses (NFIB) report job vacancies are down significantly from 2022, but stil l at a level that is higher than the late 1990s or any time in the 36 years of the NFIB survey .4  The bottom line here is that the labor market is still fairly tight and I will be watching closely to see whether it continues to moderate in way s that keeps  inflation moving toward 2 percent."
" 4 The surv ey is available on the NFIB’s website at https://www.nfib.com/surveys/small -business -economic -trends/   - 5 -  So, let’s talk about that progress on inflation."
 Consumer price index (CPI) inflation for October was what I want to see.
" For the month, there was no inflation, prices were virtually flat, and unlike earlier moments wh ere improvements were concentrated in some goods and services, the moderation in inflation was broadly distributed."
" Over the pr evious  12 months, CPI inflation was 3."
"2 percent, a dramatic improvement from 2022, when CPI inflation was above 8 percent for mo st of the year."
" For October  alone , a drop in energy prices offset increases in other categories, but the increase that month in core inflation excluding food and energy  was still a modest 0.2 percent ."
" Core CPI inflation was 4 percent over the past 12 months, but a better sense of the recent trend comes from the annualized rate of 3 -month inflation, which for core was 3.4 p ercent in October ."
" As you may know, the FOMC uses another measure of inflation fo r its 2 percent target, based on personal consumption expenditures, and this consistently runs a bit below CPI inflation."
" We’ll get October PCE inflation on November 30, but  a rough estimate based on differences with CPI and the producer price index indic ates that headline PCE inflation was 3 percent  over three  months  and 2.5 percent o ver six months ."
   The question is whether inflation can continue to make progress toward 2 percent.
"  First, housing services inflation , based heavily on rents,  has slowed  from its peak last year, and the lagged effect of moderation in rental prices in the past year should keep this sizable component of inflation at a moderate level.5  Goods prices ha ve contributed a  5 The pace of increase in asking rents and rents on new lease contracts —which do reflect contemporaneous rental market conditions —slowed since  early 2022."
" This moderation has put downward pressure on shelter inflation this year, which should continue going forward."
 - 6 -  lot to the decline in inflation recently and have moderated so much that they probably won’t be contributing much more.
" But services excluding housing, which accounts for about half of PCE  inflation, has not moderated as much as other cat egories, and there will have to be some improvement there for overall inflation to reach 2 percent."
"  Labor costs are a significant share of these service price increases, and the moderation in wage growth I mentioned earlier should help  lower this segment  of inflation."
"  That is also the indication from the Atlanta Fed’s Wage Growth Tracker, which uses household survey data to estimate annual wage increases."
" A broader measure of compensation, the quarterly employment cost index, has improved less dramatically this year."
" This researc h, based on data from the pa yroll company Home base, shows wage pressure continuing to moderate  in a way that is similar to broader measures of wage growth.6 This is encouraging, but it is not enough  evidence  to be sure it will continue."
" Just a couple of months ago, inflation and ec onomic activity bounced back up , and the future was looking less certain."
"  And while it is encouraging to see inflation by the F OMC ’s preferred measure dipping below a 3 percent rate over the last three  or six months,  our target is 2 percent, and policy ne eds to be set a level that moves inflation to 2 percent in  6 See Maximiliano A."

 I will be closely monitoring the pressure on various categories of goods and services prices  in the coming weeks to help me decide if inflation is continuing on its downward path .
Let me turn now to the implications of all this for monetary policy.
" I would start with the point I made at the outset —monetary policy is restrictive, and it is cle arly contributing to the rapid improvement in inflation in the last year."
" The FOMC raised  the federal funds rate from near zero to more than 5 percent, the sharpest increase in more than 40 years, and, as some people have noted, we have seen the most rapid decline in inflation on record."
" Elevated inflation was partly the result of supply -side problems related to the pandemic, and some  of the improvement in inflation that we have seen has been due to the easing of those problems ."
 But most data indicators and anecdotal evidence  suggests that  supply side problems are largely behind us so they will provide little support in the future in returning inflation to our 2  percent  goal.
 Monetary policy will have to do the work from here on out to get inflation back down to 2  percent .
  There has been chatter that robust economic growth and fallin g inflation may be the result of higher labor productivity  growth .
" In fact , productivity growth over the last two quarters has averaged over 4 percent, more than double the long -term rate ."
" However, measures of labor productivity  are very noisy , and for t he 15 quarters since the advent of the pandemic, productivity has increased at an annual rate of 1.4 percent, close to the 1.5 average  over the past 15 years ."
"  So, relying on the productivity growth story to guide the current stance of monetary policy app ears to be premature."
" There has also been a lot of discussion about the overall easing of financial conditions  this month , as reflected in market interest rates  and the prices of other assets ."
" Long -term interest rates are still higher than they were before the middle of the year, and overall financial conditions are tighter, which should be putting downward pressure on household and business spending ."
"  The October data I have cited on economic activity and inflation are consistent with the kind of moderating demand and ea sing price pressure that will help move inflation back to 2 percent, and I will be looking to see that confirmed in upcoming data releases ."
" Before the next FOMC meeting we will get data on PCE inflation and job openings, and a job report and supply manage r’s survey for November."
" CPI inflation will come out on December 12, the first day of the FOMC meeting."
 All of that data will tell us whether inflation and aggregate demand are continuing to move in the right direction and inflation is on a path to our 2  percent goal.
