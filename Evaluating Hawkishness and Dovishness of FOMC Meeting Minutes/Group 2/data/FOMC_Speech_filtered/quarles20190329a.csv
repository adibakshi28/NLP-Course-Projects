"Quarles   Vice Chair  for Supervision  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at  “Strategic Approaches to the Fed’s B alance Sheet and Communications”  Spring 2019 Meeting of the Manhattan Institute’s Shadow Open Market Committee  New York, New  York        March 29, 2019   It is a pleasure to address  the Manhattan Institute’s Shadow Open Market Committee (SOMC) today.1  The SOMC has long served as an important forum for debate regarding the appropriate stance of monetary policy--debates that have often brought alternative perspectives to the challenges facing the Federal  Open Market Committee (FOMC) in the pursuit of  its dual mandate of maximum employment and stable prices ."
" We hoped also to improve policy discussion.”2 This afternoon, I will briefly remark on the economic outlook and the current stance of monetary policy , and I w ould then like to devote some  time to a discussion of  the approach the Federal Reserve has taken on the setting of the countercyclical capital buffer  (CCyB)  and why I see a setting of 0 percent, as recently affirmed by the Board, as the current appropriate setting for the CCyB ."
"  - 2 - of the incoming data in determining the appropriate stance of policy, particularly given some indication that growth has slowed, at least temporarily, in the most recent data."
"  That said, I remain optimistic about the outlook for the U.S. economy, and I think that we have the potential to maintain growth at a healthy pace in the years ahead."
"  With regard to the recent data,  a sharp falloff in some retail sales measures in December  suggested  a slowing of consumption, the mainstay  component of aggregate demand."
" Even with a weak reading in February, the three -month average gain in payrolls, at 186,000, remains above most estimates of the pace of job gains  needed to maintain downward press ure on an already historically low  unemployment rate."
"  Looking past the near -term data, I see many reasons to expect relatively strong growth in the coming years, supported by gains in the productive capacity of the economy."
" A fter a period of subdued growth, i nvest ment was also strong last year , with spending on equipment and intangibles rising 7½ percent, increasing the capital stock and adding to the productive potential of the economy."
" Though some recent  investment indicators have been less robust, these data are volatile ,  - 3 - and I expect continued gains supported by profit growth, continuing impetus from incentives in the tax bill,  and a generally favorable business environment."
"    Most important, I have been encouraged by the recent stepup in labor productivity growth."
 Last year’s increase of almost 2 percent marked the strongest growth since the immediate aftermath of the financial crisis and was well above the 1 percent pace that prevailed in the preceding five years.
 I think there are many reasons to believe that this faster productivity growth could be persistent.
" For another , it could be that tight labor markets have played a role in boosti ng labor productivity growth as employers work to increase efficiency as new workers become harder to find ."
"  Turning to inflation, given the volatility and idiosyncrasies of the data, I view the current reading on core PCE (personal consumption expenditures) inflation, at 1.8 percent, as being roughly consistent with our 2 percent objective ."
" Overall, inflation pressures are muted."
 But I do not  believe that  the seeming  unresponsiveness of inflation to the apparent tightness of the labor market and other aspects of the economy tells the whole story in evaluating slack versus constraint in the economy.
" Of the many explanations  for this phenomenon that have been offered, one possibility that we have to keep in mind is that inflation has remained stable precisely because of the public’s confidence that the Fed will maintain a framework that keeps the economy from overheating and inflation from rising significantly above the 2 percent benchmark."
 Inflation  could then for some time remain quite stable in the face of an economy running hot.
" But if public confidence began to erode because of Fed inaction, a possible consequence could be the de -anchoring of inflation expectations, rather than a gradual  - 4 - and controlled move to an inflation rate sustainably around our 2 percent goal."
" Of course, there are a variety of alternative explanations for the current surprising relationship betwee n inflation and unemployment, and perhaps all of them are part of a full account."
" We  should also be wary of a material and durable downward drift in inflation expectations below our objective , were we to see that develop, perhaps due to secular changes in the formation of prices  or perceived constraints on the ability of monetary policy to react to future downturns."
" Either way, as a matter of prudent risk management, we must conduct policy in a manner consistent with keepi ng inflation near target, validating the public’s trust in our commitment to our inflation objective  and keeping inflation expectations anchored ."
" That said, my sense is that  further increase s in the policy rate may be necessary at some point, a stance I believe is consistent with my optimistic view of the economy’s growth potential and momentum."
" It would probably be clearest if we defined what data we are dependent on and how we depended on those data--that is to say , if we adopted a monetary policy rule."

" According to national authorities’ announcements, the decisions to activate the buffer s were generally motivated by credit growth, household debt, and housing prices ; in this re gard, it is notable that mortgage credit or house prices have expanded rapidly in several countries deploying the CCyB, including Hong Kong and the Nordic countries that have set their CCyB at 2.5  percent ."
  Another possible benefit of a system that has additional flexibility is the ability to coordinate the setting of the CCyB with the  setting of monetary policy in situations where such coordination is valuable.
" At the same time, I would not expect such situations to be the norm, as the objectives and governance of monetary policy and macroprudential  policies are separate for good reas ons."
