"For release on delivery  10:30  a.m. EST March 1 , 2012          Accommodative  Monetary Policy  and Its Effects on Savers     Remarks by   Sarah Bloom  Raskin   Member   Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at the   Y’s Men of Westport   Westport, Connecticut        March 1, 2012    Good morning ."
" So  long as the local high school bands produced a steady stream of French horn  players, Kenneth was assured that his services would be in demand."
" I knew as a kid , however,  that in order to buy a ticket to go to the movies with my friends , I was going to have to number  around 400 pages, a nd if I did more pages than that and invest ed the money in a savings account at a bank at a compounded annual interest rate of 41/2 percent, I could eventually afford to buy some popcorn, too ."
" But if I wanted to cut back the number of pages  and still accumulate enough to go to the movies sometime , I would need to find an interest rate out there for my earnings of three or more times what the bank was offering --not likely for a very young investor  with limited funds."
" I’d like to provide some perspective on the implications of the Federal Reserve ’s current monetary policy stance for savers and, in particular, to explore notions that low interest rates could  be hurting savers and hindering , rather than helping , the recovery."
"  In order to explore this idea, we first need to go back in time and review  the evolution of the economy in the past several years from the perspective of the Federal Reserve, as well as the monetary policy  response to the events that unfolded ."
 Then we can look at the particular effects that the Fed’s monetary policy stance can be having in terms of interest rate  levels .
" The recovery from what has been referred to as the “Great Recession ” officially began in the third quarter of 2009 , but the pace of economic growth since then has been modest relative to the type of cyclical rebound that we had experienced in the prior 60 years."
"  The recession’s toll on households and businesses was enormous:  Between January 2008  and February 2010 , we lost 83/4 million nonfarm payroll jobs and saw the unemployment rate double , from roughly 5 percent to around 10 percent."
" As of January  of this year , we had recovered just over one -third of the payroll jobs we lost, and the unemployment ra te was still elevated at  - 4 - 8.3 percent."
" This unusual weakness in household income and wealth , coupled with impaired access to credit,  has attenuated the normal recovery in consumer demand that typically occur s during an economic upturn."
"  Early last year, consumer price inflation was boosted  by sharp runups in the prices of food and energy , which also worked to damp en household spending ."
" Indeed, inflation, as  measured by the price  index for personal consumption expenditures, moved up from an annual rate of 11/2 percent in 2010 to 31/2 percent  in the first half of last year ."
" The moderation in consumer pric e inflation continued in January, but gasoline prices have been rising again of late, which will likely push up overall inflation in coming months."
" Whether the increase in gasoline prices , and energy prices more broadly,  turns into a persistent  inflation problem depends critically on the evolution of inflation expectations."
" Last year, as actual inflation accelerated and decelerated, survey measures and financial market indicators of inflation expectations remained relatively stable, which limited the infl uence of the price shocks we saw a year  - 5 - ago."
" If, as I expect, inflation expectations remain stable in response to the recent run -up in gasoline prices, their influence on overall inflation should be limited as well ."
" Now that  most of the economic data for late 2011 ha ve arrived, we can see that the pace of economic activity improved over the second half of the year as the drag on spending and production from high  energy prices and temporary supply chain disruptions from the disasters in Japan and Thailand waned."
" In the labor market, employment gains picked up beginning in the fall, and in recent months the unemployment rate has declined noticeably."
" In part, those v iews are likely the result of many having endured extended period s of very high long -term unemployment or having to settle for only part -time work."
" At that rate, the central tendency of our forecasts for the unemployment rate  show s only a small improvement  over the course of this year."
  And inflation is expected to run at or below our 2 percent longer -run goal.
" In addition,  the information on economic activity abroad, particularly in Europe, seemed to be pointing to weaker demand for U.S. exports."
" Monetary Policy  Given the magnitude of the global financial crisis and its aftermath, the Federal Reserve acted to provide unprec edented monetary stimulus to promote and then support an economic recovery."
" Moreover , the FOMC has worked to clarify its forward guidance about the future path of the federal funds rate, conditional on the outlook for economic activity and  - 7 - inflation."
" These  actions were intended to put downward pressure on longer -term interest rates , support mortgage markets,  and, more broadly, help foster financial conditions that would provide more support to economic growth."
" At the January FOMC meeting, w ith our current projection s for economic activity and inflation  in mind, the Committee decided that more accommodative financial conditions  would be appropriate to help bring both inflation and unemployment back, over time, to levels viewed as consistent with the FOMC ’s long errun objectives  mandated by the Congress ."
" The FOMC  judged that economic conditions, including the outlook for low rates of resource utilization and subdued inflation over the medium run , are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate at least through late 2014, more than a year later than it had indicated in the postmeeting statements starting last August."
 The Effects of Monetary Policy on Savers  This extended period of depressed levels of economic activity and low interest rates will continue to have important implications for household income flows.
" In particular, critics of the Federal Reserve’s accommo dative monetary policy are correct that the low level of interest rates represents a strain on households who rely on income  - 8 - from interest -bearing assets; indeed, the flow of interest income that households earn on their savings has declined about onefourth since the recession began."
" However, I would also emphasize that many households are benefiting from the low level of interest rates , and some critics of the Federal Reserve’s accommodative monetary policy seem to minimize  this point ."
" Thus , these re turns should be supported, over time, by the accommodative monetary policy that we have in place."
" Moreover, the Federal Reserve aims to keep inflation low and stable over time, which limits the risk to investors that high inflation will undermine the valu e of their savings."
"   I also want to specifically address the argument raised by critics that an extended period of low interest rates will discourage households from saving and , as a result,  diminish the longer -run economic growth prospects of the U.S. e conomy."
 Raising interest rates now would damp en those incentives.
" Thus, at the moment, channeling households’ savings into the productive resources that will support our longer -term economic growth prospects requires low interest rates, not higher ones."
 I believe that the policy record in recent years clearly demon strates the Federal Reserve’s commitment to act as appropriate to foster maximum employment and price stability.
" The highly accommodative monetary policy now in place is intended to provide the support needed to strengthen the economic expansion and , over time, return  the economy to sustainable rates of output growth, unemployment, and inflation ."
