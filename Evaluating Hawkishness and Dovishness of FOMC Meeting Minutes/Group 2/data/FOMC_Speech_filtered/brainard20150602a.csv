"For release on delivery  10:00 a.m. EDT  June 2, 2015         The U.S. Economic Outlook and Implications for Monetary Policy     Remarks by   Lael Brainard   Member   Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at the   Center for Strategic and International Studies   Washington, D.C.        June 2, 2015    This spring marks the end of the Federal Reserve’s calendar -based forward guidance and the return to full data dependency in the setting of the federal funds rate."
" Indeed, it may be that the dismal estimate by the Bureau of Economic Analysis of the annualized change in firstquarter gross domestic product (GDP) , negative 0.7 percent , is principally an extension of the pattern, seen for several years , of significantly slower measured GDP growth in the first quarter followed by considerably stronger readings duri ng the remainder of the year."
" P rivate -sector  forecast s of second -quarter growth are centered around 21/2 percent , while the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s                                                  I am grat eful to Andrew Figura for his assistance in preparing this text."
"  - 2 - GDPNow forecast, which was quite accurate in its prediction of the first estimate of firstquarter GDP growth, is projecting secondquarter G DP growth of only 0.8 percent.2   Second, it would not be the first time this recovery has proceeded in fits and starts."
"  My own reading is that earlier, more optimistic growth projections may have placed too much weight on the boost to spending from lower energy prices and too little weight on the negative implications for aggregate demand of the significant increase in the foreign exchange value of the dollar and large decline in the price of crude oil."
" Turning first to the expected positive effects, at a time when a lot of the growth burden is riding on U.S. consumers, consumers appear to be disinclined to spend much of the gains from cheaper prices at the pump, preferring, it seems, to strengthen household balance sheets instead."
" For example, the financial crisis may have altered expectations of longer -run income growth and attitudes toward risk such that consume rs may be more cautious about spending gains in income and wealth  that are perceived to be temporary ."
    Modest growth in consumer spending would be significant because strength in other categories of aggregate demand remains elusive.
" Although the data on April housing starts and permits look promising, the current level of single -family housing permits is little changed from the level in the fourth quarter of last year, and average growth in residential investment over the past year and a half has been t epid."
" Given low interest rates and continued job gains, it is puzzling that housing starts have remained far below the trend levels implied by population growth."
" Meanwhile, government spending has contributed very little, on a verage, to GDP growth in recent quarters."
" With the Budget Control Act of 2011 restraining federal outlays and with pension and healthcare obligations limiting expenditures at the state and local level, the public sector is not likely to contribute signif icantly to GDP growth over the next few years."
" Just as the positive effects appear to have been more muted than expected, so , too, the negative effects from the substantial decline in the price of oil and appreciation of the exchange rate on business investment, manufacturing, and exports seem to have been  - 4 - greater than expected."
"  At the same time, the dollar’s rise is reducing net exports , and perhaps restraining investment in areas sensitive to foreign demand, with greater force than anticipated."
Net exports subtr acted 1 percentage point from GDP growth in the fourth quarter and a whopping 1.9 percentage points in the first quarter.
" This large decline likely reflects more than exchange rate appreciation alone, but some drag on net exports from exchange rate appreciation  is likely to persist."
" Indicators, such as the ISM’s nonmanufacturing composite index, suggest that activity has remained solid in the private services sector, which accounts for the bulk of economic activity."
 It is possible that we will soon see the stronger trend in domestic economic activity that was  - 5 - apparent in the second half of last year reassert itself.
" Equity prices, longterm interest rates and risk spreads, and exchange rates  show strong reactions to developments abroad, and, in recent months, foreign developments have at times been the dominant factor driving U.S. financial conditions."
" Weak foreign aggregate demand, as well as accompanying accommodative monetary policies in the e uro a rea and Japan,  and diverging expectations  have been key among the factors causing a significant 10 percent appreciation of the dollar since last June."
" To the extent that exchange rate appreciation exerts a tightening force on financial conditions in the United States, it delays the return of U.S. interest rates to more normal levels."
" While trade is a smaller share of the U.S. economy than in many other economies, exchange rate changes of the magnitude seen recently can have large effects on aggregate demand.3  We have already seen a large negative contribution of net exports to U.S. GDP growth in the past two quarters."
" In addition, because some models estimate that exchange rates ’ effect on net  exports can last up to three years, it is possible that the drag from net exports will persist for some time."
" Even before the latest estimate of the first -quarter contribution of net exports to GDP was published, m any privatesector forecasters                                                  3 In addition, an increase over time in import and export shares will increase the effect of exchange rate changes on real GDP even if the expor t and import elasticities have not changed."
   - 6 - (as well as the Congressional Budget Office) expect ed net exports to subtract from GDP growth this year and next.
"Recently, the euro area has seen some encouraging data on retail sales, industrial production, and inflation, auguring well for some sustained improvem ent in aggregate demand within the euro area."
" Nonetheless, there remain risks and uncertainties surrounding foreign growth that could prolong or intensify foreign headwinds going forward."
 This development reflects in part a significant correction in the property market and the shadow banking sector following years of rapid growth.
" After growing at a nearly double -digit rate for more than three  decades, China has reached a transitional phase in which potential output growth is expected to slow in part because of challenging demographics and the transi tion from  heavy  reliance on exports and investment toward greater dependence on household demand."
"  Ultimately, lower interest rates abroad should boost domestic demand in the e uro area and Japan, which could eventually be a net positive for U.S. net expor ts."
" But the  - 7 - most immediate effect appears to be a shift in asset demand toward countries with relatively higher expected interest rates, such as the United States."
" Inflation, Employment, and the Implications for Monetary Policy  Foreign headwinds also appe ar to be affecting U.S. inflation."
" Weak foreign demand appears to be the dominant factor driving recent reductions in the prices of some nonoil commodities and also likely played some role in last year’s decline in oil prices, although changes in supply are likely the more important driver."
  The stronger dollar is also weighing  on U.S. inflation through lower import prices.
" Based on the share of imports in consumption, econometric models imply that fall ing import prices might subtract about 0.3 percentage point from consumer price inflation this year."
" First, to have reasonable confidence that inflation will be on track to reach its target of 2 percent over the medium term, I will be looking closely at a variety of indicators --in particular, signs that core inflation is firming, deflationary pressures from abroad are abating, and both survey - and market -based measures of inflation expectations are stable."
"   - 8 - Despite the deflationary pressures from abroad, the recent data have provided some reassurance that inflation in the U nited S tates is starting to firm."
"  In the face of the long period of weak overall inflation, it is reassuring that survey -based measures of longer -run inflation expectations appear to have remain ed stable."
" In addition, market -based measures of inflation expectations have moved up somewhat in the past few months after several months of dec reases that appeared to have been associated with oil price declines and heightened anxiety about global defla tionary pressures."
" Even so, most indicators of the underlying trend in PCE inflation, such as the 12month change in core PCE prices or the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas’ s 12month trimmed mean PCE inflation rate, are around 1 -1/4 to 11/2 percent, noticeably below the FOMC’s 2 percent target."
"  Second, I will also want to see further improvement in the labor market with solid further employment growth and further evidence of a  narrowing of resource utilization gaps based on various indicat ors, including the unemployment rate, the labor force participation rate, the percentage of employees  who are working part  time for economic reasons, and faster wage growth."
" Average monthly nonfarm payroll employment gains in the past three months were a little under 200,000, down from last year’s pace of 260,000."
" Even so, job gains  - 9 - still appear to be consistent with declining labor market slack, as do indicators such as unemployment insurance claims and job openings, which remain robust."
" My judgment is that there is still room for employment and hours worked to grow further, as there ar e other labor market indicators that suggest slack not captured by the unemployment rate."
" Moreover, on balance, aggregate measures of wage growth remain soft and have not significantly strengthened in the past year, suggesting there is remaining slack in the labor market."
"  In addition, although the unemployment rate is now near levels commonly associated with the natural rate of unemployment, there are reasons to think that the natural rate may have declined over the past few years such that a gap remains between the unemployment rate  and its natural rate."
" The composition of the labor force, for example, looks to be shifting toward groups with relatively low levels of unemployment.4  In addition, it may be that a reduction in worker bargaining power or perhaps reduced levels of labor market churning are putting downward pressure on the natural rate.5                                                     4 For more details on the composition of the labor force, s ee Daniel Aaronson, Luojia Hu, Arian Seifoddini, and Daniel G."

" - 10 - With the labor market evidencing additional slack not well captured by the standard unemployment rate and with inflation remaining soft, there may be additional room to support further healing in the labor market, which is appropriate following the deep damage from the Great Recession."
" If continued labor market strengthening is confirmed and inflation readings continue  to improve , liftoff c ould come before the end of the year."
" Just as no previous recovery has proceeded as this one has, so, too, there is no reason to expect monetary policy to follow previous tightening cycles."
" To the extent that the commencement of normalization leads to relatively greater demand for U.S. ass ets, we could see echoes of the so -called conundrum in the period from 2004 to 2005, when rising short -term rates were accompanied by falling forward rates."
" Based on today’s picture of moderate underlying momentum i n the domestic economy and the likelihood of continued crosscurrents from abroad, the process of normalizing monetary policy is likely to be gradual."
" It is also important to remember that the stance of monetary policy will remain highly accommodative even  after the federal funds rate moves off the effective lower bound, because the real federal funds rate will initially still be low and because of  the elevated size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet and the associated downward pressure on long -term rat es."
 This possibilit y argue s for giving the data some more time to confirm further improvement in the labor market and firming of inflation toward our 2 percent target.
