"For release on delivery  8:00 a.m. E ST January 9 , 2020          U.S. Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy     Remarks by   Richard H."
" As some  of you may know, I am a longtime member of the Council  on Foreign Relations  and have attended and participated in many such  events over the past 20 years, al though I will point out that i n my previous visits to the dais , I was in the somewhat less demanding  position of asking the questions  rather than answering them ."
" I am really looking forward to this  conversation, but  I would like first to share  with you some  thoughts about the outlook for the U.S. economy and monetary policy.1 The U.S. economy begins the year 2020 in a good place."
" T he unemployment rate is at a 50 -year low, inflation is close to our 2 percent  objective, gross domestic product growth is solid,  and the Federal Open Market Committee’s  (FOMC ) baseline outlook is for a continuation of this performance in 2020.2  At present , personal consu mption expenditure s (PCE) price inflation is running somewhat below our 2 percent  objective, but we project that , under appropriate monetary policy , inflation will rise gradually to our symmetric 2 percent objective."
" Although the unemployment rate  is at a  50year low , wages are rising broadly in line with productivity growth and underlying inflation."
 We are not seeing any  evidence to date that a strong labor market is putting excessive cost -push pressure on price inflation.
"monetary policy to offset some significant global growth headwinds and global                                                  1 These remarks represent my own views, which do not necessarily represent those of the Federal Reserve Board or the  Federal Open Market Committee."
   - 2 - disinflationary pressu res.
" In 2019, sluggish growth abroad and global  developments  weigh ed on investment, exports, and manufacturing  in the United  States , although there are some indications that headwinds to global growth may be beginning to abate."
 U.S. inflation remains muted.
" Over the 12 months through November , PCE inflation was  running at 1.5 percent, and core PCE inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices  and is a better measure of underlying inflation, was  running at 1.6 percent ."
" Moreover, inflation expectations, those measured by both surveys and market prices, have moved lower and reside at the low end of a range I consider consistent with our pricestability mandate ."
"The shift in the stance of monetary policy  that we undertook in 2019 was, I believe, well timed  and has been  providing support  to the economy and helping to ke ep the U .S."
" I believe that monetary policy is in a good place and should continue to support  sustained growth, a strong labor market , and  inflation running close to our symmetric 2 percent objective ."
" As long as incoming information about the economy remains broadly consistent with this outlook, the current stance of monetary policy likely will remain appropriate."
"   Looking ahead, monetary policy is not on a pre set course ."
" We are  draw ing on these insights as we assess how best to achieve and                                                  3 See the Statement Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation and Balance Sheet Normalization, which is available on the Board’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20190130c.htm ."
