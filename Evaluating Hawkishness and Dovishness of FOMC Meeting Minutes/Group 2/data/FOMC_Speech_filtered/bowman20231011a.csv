" The se risks and vulnerabilities are top of my mind but are by no means exhaustive of those monitored by the Federal Reserve.2  I will then offer some thoughts on how the Federal Reserve, and other financial regulators  and central banks , may be able to address and mitigate these financial system vulnerabilities and  risks so that monetary policymakers are able to continue to pursue their monetary policy mandates."
The recent macroeconomic experience has presented both monetary policy and financial stability challenges for central banks.
" In many economies during the pandemic, s upply chain disruptions coupled with strong demand as economies emerged from pandemic restrictions acted as catalysts push ing inflation up to very high levels."
" Aggregate demand was also supported by accommodative monetary and fiscal policies , which served to bolster the balance sheets of households, businesses, and local governments; increased excess savings; and contributed to very tight labor markets."
 - 2 -  Many central banks facing these dynamics have tightened monetary policy in an effort to bring demand and supply into better balance and to bring inflation back down to their targets .
 We have seen some progress on lowering inflation over that time.
" However, inflation remains well above the FOMC’s 2 percent target."
 This suggests that the policy rate may need to rise further and stay restrictive for some time to return inflation to the FOMC’s goal.
" As they have confronted price stability c hallenges, central banks have also faced new financial stability  risks , with some related to the sizable moves in interest rates in an environment with persistent, elevated inflation ."
" The recent experience has  also highlighted how geopolitical tensions ca n pose  financial stability risks, for example, through greater financial market volatility or, more indirectly, through their possible effects on economic activity and inflation."
"  As a case in point, in recent years, it seemed that many underappreciated interest rate risk and yet , it was  poor management of this risk that created significant disruptions in the financial system this spring."
 The vast majority of U.S. banks are adequately managing their interest rate and credit risk and maintaining prudent capital and liquidity positions.
"While the banking sector is expected to experience higher funding costs and some deposit outflows as a result of tighter monetary policy and higher interest rates, these outcomes can create vulnerabil ities for some banks."
" Banks relying on more expensive deposits and  that also have large holdings of longterm assets like longer -dated loans or securities with low, fixed rates will likely continue to experience a drag on earnings, especially if interest rates stay higher for longer."
" A rising interest rate environment may also erode the credit quality of bank loan portfolios should economic activity and incomes soften, posing an additional source of risk to bank earnings and capital."
"  In the United States, the Federal Reserve’s  recent stress  test of the largest banks ’ capital positions  featured  a scenario  with extreme declines in asset valuations and a steep rise in unemployment."
" Should the economy slow considerably, CRE loan quality could deteriorate a s interest rates stay high or property values soften."
"However, there is still a risk that a decline in property values , reduced rental income cash flows , or other shocks  could impair CRE  portfolios, especially if th ose loans mature and are refinanced at higher interest rates."
" In addition to this risk, i t is also important to monitor the interest rate and funding vulnerabilities of these entities  in the current macroeconomic and interest rate environment ."
 A central bank’s implementation of monetary policy may influence the financial stability risks that are most salient.
" In many jurisdictions, including the United States, financial stability tools separate and distinct from monetary policy tools may be most effective to  mitigate and address financial stability risks ."
" The separation of these tools can allow monetary policy decisionmaking to remain focused on achieving central bank monetary policy goals.5 That said, not all of the financial stability risks and vulnerabilities that I have highlighted require policy changes."
" It must go further to  examine  5 Of course, should a financial stability risk event affect the economy or the economic outlook, for example, through a slowdown in economic activity, monetary pol icymakers m ight take this into account when determining appropriate monetary policy."
" If the supervisor y process  fails to identify and escalate critical risks, or to hold management accountable for known deficiencies, such as excess interest rate risk -taking, this  raises  the potential for supervisory shortcomings , including the ability to anticipat e how the evolving macro -financial landscape can affect a bank’s condition."
 Regulatory actions also have the capacity to depress economic activity through the  reduced av ailability of credit or by limiting the availability of financial products or services.
" Inhibiting innovation in the banking sector could push growth of certain products and services  further into the nonbank sector, leading to much less transparency and potentially greater financial stability risk."
" It is also important to clearly distinguish any temporary central bank asset purchase programs to promote core financial market functioning from monetary policy actions.9 In the banking system, it is also important that tools to support bank liquidity and payments—including discount window operations and Fedw ire® within the Federal Reserve— 7 See, for example, Inter -Agency  Working Group for Treasury Market Surveillance  (IAWG) , Enhancing the Resilience of the U.S. Treasury Market: 2022 Staff Progress Report  (Washington: U.S. Department of the Treasury, November 10, 2022), https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/2022IAWG -Treasury -Report.pdf ; as well as, Darrell Duffie,  “Resilience R edux in the U .S."
"In the Treasury markets, the Federal Reserve should ensure that tools like the standing repurchase agreement (r epo) f acility are available to serve as backstops in money markets to support the effective implementation of monetary policy and smooth market functioning."
 A stable and resilient financial system is essential for the effective transmission of monetary policy and for a healthy economy.
 It is essential that central banks facing high inflation bring inflation back to target.
" Effective supervision and regulation, in turn, will support the effective conduct of monetary policy in achieving central banks’ macroeconomic objectives ."
