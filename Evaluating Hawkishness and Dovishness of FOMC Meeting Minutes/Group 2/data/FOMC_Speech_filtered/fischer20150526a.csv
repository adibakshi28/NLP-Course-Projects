" At the Fed , I face a somewhat different set of responsibilities , and m y lecture today  is on the special challenges that face the Federal Reserve and the global economy  in an increas ingly interconnected world .2   Over the past 50 years, global trade has more than tripled relative to world gross domestic product ( GDP ), and the ratio of total exports to global GDP now stands at about 30 percent --though, interestingly , the rate of growth of global international trade has declined to the level of the growth rate of world GDP since the start of the Great Recession."
" In particular, t he Federal Reserve’s objectives are given by its dual mandate to pursue maximum sustainable employment and price stability , and our policy decisions are targeted to achieve these dual objectives .3  Hence, at first blush, it may seem that there is little need for Fed policymakers to pay attention to developments outside the United States ."
" To  anticipate how these shocks affect  the U.S. economy, the Federal Reserve devote s significant resources to monitoring developments in foreign economies , including emerging market econ omies (EMEs) , which account for an increasingly important share of global growth."
" And  of course,  actions taken by the Federal Reserve influence economic condi tions abroad.4  Because these international effects  in turn spill back on the evolution of the U.S. economy , we cannot make sensible monetary policy choices  without taking  them into account ."
                                                  3 The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has judged that 2 percent inflation in the price of personal consumption expenditures is most consistent over the longer run with the Federal Reserve’s statutory mandate.
International Transmission of Monetary  Policies  The recognition that a change in interest rates in one nation can spill over  to other countrie s dates back at least to the 18th -century writings of David Hume on the international effect of changes in the money supply .5  The standard model s incorporat ing the international transmission of monetary policy  were developed by  Marcus Fleming and Robert Mundell .
" In the Mundell -Fleming framework , as well as in modern development s of the same theme, a shift toward a more accommodative monetary policy in the United States spills over to foreign economies  by causing their interest rates to fall--though typically by less than in the United States --and their currencies to appreciate against the dollar."
" At the same time , international capital flows tend to shift toward foreign economies in response to the ir relatively more attractive interest rate s."
" A decline in U.S. policy rates has a relatively large effe ct on foreign policy rates in economies that opt to limit exchange rate fluctuations, at least for economies with reasonably open capital accounts."
" By contrast, a  central bank in an economy with a freely floating exchange rate might choose to lower its interest rate by a much smaller amount than in the United States if it believes that domestic conditions so warrant ."
" In this case, the  country’s exchange rate would                                                  5 See Hume (1742)."
"    - 4 - appreciate as investors rebalance their portfolios in favor of assets denominated in its currency in response to the higher interest rate differential .6   There is also evidence that monetary policy actions can influence investors’ willingness to hold risky assets , the socalled risk -taking channel .7  Such effects seem  to be most potent when financial conditions are stressed."
" Some EME  critic s argued that U.S.  policy accommodation contributed to a  surge of capital inflows and excessive credit growth  in their economies , creating risks of financial instability ."
 One key implication of the Mundell -Fleming framework is that a central bank can exercise full control over both the exchange rate and the domestic interest rate only when there are significant barriers to the international capital mobility.
" Accordingly, p olicymakers face the constraint of the “impossible trinity,” which states that a country cannot simultaneously have an independent monetary policy, free capital movement , and a fixed exchange rate."
 7  Several recent papers discuss risk -taking channels through which monetary policy influences financial conditions more broadly than the level of safe interest rates.
"  Avdj iev and Tak áts’s (2014) study of crossborder bank lending during the “taper tantrum ” shows a larger pullback for countries with weaker current account balances , and Sahay and others (2014) find that country -specific mark et reactions during this period also were affected by high inflation, weak growth prospects, and relatively low reserves."
"  Of course,  other countries’ monetary polic y announcement s can also leave an imprint on international asset prices , with market reactions to ne w initiatives enacted  by the European Central Bank ( ECB ) one recent example.12  However, event studies tend to find larger international interest rate spillovers for U.S. policy a nnouncement s than for those of other central banks.13                                                    9  See, for example, Bernanke (2010a, 2010b)."
"    - 6 - Earlier studies of the international effects of conventional U.S. monetary policy --namely , changes in the policy rate --have also found significant spillovers to asset prices in other countries.14  Studies that have compared the spillovers of monetary policy  across conventional and unconventional measures generally conclude that the effects on global financial markets are roughly similar.15  Given the relatively fast recovery of many EMEs from the crisis, post -crisis monetary  accommodation in the U nited States  and other advanced economies created policy challenges for many EMEs.16  If they resisted currency appreciation pressures by lowering their policy rates, they risked  over stimulating domestic demand, exacerbating financial excesses, and overheating their economies."
" In the event, EMEs tried to make the best of a difficult set of tradeoffs by allowing some exchange r ate appreciation, partially reducing their interest rates, and in some countries also using capital controls."
"  15  Among studies of spillovers from conventional versus unconventional U.S. monetary policy, Rogers, Scotti, and Wright (20 14) report no significant differences in relative announcement effects on advanced foreign economy  asset prices  and Treasury yields ; Bowman, Londono, and Sapriza  (2014) find similar EME asset price responses ; Takáts and Vela (2014) report mixed results for  EMEs, with a weaker post -2007 relationship in levels  of EME policy rates with U.S. rates but a stronger post -2008 relationship in levels  of five -year yields; and Glick and Leduc (2013) also report similar spillovers to exchange rates."
" The effects of the Bank of England’s quantitative easing program on corporate bond yields and sterling exchange rates are similar to predictions from a model estimated over an earlier period by Joyce, Lasaosa, Stevens, and Tong (2011)."
"    - 7 - I would also argue strongly that U.S. monetary policies were not beggar  thy neighbor policies  in that , on balance , they generally did not drain demand from other economies ."
 Federal Reserve staff analysis finds that an easing of monetary policy in the United States benefits foreign economies from both stronger U.S. activity and improved global financial conditions.
  The “ taper t antrum ” of 2013 We should also expect spillovers when monetary policy is tightened.
"                                                    17 Powell (2013)  notes that EME s with larger current account deficits experienced both greater  depreciations of their currencies and larger increases in their bond yields  in mid -2013, suggesting that, while a  reassessment of U.S. monetary policy may have triggered the retrenchment from  EME  asset s, investor concerns about underlying vulnerabilities appear to have amplified the  reaction s."
"    - 9 - The tightening of U.S. policy will begin only when the U.S. expansion has advanced far enough --when we have seen further improvement in the labor market  and when we are reasonably confident that the inflation rate will rise to  our 2 percent goal.18   The stronger U.S. economy should directly benefit our foreign trading partners by raising the demand for their exports, and perhaps also indirectly, by boosting confidence globally."
" And if foreign growth is weaker than anticipated, the consequences for the U.S. economy  could lead the Fed to remove accommodation more slowly than otherwise."
" Since the 1990s, many EMEs have made remarkable progress i n reducing inflation, improving government debt ratios, building foreign reserves , and better regulating and capitalizing  their banking systems."
" In addition, the development of local -currency debt markets has made EMEs less vulnerable to exchange rate fluctuations."
" To be sure, some EMEs continue to face a wide array of structural and policy challenges, including , prominently, rapid credit growth ."
"  Nevertheless, it could be that some more vulnerable economies, including those that pursue overly rigid exchange rate policies, may find the road to normalization somewhat bumpier."
"The Fed’s Responsibility to the Global E conomy  So far, I have focused on the immediate spillovers of U.S. monetary policy abroad and the feedback of those effe cts to the U.S. economy."
 There is no question that sharp declines  in U.S. output or large deviations of U.S. inflation from its target level would have adverse effects on  the global economy.
" Conversely, strong and stable U.S. growth in the context of inflation close to our policy objective has substantial benefits for the world."
" Thus, as part of o ur efforts to  achiev e our congressionally  mandated objective of maximum sustainable  employment and price stability, the Federal Reserve will also  seek to minimize adverse spillovers and maximize the beneficial effe ct of the U.S. economy on the glob al economy ."
" In the United States, we are working to ensure that our financial institutions and other market participa nts are prepared for the normalization of monetary policy and the return to a world of higher interest rates."
"Concluding Remarks   To summarize and conclude , the Fed’s statutory objectives are defined by its dual mandate to pursue maximum sustainable employment and price stability in the U.S. economy."
