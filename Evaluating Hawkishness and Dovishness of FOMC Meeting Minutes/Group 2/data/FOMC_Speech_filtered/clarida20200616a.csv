"For release at  4:00 p.m. EDT  June 16, 2020         U.S. Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy     Remarks by  Richard H ."
" Current Economic Situation and Outlook  While the coronavirus (COVID -19) pandemic has taken a tragic human toll measured in terms of lives lost and suffering inflicted, the pandemic has also inflicted a heavy toll on the  levels of activity and employment in the U.S. economy,  as a direct result of the necessary public health policies put in place to mitigate and control the spread of the virus ."
" The unemployment rate, which reached a 50year low of 3.5 percent as recently as February of this year, surged to 14.7 percent in April, an  80year high."
" In May, there was a notable rebound in employment and decline in unemployment , and these developments are certainly welcome."
" And, of course, despite the improvements seen in the May jobs report, the unemployment rate , at 13.3 percent, remains historic ally high."
" In my baseline view, while I do believe it will likely take some time for economic activity and the labor market to fully recover from the pandemic shoc k, I do project right now that the economy will resume growth starting in the third quarter."
" In terms of inflation, my projection is for the COVID19 contagion shock to be disinflationary, not inflationary, and the data we are seeing so far are consistent  with this projection."
" For example, core CPI (consumer price inflation) prices fell 0.4 percent in April, the largest monthly decrease since the beginning of the series in 19 57."
" While the COVID19 shock is disrupting both aggregate demand and supply, the net effect, I believe, will be for aggregate demand to decline relative to aggregate supply, both in the near term and over the medium term."
" If so, downward pressure on PCE (personal consumption expenditures) inflation, which was already running somewhat below our 2 percent objective when the downturn began in March, will continue."
" Moreover, I judge that measures of longer -term inflation expectations were, when  the downturn began, at the low end of a range that I consider consistent with our 2 percent inflation objective and, given the likely depth of this downturn, are at risk of falling below that r ange."
 The  - 4 - Federal Reserve has a dual mandate from the Congress to pursue policies that aim to achieve and sustain maximum employment and price stability.
" To me, price  stability requires that inflation expectation s remain well anchored at our 2  percent objective, and I will place a high priority on advocating policies that will be directed at achieving not only m aximum employment, but also well -anchored inflation expectations consistent with our 2 percent objective."
" The Policy Response At the Federal Reser ve, we take our dual -mandate obligations of maximum employment and price stability very seriously, and, since March 3, we have deployed our entire toolkit to provide critical support to the economy during this challenging time."
" In two unscheduled meetings , we voted on March 3 and March 15 to cut the target range for the federal funds rate by a total of 150 basis points to its current range of 0 to 25 basis points.2  In our FOMC statements, we have indicated we expect to maintain the target range at this le vel until we are confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve our maximum -employment and price -stability goals."
" On March 16, we launched a program to purchase Treasury securities and agency mortgage -backed securities in  whatever amounts needed to support smooth market functioning, thereby fostering effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions."
" - 5 - current pace , which should sustain smooth market functioning, thereby fostering effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions."
" The Fed is not authorized to grant money to particular beneficiaries, to meet the payroll expenses of small businesses, or to underwrite the unemployment benefits of displaced workers."
 Direct fiscal support for the economy is thus also  - 8 - essential to sustain economic activity and complement what monetary policy cannot accomplish on its own.
" Depending on the course of the virus and the course of the economy, more support from both fiscal and monetary policy may be called for."
"Concluding Remarks  The coronavirus pandemic poses the most serious threat to maximum employment  and, potentially, to price stability that the United States has faced in our lifetimes."
