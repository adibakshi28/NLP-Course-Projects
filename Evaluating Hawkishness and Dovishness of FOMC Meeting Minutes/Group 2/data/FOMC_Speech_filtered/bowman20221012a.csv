"For release on delivery  6:30 p.m. EDT  October 12, 2022          Forward Guidance as a Monetary Policy Tool:  Considerations for the Current Economic Environment     Remarks by   Michelle  W."
"Bowman   Member   Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at the  Money Marketeers of New York University   New York, New York        October 12, 2022   Thanks to the Money Marketeers for inviting me to share my perspective on the conduct of monetary policy in the current environment of unacceptably high inflation."
" I will focus my remarks today on the use of explicit forward guidance as a tool for monetary policy.1   Before I start, let me briefly discuss near -term monetary policy."
" Inflation is much too high, and I strongly believe that bringing inflation back to our target is a necessary condition for meeting the goals mandated by Congress of price stability and maximum employment on a sustainable basis."
" At this point, for me, it comes down to what the incoming data and other economic information will tell us about the outlook for inflation."
" If we do not see signs that inflation is moving down, my view continues to be that sizable increases in the target range for the federal funds rate should remain on the table."
" To bring inflation down in a consistent and lasting way, the federal funds rate will need to move up to a restrictive level and remain there for some time."
" However, it is not yet clear how high we will need to raise the federal funds rate and how much time will pass before we begin to see inflation moving back down in a consistent and lasting way."
" - 2 - My general point is that inflation is much too high,  and the out look for inflation remains significantly uncertain."
" With this in mind, I will turn to the main topic I’d like to discuss today, which is the potential role that explicit forward guidance can play as a monetary policy tool."
 Forward guidance is official FOMC communication that is intended to signal to the public the likely future path of monetary policy.
" The intent of all forward guidance is to influence the public’s expectations about the FOMC’s future monetary poli cy actions, and in doing so, affect longer -term interest rates and broader financial conditions to help  2 It is important to note that the  dates and ample reserves outcome specified in the Plans for Reducing the Size of the Balance Sheet issued by the FOMC in May 2022 are not considered explicit forw ard guidance in this context."
" Explicit forward guidance, defined here in the case of asset p urchases, entails specifying economic outcomes , such as labor market or inflation conditions, that must be achieved before the Committee would consider altering the pace or other details of its asset purchases."
 - 3 - support a path for inflation and economic activity that would be consistent with accomplishing t the Committee’s price -stability and maximum -employment goals.
"  As you know, over the past 20 years or so the Federal Reserve has increased the transparency and the frequency of its communications with the public, including through more frequent use of forward guidance in describing its monetary policy decisions."
" Let me stress here that I view clear and transparent communication with the public from the Federal Reserve as crucial to enable a better understanding of and to reinforce the effectiveness of our monetary policy actions, all of which help keep us acc ountable to the public."
" Over about the past 10 years, the use of explicit forward guidance has become an integral part of the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy toolkit."
" In fact, explicit forward guidance is generally seen by many as especially helpful wh en use of  the Committee’s main monetary policy tool (changes to the federal funds rate) is constrained."
"  Explicit forward guidance hasn’t always been viewed as a helpful addition to the monetary policy toolkit, particularly before the 2008 financial crisis."
" Another common  3 For a discussion of the evolution of Feder al Reserve officials’ views regarding the use of forward guidance in the period before 2008, see Edw ard Nelson (2021), “ The Emergence of Forward Guidance as a Monetary Policy Tool ,” Finance and Economics Discussio n Series 2021 -033 (Wa shington:  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, May), https://doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2021.033 ."
  A related worry was that if the Committee were too slow to alter its forward guidance —perhaps because it feared an outsized market reaction or a loss of credibility —monetary policy could be more likely to fall behind the curve.
" In this regard, one cost of providing explicit forward guidance would be a loss of the flexibility needed to respond to changes in economic conditions as required by the pursuit of our price -stability and maximumemployment goals."
" On the whole, there was a consensus before the turn of the century that cost -benefi t considerations did not favor the use of explicit forward guidance as a monetary policy tool."
" This could be accomplished in two wa ys—first, through simple changes in the federal funds rate and second, relying on the public to infer any future moves in the policy rate based on their own assessments of the FOMC’s likely policy reactions to develo pments in inflation and economic activity."
"  Over time, Federal Reserve officials began to more seriously consider the possible benefits that forward guidance could provide to the effectiveness of the FOMC’s monetary policy decisions by influencing longer -term interest rates in a way that aided the Committee’s achievement of its statutory price stability and maximum -employment goals."
"  And beginning in 2000, in addit ion to describing the current policy decision, the post -meeting statement contained a paragraph on the “balance of risks” that was meant to indicate how the Committee “ assesses the risks of heightened inflation pressures or economic weakness in the foreseeable future."
" Evidence suggests that the shift toward more transparent communication by the FOMC in the early 2000s, including its use of forward guidance, allowed financial market par ticipants to better anticipate changes in the stance of monetary policy,  which were then reflected in broader financial conditions.6    4 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2000) , “The FOM C Announced Today That It Approved  Modifications to Its Disclosure Procedures at Its December 21 Meeting ,” press release,  Ja nuary 19, https://www.federalreserv e.gov/boarddocs/press/general/2000/20000119/default.htm ."
" The first such “balance of risks” language appeared in the February 2000 post -meeting statement:  “ Against the background of its long -run goals of price stability a nd sustainable economic growth a nd of the information currently available, the Committee believes the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation pressures in the foreseeable future ”; see Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2000), “FOMC Statement and Board Discount Rate Action,” press release, February 2,  https://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/press/general/2000/20000202 ."
" In particular, the statement included the following la nguage:  “The Committee judges that, on balance, the risk of inflation becoming undesirably low is likely to be the predominant concern for the foreseeable future."
"6 Meade  a nd others (2015)  find that, due to FOMC communications , financia l market participants anticipated the 2004 monetary policy tightening in advance, but that in the absence of such communications they did not anticipate the policy tightening that occurred in 1994."
 Explicit forward guidance and largescale asset purchases quickly emerged as the two main new tools  of monetary policy.
"   In a way, explicit forward guidance was seen as providing monetary policy accommo dation when the current setting of the federal funds rate could  not.7  By providing guidance on specific outcomes that would need to be achieved before the FOMC would consider raising the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee could help r educe uncertainty regarding its future policy decisions and keep longer -term interest rates low as the economic recovery progressed.8  In addition, with the risks to the outlook generally seen as tilted to the downside  in the years that followed the finan cial crisis , using explicit forward guidance to signal a “low for longer” policy was not seen as  Reserve System, September 24), https://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/notes/feds -notes/2015/effects -offomc -communications -before -policy -tightening -in1994- and2004 -20150924.html ."
" - 7 - posing significant risks to the Committee’s credibility , because short -term interest rates were generally expected to remain unusually low during those years ."
" In addition, the outcome -based forward guidance employed by the FOMC in the years following the financial crisis explicitly recognized the possibility that inflationary pressures could emerge ."
 It incorporated a version of an “escape clause” in its forward guidance that would prompt a reconsideration of the policy stance should such inflationary pres sures emerge.
" In particular, in its December 2012 statement, the Committee noted that it expected the target range for the federal funds rate to remain at 0 to 1/4 percent for “at least  as long as  the unemployment rate remains above 61/2 percent , inflation  between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half  percentage point above the Committee’s 2 percent longer -run goal, and longer -term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored .”9    Of course, today’s circumstances ar e much different from those we faced during  most of the decade that followed the 2008 financial crisis ."
 I will focus here on two features of our current environment that I see as especially relevant for assessing the role of explicit forward guidance as a monetary policy tool in the current conduct of monetary policy.
" The first is that with inflation unacceptably high and the resulting urgent need to remove monetary policy accommodation, the federal funds rate is no longer near zero."
" The Committee can no w indicate its intended stance of monetary policy through changes  9 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2012), “Federal Reserve Issues FOMC Statement,” press release, December 12, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20121212a.htm ."
" - 8 - to the target range for the federal funds rate—its stated primary tool of monetary policy —rather than relying on more unconventional monetary policy tools, such as forward guidance and balan ce sheet policy, to serve as the main indicators of the stance of monetary policy."
"  The second  is that the outlook for inflation and economic activity is especially uncertain , with significant twosided risks ."
" Gone are the days when the risks to the outlo ok were skewed to the downside, especially with respect to inflation."
" And twosided risks to economic activity are also widely recognized by the public, with press reports of an overheating labor market often featured alongside discussions of high or rising recession risks."
" Given that the federal funds rate is now well above zero, the FOMC can communicate changes in the stance of monetary policy through changes in the target range for the federal funds rate and not rely on explicit forward guidance as it did when the federal funds rate was at the effective lower bound."
" After all, back then, the economy was still weighed down by the after -effects of the 2008 financial crisis, and inflation was running persistently below our 2 percent target."
" Looking back, one might reasonably argue that during that time the Committee’s explicit forward guidance for both the federal funds rate and asset purchases contributed to a situation where the stance of monetary policy remained too accommodative for too long—even as inflation was rising and showing signs of becoming more broad -based than previously thought."
"   As late as November  2021 , our forward guidance still indicated that the Committee inten ded to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent “until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee ’s assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderat ely exceed 2 percent for some time.”10  And we were still purchasing assets at the same pace we had earlier in the year, although we did announce in November 2021 that we would start slowing the pace of our purchases in December.11  With the benefit of  10 This outcome -based forward -guidance la nguage rega rding the target ra nge for the federal funds ra te wa s introduced in the September 2020 FOMC statement ; see Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2020), “Federal Reserve Issues FOMC Statement,” press release, September 16, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20200916a.htm ."
"  11 The December 2020 FOMC statement included forward guidance regarding asset purchases that specified that the Committee would continue its purchases a t the same pace until “substantial further progress has been made tow ard the Committee ’s maximum employment and price stability goals” ; see  - 10 - hindsight, one might ask whether we would have moved sooner to remove monetary policy accommodation if we hadn’t been so explicit about our forward guidance  in prior months —particularly  forward guidance  that had set such a high bar for slowing our asset purchases and starting to raise rates."
" Of course, the fact that some of the data that were directly relevant to our decisionmaking did not accurately reflect the economic conditions prevailing at the time —and which were subsequently revised —likely also led to a delay in the removal of monetary policy accommodation in 2021."
"   More generally, I will note that high uncertainty and two -sided risks to the outlook raise some practical questions for the use of explicit forward guidance in the current monetary policy environment ."
 - 11 - the federal funds rate will need t o remain near zero for a period of time to stimulate growth and when inflationary pressures are expected to be subdued.
" Even in such periods, the Committee should recognize possible risks to a low -forlong monetary policy stance, including upside risks to inflation, and provide escape clauses that would detail the circumstances that would cause the Committee to reevaluate its policy stance."
"    Outside of such  periods, our focus should be on changes in the target range for the federal funds rate—the Committee’s primary tool for implementing monetary policy decisions —in communicating the stance of monetary policy and in providing more qualitative guidance regarding how the Committee will be thinking about its future policy decisions ."
" In the first half of this year, when the Committee began to signal that it would increase the target range for the federal funds rate and that it anticipated tha t “ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate,”  longer -term interest rates rose and financial conditions tightened.12  However, being more explicit in our communications regarding the likely size of the increases in the target range at each future meeting was not helpful during this time , because our decisions depended on the incoming data and its  implications for the outlook."
"           Before I conclude, I will emphasize, again, that, m y reservations about explicit forward guidance  notwiths tanding, I am a strong believer in the role of communication in the conduct of monetary policy."
 Clear and transparent communications with the public reinforce the effectiveness of our monetary policy and keep us accountable to the public.
" Second , as Chair Powell noted recently , we should  acknowledge that the outlook for inflation and economic activity is subject to unusual uncertainty, and that, as a result, we will be making our policy decisions on a meeting -bymeeting basis."
"  Third , we should continue to reiterate that we will remain “highly attentive to inflation risks.”13  This is probably the best and clearest forward guidance we can provide at this point ."
