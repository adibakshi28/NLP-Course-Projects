"For release on delivery  2:30 p.m. EDT  (12:30 p.m. local time)  October  8, 20 19         Data -Dependen t Monetary Policy  in an Evolving Economy     Remarks by  Jerome H."
" We must sort out in real time, as best we can, what the profound changes underway in the economy mean for issues such as the functioning of labor markets, the pace of productivity growth, and the forces driving inflation."
"  Second, with terabytes of data increasingly competing with truckloads of goods in economic importance, what are the best ways to measure output and productivity?"
" Put more provocatively, might the recent productivity slowdown be an art ifact of antiquated measurement?"
" Given our mandate of maximum employment and price stability, this question is at the very core of our work."
 I will discuss how we are using big dat a to improve our grasp of the job market in the face of such revisions.
"  These three quite varied  questions highlight the broad range of issues that  currently  come under the simple heading “ data dependent.”   After exploring them, I will comment briefly on recent developments in money markets and on monetary policy."
" World War I was breaking out in Europe, and over the next four years the war would fuel profound growth and transformation in the U.S. economy.1  But you could not have seen this change in the gross national product data; the Department of Commerce did not publish those until 1942."
"  - 4 - Energy Information Administration project s that this month , for the first time in many decades, the U nited S tates will be a net exporter of oil.5  As monetary policymakers, we closely monitor developments in oil markets because disruptions in these markets have played a role in several U.S. recessions and in the Great Inflation  of the 1960s and 1970s ."
  How S hould We M easure O utput and Productivity?
  Let’s now t urn to the second question of how to best measure output and productivity .
" In 1987, Nobel Prize –winning economist Robert Solow quipped that “ you can see the computer age everywhere but in the product ivity statistics.”6  In the second half of the 1990s, this measurement puzzle was at the heart of monetary policymaking.7  Chairman Alan Greenspan famously argued that the U nited S tates was experiencing the dawn of a new economy, and that  potential and act ual output were  likely understated in official statistics."
" Where others saw capacity constraints and incipient inflation, Greenspan saw a productivity boom that would leave room for very low unemployment without inflation pressures."
" In light of the uncer tainty  it faced , the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)  judged that the appropriate risk -management approach called for refraining from interest rate increases unless and until there were clearer signs of rising inflation."
" Under this policy, unemployment fell near record low s without rising inflation, and later revisions to GDP  measurement  showed appreciably faster productivity growth.8  This episode illustrates a key challenge to making datadependent policy in real time:  Good decisions require good da ta, but the data in hand are seldom as good as we would like."
  - 6 - Productivity is again presenting a puzzle.
"  Official statistics currently show productivity growth slowing significantly in recent years, with the growth in output per hour worked falling from more than 3 percent a  year from 1995 to 2003 to less than half that pace since then.9  Analysts are actively debating three alternative  explanations for this apparent  slowdown:  First, the slowdown may be real and may persist indefinitely as productivity growth returns to more -normal levels after a brief golden age.10  Second, the slowdown may instead be a pause of the sort that often accom panies fundamental technological change , so that productivity gains from recent technology advances will appear over time as society adjusts.11  Third, the slowdown may be overstated, perhaps greatly, because of  measurement issues akin to those at work in t he 1990s.12  At this point, we cannot know which of these views may gain widespread acceptance, and monetary policy will pla y no significant role in how this puzzle is resolved."
" A s in the late 1990s, however, we are carefully assessing the implications of possibly mismeasured  productivity gains ."
" Moreover, productivity growth seem s to have moved up over the past year after a long period at very low levels; we do not know whether that welcome trend will be sustained."
   Recent research suggests that current official statistics may understate productivity growth by missing a significant part  of the growing value we derive from  fast internet connections and smartphones.
 Fernald (2015) suggests 2003 as a break point for the beginning of the productivity slowdown.
"    Researchers have tr ied to answer these questions in various ways.13  For example, Fed research ers have recent ly proposed a novel approach to measuring the value of services consumers derive from  cellphones and other devices  based on the volume of data flowing over those conne ctions .14  Taking their accounting at face value , GDP growth would have been about 1/2 percentage point higher since 2007, which is an appreciable change  and would be very good news ."
" Growth over the previous couple of decades would also  have been about 1/4 percentage point higher as well, implying that  measurement issues of this sort likely account for only part  of the productivity slowdown in current statistics."
Let me now turn from the measurement issues raised by the information age to an issue that has long been at the center of monetary policymaking:  How tight is the labor market?
  Answering this question is central to our outlook for both of our dual -mandate goals of  maximum employment and price stability.
"  Until recently,  the official data showed job gains over the year through March 2019 of about 210,000 a month, which is far higher than necessary to absorb new entrants into the labor force and thus hold the unemployment rate constant."
"  Several years ago, we began a collaboration with the payroll processing firm ADP  to construct a measure of payroll employment from their dat a set, which covers about 20 percent of the nation’s private workforce and is available to us with a roughly one -week delay.15  As described in a recent research paper, we construct ed a measure that provides an independent read on payroll employment that complement s the official statistics.16  While experience is still limited with the new measure, we find promising evidence that it can refine our real -time picture of job gains."
" For example, in the first eight months of 2008, as the Great Recession was getti ng underway, t he official monthly employment data showed total job losses of  about 750,000 ( figure 4)."
" Our new measure, had it been available in 2008, would have be en much closer to the revised data, alerting us that the job situation might be considerably worse than the official data suggested.17 We believe that the new measure may help us better understand job market conditions in real time."
" The preview of the BLS benchmark revision leaves average job gains over the year through March solidly above the pace required to accommodate growth in the workforce over that time, but where we had seen a booming job market, we now see more -moderate growth."
" Of course, the pace of job gains is only one of many job market issues that figure into our assessment of how the economy is performing relative to our maxim umemployment mandate and our assessment of any inflationary  pressures arising in the job market."
" Before wrapping up, I will discuss recent developments in money markets and the current stance of monetary policy."
   Our influence on the financial conditions that affect employment and inflation is indirect.
 The Federal Reserve sets two overnight interest rates :  the interest rate paid on banks’ reserve balances and the  rate on our reverse repurchase agreements.
" Overnight interest rates spiked, and the effective federal funds rate briefly moved above the FOMC’s target range."
" While a range of factors may have contributed to these developments, it is clear that without a sufficient quantity of reserves in the banki ng system, even routine increases in funding pressures can lead to outsized movements in money market interest rates."
" This volatility can impede the effective implementation of monetary policy, and  we are address ing it."
" Consistent with a decision we made in January, our  - 11 - goal is to provide an ample supply of reserves to ensure that control of the federal funds rate and other short -term interest rates is exercised primarily by setting our administered rates and not through frequent market interventions."
" Reserve balances are one among several items on the liability side of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet, and demand for these liabilities —notably, currency in circulation —grows over time."
  I want to emphasize that growth of our balance sheet for reserve  management purposes should in no way be confused with the large -scale asset purchase programs that we deployed after the financial crisis.
" Neither the recent technical issues nor the purchases of Treasury bills we are contemplating  to resolve them should materially affect the stance of monetary policy, to which I now turn."
" Our goal in monetary policy is to promote maximum employment and stable prices, which we interpret as inflation running closely around our symmetric 2 percent objective."
" At present, the jobs and inflation picture s are favorable."
" Many indicators show a historically strong labor  market, with solid job gains, the unemployment rate at halfcentu ry lows, and rising prime -age labor force  participation ."
 Inflation is somewhat below our symmetric 2 percent objective but has been gradually firming over the p ast few months.
" FOMC participa nts continue to see a sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near our symmetric 2 percent objective as most likely."
" Growth around much of the world has weakened over the  past year  and a half, and uncertainties around trade, B rexit, and other issues pose risks to the outlook."
" As those factors have evolved, my colleagues and I have shifted our views about appropriate monetary policy toward a lower path for the federal funds rate and have lowered its  target range by 50 basis points."
"  Taking all that into account, w e will act as appropriate to su pport continued growth, a  strong job market , and inflation moving back to our symmetric 2 percent objective."
