" The Chairman discussed these challenges in his recent speech, saying:  “E stimates of the effects of nontraditional policies on economic activity and inflation ar e uncertain, and the use of nontraditional policies involves costs beyond those generally associated with morestandard policies."
 The point of departure for any analysis of monetary polic y is our dual mandate--to foster maximum employment and price stability.
" Unem ployment remains painfully high, and in my opinion, well above the longrun st ructural rate of unemployment."
" Moreover, smoothing through the ups and downs of incomi ng data, it appears that the economy is growing at a pace such that, absent policy action, progress on reducing unemployment will likely be slow for some time."
" Meanwh ile, inflation is subdued, running at or below our longrun objective of 2 percent, while inflat ion expectations remain well anchored."
"With respect to LSAPs, my belief--which echoes the views expressed by Chairman Bernanke at Jackson Hole--is th at past rounds of LSAPs have played a significant role in suppor ting economic activity and in  preventing a worrisome undershoot of the Committee’s infl ation objective."
" And a change in this guidance was a key part  of the September FOMC statement, with the Committee stating that “a highly accomm odative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time af ter the economic recovery strengthens.”  I believe that the LSAP component of the stat ement helped bolster th e credibility  of the forward guidance component by pairing a declar ation about future intentions with an immediate and concrete set of  actions."
" Away from the zero lower bound, conventi onal monetary policy is t hought to work via an expectations channel; when the Fed cuts the federal funds rate, longterm rates also fall, primarily because expectations regarding future shortterm rates shift down."
" By contrast, a principal motive for doing LSAPs is to in fluence interest ra tes not just through expectations, but via supplyand-demand eff ects in the longterm bond market."
" For example, in the Board staff’s main  model, FRB/US, a fall in the long rate is assumed to have the same effect on economic activity irrespec tive of whether this fall comes from the term premium or from expectations of future short rates."
" In so doing, it is helpful to clarify the specifics of the supplydemand story."
" One version of this story works through the market price of duration risk, which is the interest rate risk borne by an investor  in longterm bonds."
 A simple way to proceed would be to plug this 20 basis point change into one of our econometric mode ls and ask what the consequences are for gross domestic product growth and unemployment .
" As a concrete case, if you did this exercise  with the Fed’s workhorse FRB/US model, it would tell you that the $500 billion LSAP should bring down the unemployment rate by approximately twotenths of a percentage point at a twoyear horizon.8  This effect is economically meaningful."
" As noted earlier, the data make clear that past rounds of LSAPs have pushed down interest rates and term prem iums."
" Su ch patterns are what one would expect in a world of segmented markets and negative term premiums.12 This caveat about the diminishing effectiv eness of LSAPs can be thought of as a specific version of Goodhart’s law.13  It may be that under normal circumstances, changes in 10year rates have significan t explanatory power for economic activity, perhaps because they are a proxy for the expect ed future path of short rates or other aspects of financial conditions."
" As to whether we will, the Federal Reserve has repeatedly made clear its commitment to both sides of its ma ndate--to price stability as well as to maximum employment."
" First, this methodology may only provide a lower bound on the welfar e costs of an LSAP, as it is plausible that not just Treasury securities, but also agency securitie s and perhaps highly rated corporate bonds, also have some degree of moneyness to them in terms of being useful in satisfying safehaven demands."
 I am hopeful that these actions by the Federal Reserve wi ll help to give economic growth a much needed boost.
