"For release on delivery  11:30 a.m. EDT ( 8:30 a.m. PDT)  May 5 , 2017         Committee Decisions and Monetary Policy Rules    Remarks by  Stanley Fischer   Vice Chair man  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at  “The Structural Foundations  of Monetary Policy,”   a Hoover Institution Monetary Policy Conference   Stanford University   Stanford, California         May 5 , 2017   It is a pleasure to be at the Hoove r Institution again."
" In addition, many of the researchers and practitioners with whom I have discussed monetary policy over the years have had affiliations with the Hoover Institution --including several people here today."
" It is a pleasure also to have been  invited to speak at  this Hoover Institution M onetary P olicy Conference , for the Hoover conference series provides a valuable forum for policymakers and researchers to engage in dialogue about important monetary policy issues facing the United States  and other countries ."
Today I will offer some observations on monetary policy rules and their place in decisionmaking by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).1  I have two messages.
" Monetary P olicy R ules in Research and Policy  Since May 2014, I have considered monetary policy rules from the vantage point of a member of the FOMC."
" But my interest in them began many years ago and was reflected in some of my earliest publications.2  At th at time, the literature on monetary policy rules, especially in the United States, remained predominantly concerned with the money stock or total bank reserves rather than  the short -term interest rate.3  Seen with the                                                  1 Views expressed in this presentation are my own and not necessarily the views of the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee."
" 3 There was, however, a long tradition of monetary analysis in the United Kingdom and continental Europe that was centered on the authorities’ use of the interest rate as an instrument."
" In the post -World War II decades, this tradition continued in the U.K. research  - 2 - benefit of hindsight, that emphasis probably derived from three sources:  F irst, the quantity theory of money emphasized the link between the quantity of money and inflation; second, that research was carried out when monetarism was gaining credibility in the profession; and, third, there was a concern that interest rate rules might lead to price -level indeterminacy --an issue disposed of by Bennett McCallum and others.4   Subsequently, John Taylor’s research,  especially his celebrated 1993 paper, was a catalyst in changing the focus toward rules for the short -term interest rate.5  Taylor’s work thus helped shift the terms of the discussion in favor of rules for the instrument that central banks prefer to use."
" His 1993 study also highlighted the practical re levance of monetary policy rules, as he showed that a particular simple rule --the rule that now bears his name --provided a good approximation to the behavior of the federal funds rate during the early Greenspan years."
 T he research literature  on monetary policy rules has experienced  a major revi val since Taylor’s seminal paper and has concentrated on rules for the short -term interest rate .
                                                 literature on monetary policy:  Examples include Currie and Levine (1987) and Flemming (1993).
" In addition, an interest rate was the policy instrument in some key contributions to openeconomy  monetary theory, such as Meade (1951) and Mundell (1960)."
" These traditions likely reflected the longstanding use of Bank Rate as a policy instrument in the United Kingdom and the fact that, for most  of the period from the Treasury/Federal R eserve Accord of 1951 until the 1990s, central banks in countries other than the United States tended to be more explicit than the Federal Reserve chose to be about their use of short -term interest rates as their primary policy instrument."
" I sho uld add that when we presented work based on Cooper and Fischer (1972), we were urged by several economists  to focus on the interest rate as the monetary policy instrument."
"  - 3 - Consideration of interest rate rules has also, as I will discuss, come to have a prominent role in FOMC discussions, wi th the Taylor  rule being one benchmark that we regularly consult."
" But --building on recent remarks I made elsewhere-- I will also indicate why policymakers might have good reasons for deviating from these rule benchmarks and why, in pursuing the objectives of monetary policy, they could appropriately behave in ways that are not very well characterized by simple monetary policy rules.6  In particular, I will point to reasons why the FOMC’s discussions might lead to  decisions that depart--temporarily or perman ently --from the prescriptions of baseline monetary policy rules."
" Donald Kohn, at a landmark conference organized by John Taylor in January 1998, described the role played by monetary policy rules in the FOMC briefing process.7  His account noted that Federal Reserve staff members presented FOMC participants with prescriptions from  several policy rules, including the Taylor (1993) rule."
" The “Monetary Policy Strategies” portion of the Bluebook (and, later, the Tealbook) contains prescriptions from interest rate rules."
" Policy rule prescriptions , particularly prescriptions that are obtained from a dynamic model simulation, also help policymakers take to heart a key message of the literature on policy rules --namely, that monetary policy decisions should concern the ap propriate path for the policy instrument and not merely the current setting of that instrument."
" It is clear from transcripts in the public record that rule prescriptions have frequently been cited at FOMC meetings.10  The prominence that interest rate rules have achieved in Federal Reserve policymakers’ analysis of monetary policy was underscored by Chair Yellen in her speech at Stanford University earlier this year.11 Further, as is clear from Taylor’s econometric derivation of his 1993 rule, actual monetary policy decisions may --and probably should--exhibit systematic patterns that can be described as a rule."
"289), when considering McCallum’s (1988) proposed rule for monetary base growth, I described it as “a useful benchmark against which to judge policy.”  10 Searchable transcripts of FOMC meetings up to 2011 are available on the Board’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomc_historical.htm ."
"  - 5 - Taylor rule was that it described U.S. monetary policy patterns well over a certain period, one that was associated with a reasonable degree of economic stability."
" In the wake of the financial crisis, policymakers found it necessary to follow a more accommodative monetary policy that was appropriate for the  new economic conditions.12  In addition, structural changes in the U.S. economy have apparently lowered the value of the interest rate --that is, r*--consistent with neutral policy.13 Such structural changes were not anticipated in advance.14  Of course, once  a structural change has occurred and been ascertained by policymakers, they will know                                                  12 See especially Engen, Laubach, and Reifschneider (201 5)."
" 14 Indeed, Milton Friedman’s advocacy of a policy rule consisting of constant monetary growth rested in part on the  existence of uncertainty, as he suggested that economists lacked the knowledge about economic relationships required to improve on that simple rule."
" For this reason, policymakers might change their judgment about what monetary policy rules const itute reasonable benchmarks, or , over time , they might develop a procedure for revising the monetary rule."
"    Consequently, when considering the relationship between monetary policy decisions and monetary policy rules, we can expect two regularities to hold."
" First, actual monetary policy will sometimes appropriately depart from the prescriptions of benchmark rules even when those benchmarks descri be past decisions well."
" We have central banks for the very reason that there are no such rules.”15 As I will now elaborate, I believe the fact that monetary policy is made by committees in most economies is important in understanding both of these r egularities."
" For example, Friedman’s rule would likely perform poorly in an environment in which the trend rate of growth of monetary velocity underwent a major shift, while the Taylor rule could perform unsatisfactorily if the assumption about potential -output behavior embedded in the rule proved to be badly mistaken."
"  - 7 - The Role of Committees  in P olicy  Formation  Monetary policy decisions in the United States and elsewhere typically arise from a discussion and vote of a committee.16  In principle, a monetary policy committee could decide to follow a rule."
" The FOMC framework also balances centralized and decentralized decisionmaking by having most of the permanent voting members --specifically, the Board of Governors --be based in Washington, D.C.   All of the FOMC participants have common goals --maximum employment and price stability --that are given by the Federal Reserve’s statutory mandate."
" They have also agreed, for pursuing that mandate, on the Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy.18  But while they have this common ground, each FOMC participant brings to the table his or her own perspective or view of the world."
 Part of their role in                                                  16 I discussed  some of t he literature  on monetary policy committees in Fischer (2017b) .
" For example, the Committee’s discussions might point up factors that have not yet affected real economic activity and inflation."
" Such factors would not lead to an immediate change in the prescription for the federal funds rate obtained from a rule like the Taylor rule, as this prescription is a function of current values of the output gap and inflation."
 The Committee might nevertheless wish to adjust the federal funds rate immediately because the newly unearthed factors ar e likely to affect output and inflation in coming months.
" A case in point is the decline, as I mentioned, in  estimates  of the neutral interest rate."
" The concept of the neutral interest rate is a way of summarizing the various forces,  many of them unobservable,  that shift  the relationship between monetary policy and economic activity."
" The FOMC’s policy communications include its postmeeting statement, the minutes of its meetings, the Chair’s quarterly press conference, the Chair’s semiannual monetary policy testimony to the Congress, and other public remar ks by individual FOMC members."
 There remains a deeper qu estion about committee decisionmaking:  Why have almost all countries decided that monetary policy decisions should be made by a  - 10 - committee rather than by a rule?
" The answer is that opinions --even on monetary policy--differ among experts, while the economy is in a constant process of change."
" I have been a governor of two central banks and, even as the sole monetary policy decisionmaker in the Bank of Israel, would sometimes find that my initial view on the next decision change d as a result of discuss ions with the informal advisory committee with whom I consulted at that time."
" Those discussions, which recognize human frailty in analyzing a situation and the need to act despite considerable uncertainties, are the reason why committee decisionmaking is , on average , preferable to the use of a rule.19   Emphasis on a single rule as the basis for monetary policy implies that the truth has been found, despite the record over time of major shifts in monetary policy --from the gold standard, to the Bretton Woods fixed but changeable exchange rate rule, to                                                  19 The existing literature on monetary policy committees has found that committee decisions tend to be better than decisions  made by a sole policymaker."
" - 11 - Keynesian approaches, to monetary targeting, to the modern frameworks of inflation targeting and the dual mandate of the Fed, and more."
 The prescriptions of monetary policy rules play a prominent role in the FOMC’s monetary policy deliberations.
" But, for the reasons I have outlined, adherence to a simple  policy rule is not the most appropriate means of achieving macroeconomic goals --and there are very good reasons why monetary policy decisions are typically made in committees whose structure  allows them to assess the varying conditions of  different regions and economic sectors, as well as to reflect different beliefs about the working of the economy."
