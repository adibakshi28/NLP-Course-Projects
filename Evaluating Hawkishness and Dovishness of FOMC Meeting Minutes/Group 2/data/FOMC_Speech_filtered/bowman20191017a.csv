"Bowman   Member   Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at  “Monetary Policy ’s Impact on Workers and Their Communities ” a  Fed Listens e vent sponsored by the F ederal Reserve Bank of Chicago    Chicago, Illinois         October 17, 2019    Thank you, President Evans, for hosting this event today, and to our moderator and participants for taking part in this valuable discussion."
 Today’s event is the last in our series of Fed Listens  events held across the country to learn about how Americans  think about monetary policy and how they think about the Federal Reserve.
  Fed Listens  is a new comprehensive outreach to the public on monetary policy.
 For many decades t here was a sense at the Board that the public wasn’t interested or even  willing to dive into the complexities of monetary policy.
" When we communicate our views on the economic outlook and our expectations  for where interest rates may be heading, consumers and  - 2 - businesses take that information into account when making decisions on spending, investment, and hiring."
 We have heard  from many people  from different parts of the country and from different sectors of the economy about how monetary policy affect s them and their communities.
 H earing a broad range of perspectives on these issues will help us make good decisions as we consider new approaches to monetary policy.
"   Our monetary policy review will have  implications for financial markets , but we also want to know more about what the impact will be on Main Street ."
The two goals for monetary policy —maximum employment and stable prices —are determined by  the Congress  and are not subject to our framework review.
" For example,  inflation has  run modestly below our 2 percent objective  for many years ."
" Given that, it would be helpful to hear whether you think the Federal Open Market Committee should consider strategies that aim to have inflation exceed our target for a period of time to make up for the earlier shortfall  or whether you think that would t hreaten the decades of success the Fed has had keeping the public’s inflation expectation s low and stable ."
 Another question concern s the Fed’s existing toolkit for monetary policy.
" Currently, our available policy tool s include  setting interest rates, purchasing longer -term assets, and forward guidance about the expected future path of policy."
 Your perspective s on questions  like these are a vital part of this monetary policy review .
