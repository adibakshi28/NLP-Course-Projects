"For release on delivery  4:00 p.m. EDT   September 25, 2024         How We Got Here:  A Perspective on Inflation and the Labor Market     Remarks by   Adriana D."
" In my remarks today, I will provide my outlook for the U.S. economy and the implications for monetary policy."
" The combination of significant ongoing progress in reducing inflation and a cooling in the labor market mean s that the  time has come to begin easing monetary policy, and I strongly supported the decision last week by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to cut the federal funds rate by 50 basis points."
" While future actions by the FOMC will depend on data we receive on inflation, employment , and economic activity, if conditions continue to evolve in the direction traveled thus far, then additional  cuts will be appropriate."
" I will begin by summarizing where we stand on inflation, including details on  how the different components of inflation have changed over time , since  these facts form the basis for my judgment on where inflation is headed."
  I will conclude with the implications of all this for appropriate monetary policy  and our focus on our dual mandate .
Inflation based on personal consumption expenditures (PCE) has come down from a peak of 7.1 percent on a  year -onyear basis to 2.5 percent in July.
" Core PCE inflation , which  excludes  energy and food prices and tends  to be less volatile, has come down from a peak of 5.6 percent to now 2.6 percent."
"  - 2 - price ind exes, I estimate headline PCE  and core PCE inflation to be at about 2.2 and 2."
"  The progress on inflation is good news, but it is important to remember that households and businesses are still dealing with prices for many goods and services that are significantly higher than a couple of years ago."
" Prices for groceries, for example, are about 20 percent higher than before inflation started rising in 2021, and while earnings  have been rising faster than inflation, it may take some time for it to feel as though prices are back to normal.2 Inflation data are produced by the Labor Department , and when I served as chief economist at Labor, I delved into the differential effects of inflation  on various  demographic groups ."
" When inflation was at its peak in 2022, it was more than 1 percentage point higher for lower -income households, for those without a college degree , and for those aged 18 to 29 —all groups that spend a higher share of income on necessities and have less wealth to draw from.3  Fortunately, research by staff at the Fed shows that disinflation helps close that gap  as well , something that only adds to the urgency I feel about returning inflation to the FOMC’s 2 percent goal."
 Research on the causes of inflation and the subsequent disinflation show that both supply and demand for ces have played an important role.
" In the past two years, specifically, i mprovements in supply, along with moderation in demand in part due to  2 Unlike in previous recoveries, those in the lower half of the distribution have benefited more from the real earnings increases during the post -pandemic period."
" The 12 -month change in average hourly earnings and the employment cost index have been rising faster than consumer price index inflation for those in the first and second quartiles since 2019 and since 2022, respectively, and for everyone across the dis tribution for roughly a year."
" 3 See Xavier Jaravel (2021), “Inflation Inequality:  Measurement, Causes, and Policy Implications ,” Annual Review of Economics , vol."
" - 3 - tighter monetary policy, have both played a role in the  disinflation ary process.4  Supply chain bottlenecks as well as the drastic drop in the labor force due to excess retirements and the withdrawal of prime -age workers  contributed to the initial rise in inflation, but the resolution of these disruptions and  the return of workers to the labor force ha ve also helped rein in inflation."
" B ut as the demand shock to goods unwound and consumer spending shifted back to services, goods inflation fell and has been running below zero in recent months."
" Also, the increased demand due to the fiscal response to C OVID19 in 2020 and 2021 has more recently been roughly neutral on growth, as shown by the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy in their measure of fiscal impact."
" And , of course, as I will discuss in a moment, tight monetary policy has been and continues to be a moderating force on demand, primarily by raising costs for inter estsensitive goods and services."
"  As I think about where inflation is headed, I find it helpful to consider how it has evolved over the past several  years and in particular how the major components of inflation have behaved, so I want to take a few minutes to walk through those details."
"  4 Different approaches allow a parsing of the relative contributions of supply and demand, top -down approaches by Bernanke and Blanchard ( forthcoming ) and Benigno and Eggertson (2023)  and bottom -up approaches by Braun , Flaaen, and Hoke (2024)  and Shapiro (2022) ; see Ben Bernanke and Olivier Blanchard (forthcoming), “What Caused the U.S. Pandemic -Era Inflation?” American Economic Journal:  Macroeconomics ; Pierpaolo Benigno and Gauti B."

 All of these studies agree that both supply and demand shocks contributed to the surge in inflation  as well as its  fall.
" - 4 - As I have indicated, the big picture is that goods inflation surged early on in 2020 and 2021, followed by prices for services excluding housing, and then housing, with some overlap in those steps ."
 Disinflation has followed that course in reverse.
" Core goods inflation rose , after al most a year of social distancing shifted spending from services and after production and delivery of goods was disrupted by the pandemic."
" This was a big change because over the long expansion leading to the pandemic, core g oods prices actually fell, slightly but consistently.5  On a 12month basis, c ore PCE goods inflation rose above zero in December 2020, reached a peak of 7.6 percent in February 2022, and fell again below zero at the end of 2023."
 This recent disinflation offset stillrising prices for services and helped reduce overall inflation.
 Goods inflation has reverted to its longer -term pattern as demand has moderated and supply chain problems have abated.
" This is reflected by various  indexes of supply chain bottlenecks that showed the supplyside disruptions that contributed early on to surging inflation have now retreated to pre -pandemic levels.6  Other data show that computer chip supply, which fell far short of demand early in the pandemic, is back to normal conditions  as well ."
"Food and energy prices, always subject to larger ups and downs than other parts of inflation, rose also early on."
 F ood inflation increas ed in 2020 as shoppers began stockpiling groceries and as warehouses and production facilities  had difficult y staffing due to COVID.
" After Russia ’s invasion of Ukraine, energy price  inflation reached a peak  5 The causes most often cited by economists are competition from globalized trade and productivity gains, including from technological advances."
"  - 5 - 12month rate of nearly 45 percent and food inflation reached a peak of 12 percent in mid2022, highlight ing the importance of petroleum  and agricultural commodities from that part of the world."
  Food and energy inflation has moderated over the past two years and are now both running at 12mont h rate s of 1.
" Food and energy expenses  represent  a sizable share of consumer spending, but the frequent purchase  of these goods means that they are highly salient in the public’s views on inflation."
" Research by Francesco D’Acunto and coauthors has shown that the weights that consumers assign to price changes in forming  their inflation expectations are not based on the actual share of their expenditure s but instead on the frequency of purchase s, which happen to be high est for  food and energy goods.7  Thus, the fall in  food and energy prices is important beca use it may feed back into lower  inflation in other categories by moderating overall inflation expec tations and also  real wage expectations in wage bargaining."
"   Housing services price increases were the last component of inflation to escalate, rising to a peak 12month rate of 8.3 percent in April 2023 and moderating to a 5.3 percent pace in July."
" It took time for housing prices to escalate and has taken longer for them to moderate because of both the nature of the rental market  and the data collection method from the Bureau of Labor Sta tistics , as I have discussed at length in other speeches.8  However, new rent increases, which better capture rental price changes in real  7 See Francesco D’Acunto , Ulrike Malmendier, Juan Ospina, and Michael Weber  (2021) , “Exposure to Grocery Prices and Inflation Expectations ,” Journal of Political Economy,  vol."
" The final component of inflation is services excluding housing, which accounts for 50 percent of PCE inflation and is heavily influenced by labor markets."
" On a 12month basis, this component of  inflation rose to  a peak of 5.3 percent in December 2021, stayed persistently high until Feb ruary 2023, and has moderated since then to 3.3 percent in July of this year ."
 Its escalation was driven both  by the rise  in labor costs and by the transition of demand f rom goods to services following the pandemic .
" Among the initial forces driving the escalation in wages were the increase in food and energy prices , as wage demands tend to track closely with the prices of these frequently purchased goods ."
" Data on wage demands from the New York Fed’s Survey of Consumer Expectations indeed show a sudden increase early on during the pandemic right after the first bout  of food inflation.9  Importantly,  worker shortages likely allowed those higher wage  demands  to be realized , contribut ing to the rise in wages."
" Later, as demand for services quickly rose and employers were creating a large number  of job s in several service sectors, workers were able to be more selective, and the ensuing “Great Resignation” took hold, allowing  people to choo se different career s."

"Kugler (2024), “Some Reasons for Optimism about Inflation,” speech delivered at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, Washington, D.C., June 18, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240618a.htm ."
"  - 7 - demand relative to the supply of workers in some service sectors encouraged workers to move from job to job for higher wages, benefit s, and other improvements in working conditions."
" Evidence from the Atlanta Fed’s W age Growth  Tracker  suggests that during this period , wages for job switchers grew more than 2 percentage points faster than wages for people staying in the same job, though this  wage premium for job switchers disappeared by the second half of  last year ."
"But now inflation for services excluding housing is declining, after a temporary escalation in the first quarter of this year  that was likely partly due to residual seasonality."
" To sum up, inflation has broadly moderated as the supply of goods and services has improved, and as producers and consumers have adjusted to the effects of higher prices."
" Demand  has moderated, in part due to tighter monetary policy."
" A nd, a s I just noted, changes in the pace of wage growth have also played an important role in the ups and downs of inflation, which  points me toward a  discuss ion of labor markets , which  has recently become a greater focus of monetary policy."
" Unemployment was 7.8 percent in September 2020 and 4.7 percent only 12 months later, and it fell to under 4 percent  3 months after that ."
" What started , at that point, was 30 straight  months  of unemployment at or below  4 percent, which had not happened  during the pre -pandemic period, the boom of the 1990s, or anytime during the 1980s, and it was only exceeded by the strong labor market of the latter half of the 1960s."
" For example, there has been a reduction in the unemployment rate between Black and Latino workers, on the one hand, and w hite workers , on the other hand."
" The real wage gains for those in the lower quartiles of the distribution and with higher propensit ies to consume, in turn, likely spurred consumption and helped  sustain growth after the pandemic."
" After a couple of years in which labor demand exceeded  supply, the labor market has come into balance, reflecting an economy that has moderated in part due to tighter monetary policy."
"As a resu lt of improved supply and easing of demand for workers, the labor market has rebalanced ."
" After running at very low levels, unemployment has edged up this year  to 4.2 percent in August, still quite low by historical standards."
 The slowdown in labor demand is most evident in payroll numbers.
" In addition, the fall in diffusion ind exes suggest s that job creation cooling has been broad based, complementing the payroll data in showing rebalances in demand and supply across sectors."
" The ratio of job vacancies to the number of people looking for  - 10 - work , the V /U ratio,  has also fallen close to its pre -pandemic ratio .11  In summary, after a period of demand exceeding supply, the labor market appears to have rebalanced ."
" In tandem with the cooling in the labor market, economic activity has slowed but is still expanding at a solid pace."
" After adjusting for inflation, gross domestic product (GDP) grew 2.5 percent in 2023 and at around a 2 percent annual rate in the first half of 2024."
" Personal spending, which accounts for  the majority of economic activity, has been solid this year, supported by a resilient labor market so far and high levels of household wealth relative to income ."
" Certainly, tight monetary policy has contributed to cool off aggregate demand and slow the economy."
Another effect of tight monetary policy is to keep expectations of future inflation in check .
" And, to the extent that expectations affect decisions by businesses to set prices and by workers to negotiate wages, this has helped put downward pressure on inflation."
" Surveyand market -based measures of future inflation did increase when inflation surged, but only modestly, and they have moved down in tandem with inflation and have largely returned to their 2019 levels."
 The denominator is the unemployment rate.
" The last data point available for job openings is July 2024,  while the last data point for the unemployment rate is August."
"   - 11 - In conclusion, I would say that recent economic developments, against the backdrop of the experience of the past four years, have validated  the Federal Reserve’s focus on reducing inflation and set the stage for the shift in monetary policy that occurred last week."
" The progr ess in bringing down inflation  thus far , coupled with the softening in the labor market that I have described, mean s that while our focus should remain on continuing to bring inflation to 2 percent , we should now also shift attention to  the maximum -employment side of the FOMC’s dual mandate."
" T he labor market remains resilient , but the FOMC  now needs  to balance its  focus so we can continue making progress on disinflation while avoid ing unnecessary pain and weakness in the economy as disinflation continues  in the right trajectory ."
" I strongly supported last week’s decision and, if progress on inflation continues as I expect, I will support additional cuts in the federal funds rate going forward."
