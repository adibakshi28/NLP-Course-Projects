"For release on delivery  9:00 a.m. EDT  October 14 , 2020         U.S. Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy     Remarks by  Richard H."
" I look forward , as always , to my conversation with Tim, but first, please allow  me to offer a few remarks on the econ omic outlook, Federal Reserve monetary policy, and our new monetary policy framework ."
" The flow of macrodata received  since May has been surprisingly strong , and GDP growth in the third quarter is estimated b y many forecasters to have rebounded at perhaps a 25  to 30 percent annual rate."
 This development is especially noteworthy when set in relief against the surge in new C OVID19 cases that were reported this summer in a number of U.S. states and the coincide nt flatlining  in a numb er of high -frequency activity indicators that we follow to track the effect of the virus on economic activity.
 These components of aggregate demand have benefited from robust fiscal support —including the Paycheck Protection Program and expanded unemployment benefits —as well as low interest rates and efforts by the Federal Reserve to sustain the flow of credit to households and firms.
" In the labor market , about half of the 22 million jobs that were lost in the spring have been restored, and the unemployment rate has fallen since April by nearly 7 percentage points to 7.9 percent as of September."
 It will likely take even longer than tha t for the unemployment rate to return to a level consistent with our maximumemployment mandate.
" However, it is worth highlighting that the Committee’s baseline projections summarized in the most recent Summary of E conomic Projections  foresee a relatively  rapid return to mandate -consistent levels of employment and inflation as compared with the recovery from the Global Financial Crisis (GFC).2  In particular, the median Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC ) participant projects that by the end of 2023—a lit tle more than three years from                                                 2 The most recent Summary of Econ omic Projections, an addendum to the minutes of the September 2020 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, is available on the Board’s website at https://www.federalreser ve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm ."
"  - 3 - now—the unemployment rate will have fallen to 4  percent , and PCE (personal consumption expenditures) inflation will have returned to 2 percent."
" Following the GFC, it took more than eight years for employment and inflation to  return to similar mandate -consistent levels."
"The September FOMC Decision and the New Monetary Policy  Framework    At our September FOMC meeting , the Committee made important changes  to our policy statement that upgraded our forward guidance about the future path of the federal funds rate, and that also provided unprecedented information about our policy reaction function."
" We indicated that, with inflation running persis tently below 2 percent, our policy will aim to achieve inflation outcomes that keep inflation expectations well anchored at our 2 per cent longer -run goal."
"  We said that we expect to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomes —as well as our  maximum -employment mandate —are achieved, and also that we expect it will be appropriate to maintain the current 0 to 1/4 percent target range for the federal funds rate until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessments of maximum employment , until  inflation has risen to 2 percent , and until inflation is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time."
  The September  FOMC meeting was the first since the Committee approved  in August our new Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy and adopted a new policy framework.3  The changes we made in our September FOMC statement bring our policy guidance in lin e with this new framework.
" In our new framework, we acknowledg e that  policy decisions going forward will be based on the FOMC’s estimates of “ shortfalls  [emphasis added] of employment from its maximum level” —not “deviations .”  This language means that going forward, a low unemployment rate, in and of itself , will not be sufficient to trigger a tightening of monetary policy absent any evidence from other indicators that inflation is at risk of moving above mandate -consistent levels."
" With regard to our  pricestability mandate, while the new statement maintains our definition that the longer -run goal for inflation is 2 percent, it elevates the importance—and the challenge —of keeping inflation expectations well anchored  at 2 percent  in a world  in which an effective -lower -bound constraint is , in downturns , binding  on the federal funds rate."
"  To this end, the new statement conveys the Committee’s judgment that, in order  to anchor expectations at the 2 percent  level consistent with price stability , it “seeks to achieve inflation that averages 2  percent over time,” and —in the same sentence—that therefore “following periods when inflation has been running persistently below 2  percent, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately abov e 2 percent for some time.”  As Chair Powell indicated                                                 3 The statement is available on the Board’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/review -ofmonetary -policy -strat egytools -andcommunications -statementon -longer -rungoals -monetary -policy -strategy.htm ."
"  - 5 - in his Jackson Hole remarks, we think of our new framework as an evolution from “flexible inflation targeting” to “flexible average inflation targeting.”4  While this new framework represents a robust evolution in our monetary policy strategy, this strategy is in service to the dual -mandate goals of monetary policy assigned to the Federal Reserve by the Congress —maximum employment and price stability —which remain unchanged .5 Concluding Remarks  While eco nomic recovery since the spring collapse has been robust , let us not forget that full economic recovery from the COVID -19 recession has a long way to go ."
" Although the unemployment rate has declined sharply since April, it remains elevated as of September  at 7.9 percent and would be about 3 percentage points higher if labor force participation remained at February 2020 levels."
" Moreover, despite a recent uptick, inflation is still running below our 2 percent longer -run objective."
" It will take some time to return  to the levels of economic activity and employment that prevail ed at the business cycle peak in February, and additional support from monetary —and likely fiscal —policy will be needed."
