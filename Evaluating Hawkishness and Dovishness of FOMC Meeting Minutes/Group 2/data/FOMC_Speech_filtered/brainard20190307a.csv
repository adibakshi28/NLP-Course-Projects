"For release on delivery  12:15 p.m. EST  March 7, 2019          Navigating Cautiously     Remarks by   Lael Brainard   Member   Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at the  JulisRabinowitz Center for Public Policy and Finance  and the Bendheim Center for Finance  Woodrow Wilson School  of Public and International Affairs  Princeton University   Princeton, New Jersey         March 7, 2019    While our economy continues to add jobs  at a solid pace, demand appears to have softened against a backdrop of greater downside risks."
 Prudence counsels a period of watchful waiting --especially with no signs that inflation is picking up.
" Both the modal outlook a nd the risks around it have im portant implications for monetary policy, but in somewhat different ways."
This  softening could be a harbinger of some slowing in the underlying momentum of domestic demand.
"  - 2 - last month of the quarter, that decline suggests that growth in consumer spending may be held down in the first quarter of this year."
" And although recent readings are below those that prevailed for much of 2018, they are still in a range consistent with ongoing spending growth."
" Residential construction data have been soft for some tim e, reflecting in part earlier increases in interest rates, and homebuilders report that supply constraints on available lots, shortages of skilled workers, and tariffs on inputs are also contributing to the slowdown."
" While strong foreign growth provided tailwinds ea rly last year, foreign growth  - 3 - projections have been revised down repeatedly  more recently .2  The slowdown of foreign growth now appears to be more persistent than initially assumed, with growth  likely running  below potential for most of last year ."
"  Econom ic activity slowed noticeably in the second half of 2018 in China , where policymakers have been trying to achieve a balance between restraining very elevated levels of domestic debt, on the one hand, and  maintaining strong a ggregate growth, on the other."
The slow down in  foreign  demand spill s over into the U nited S tates through a variety of channels.
" Although the dollar has weakened somewhat lately, its  earlier appreciatio n and slowing foreign growth contributed to a decline in exports and a fall in import prices over the second half of last year."
" The tariffs and trade disruptions that have occurred so far are estimated to have had relatively modest effects on aggregate growth and inflation, although damaging disruptions have been concentrated in some sectors, such as soybeans."
" The Bipartisan Budget  Act, which is estimated to boost GDP growth by  0.3 percent age point , on average , per year in 2018 and 2019, is scheduled to expire in 2020."
"Employment, Inflation , and Policy In contrast to the softening in spending indicators, job gains have remained s trong  so far ."
 The  January unemployment rate of  4 percent is near a multidecade low.
" The str ong labor ma rket has drawn  many Americans into productive w ork, and the overall employment -topopulation ratio for workers between the ages of 25 and 54 is now within 1/2 percentage point of its precrisis peak."
" Just as  the economy is  performing well on the maximumemployment goal set by the Congress , it is also close to meeting  our price -stability mandate ."
 So inflation is  very close to the Committee’s 2  percent objective and its earlier ex pectation .
"  Even so, we will need to be vigilant to ensure inflation achieves 2 percent on a sustained basis."
" As I have observed for some time, underlying trend inflation may be  running  slightly below the Committee’s 2  percent objective."
" M any statistical filtering models put underlying inflation modestly  below 2 percent, and some survey measures of inflation expectations are running somewhat below pre -crisis levels."
" Similarly, the difference between the yields on nominal and inflation -indexed Treasury securities is lower than it was before the crisis, and that difference may provide some insight into market participants’ views of underlying inflation.5   The fact that estimates of  underlying trend inflation remain a bit on the soft side reinforces the evidence that the Phillips curve is very flat, a key element of the post -crisis                                                  3 For the share of overall income going to workers , see, for instance, data on the labor share in the nonfarm business sector --available from the FRED database on the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis’s website at https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PRS85006173 --and Bureau of L abor Statistics (2017)."
" 4 I focus on the core measure because food and energy prices are volatile,  and total inflation has generally fluctuated around core inflation."
   - 7 - new normal that I have noted previously .6  The responsiveness of price inflation to resource utilizatio n at the national level has been very weak for some time.
" As the unemployment rate has fallen to levels not seen in many decades, we have heard concerns that the steeper Phillips curve of  the past might reassert itself, perhaps in a nonlinear manner.7  But all available evidence suggests inflation expectations remain well  anchored to the upside."
"   Indeed, the contours of today’s new normal suggest we should be equally attentive to a risk of erosion in inflation  expectations to the downside."
 A range of evidence suggests that the long -run “neutral” rate of interest --the rate of interest consistent with the economy growing at its potential rate and stable inflation --is very low relative to its h istorical levels.
" In turn, more frequent or extended episodes when inflation is below target and policy is at the effective lower bound risk pulling down private -sector inflation expectations in a self -reinforcing downward spiral, which could further compress the monetary policy buffer to cushion downside shocks.8   The Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) has made cl ear that the 2  percent inflation goal is symmetric.9 As the median SEP forecasts  have indicated, a number of Committee members ha ve previously projected a policy path consistent with inflation                                                  6 See Brainard (2015 , 2016) for a discussion of this and other elements of  what I referred to as  the new normal."
"    There is a separate discussion of policies that would pre -commit to  make up for past misses on inflation, such as temporary price -level targeting, which  may be important in circumstances with a low long -run neutral rate and more frequent effective -lower -bound episodes.10  I expect  this will be part of our review of monetary policy strategies, tools, and communication practices later this year .11 Our policy goal now is to preserve the progress we have made on maximum employment and target inflation."
 Core inflation last year came in around target.
"   With regard to policy , modest downward revisions to the baseline outlook for output and employment would call for modest downward revisions to the path for our conventional policy tool, the federal funds rate, helping to  offset some of the weakness  that would ot herwise weigh on the economy."
" These downside risks, if realized, could weigh o n economic activity .12  So heightened downside risks to output and employment would argue for a softer federal funds rate path even if the modal outlook for the economy w ere unchanged."
"  - 9 - At a time when the modal outlook appears to have softened a bit , and r isks appear more weighted to the downside than the upside, the best way to safeguard the gains we have made on jobs and inflation is to navigate cautiously on rates."
 Risk management in an environment of a low long -run neutral rate and an attenuated relationship between resource utilization and overall inflation supports this approach.
 Watchful waiting will allow us to ga ther more information about domestic momentum and foreign growth as well a s some of the policy r isks weighing on sentiment.
" Recall that, after reducing the federal funds rate to its effective lower bound of zero in the 200809 recession, the FOMC sought  a mechanism for providing additional stimulus in order to achieve maximum employment and target inflation.13  The Federal Reserve purchased longer -term Treasury securities in an effort to push down longer -term interest rates to  support economic activity, an approach sometimes referred to as quantitative easing."
 Demand has grown for the Fed’s liabilities from a variety of sources.
" The demand for U.S. currency has grown notably relative to nominal GDP, the Treasury Department now holds large balances in its account at the Fed as an important part of its cash management , and foreign central banks  hold larger deposits than in the past ."
" In addition, the demand from commercial banks for deposits at the Fed-- that is, “reserves” --appears to have increased substantially."
" For the past decade, the Federal Reserve has operated a regime with reserves that are very abundant  relative to banks’ demand for reserves."
" The current framework relies  on the Federal Reserve’s interest rate on reserves to control the federal funds rate , in the context of  the provision of  ample reserves ."
" In contrast, the pre -crisis framework featured a scarce supply of reserves, which the Federal Reserve would vary on a  daily basis to control the federal funds rate by closely matching the demand for reserves."
" Not only is the demand for reserves likely to remain much higher than it was before  the crisis, but it is also likely that there will be  fluctuations in reserves , along with  other elements of the Fed’s liabilities , such as the deposits the Treasury holds with the Fed."
" By remaining in a regime with ample reserves, the Fed is able to control short -term interest rates without the need to conduct daily open market operations."
" Because there are ample reserves, the federal funds  rate and other short -term interest rates are determined along the flat portion of the reserve demand curve."
" As a result, the system can absorb swings in the demand and supply of reserves with limited need for open market operations."
" The alternative of p ushing reserves close to the transition point between the flat and steep parts of the demand curve would likely lead to active intervention as an ongoing feature , along with volatility in rates ."
"  After holding the size of the balance s heet roughly flat since mid -2014, once the normalization of the federal funds rate was deemed well under  way in October 2017, the Committee started to allow the size of the balance sheet to shrink in line with the pledge to “hold no more securities than ne cessary to implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively .”16  We have made substantial progress, as demonstrated by the level of reserves."
" In my view, asset redemptions should come to an end later in the year , which would provide a sufficient buffer of reserves to meet demand and avoid volatility."
 We have gathered information from market contacts and have surveyed banks to assess their  demand for reserves.17  I would want to see a healthy cushion on top of that to avoid unnecessary volatility and ensure that the federal funds rate will be largely insulated from daily swings  in factors affecting reserves .
 Our goal now is to safeguard the progress we have made on full employment and  target inflation.
