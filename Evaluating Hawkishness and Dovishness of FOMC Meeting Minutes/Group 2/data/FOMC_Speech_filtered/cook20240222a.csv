  Then I will conclude with a discussion of my views on current monetary policy.
" During the postpandemic recovery  in 2021 and 2022 , as strong aggregate demand met stillconstrained supply , inflation in many economies rose to levels not seen in decades ."
" Uncertainty about  the future course of inflation and the supply side of the economy  was high, both in the short run and in the longer run."
 Would inflation become stuck well above the Fed’s 2 percent target or even continue to rise?
 Inflation Uncertaint y Recent developments appear to have narrowed  the range of uncertainty about the inflation outlook .
" After rising to more than 7 percent in mid -2022, 12month inflation in the personal consumption expenditure s (PCE) price index fell to 2.6 percent in December ."
" Core PCE inflation (excluding food and energy) fell to 2.9  percent, its first reading below 3 percent since early 2021."
"  Inflation d ata over the second half of last year were  even more favorable, with core PCE inflation averaging less than 2 percent ."
"The disinflationary process has been, and may continue to be , bumpy and uneven, as highlighted by last week’s report s on the consumer price index  and the producer price index."
 But a forecast of 12 -month PCE inflation converging to our 2 percent target over - 3 -  time still seems reasonable as the  baseline outlook .
" Housing services inflation , which rose sharply in 2021 and 2022, should continue to decline  this year  as the slowing observed in rent increases on new leases passes into the official statistics ."
" Inflation in core services ex  housing (a broad category that includes items such as restaurant meals , car insurance, health care , hotel rooms , and airfares ) slowed over the course of last year and should continue to ease over time as consumers increasingly resis t price increases and as firms’ labor costs grow more slowly .2  Finally,  with supply chains largely back to normal and goods prices declining over the second half of last year , core goods inflation looks likely to converge  to its modestly negative pre -pandemic trend ."
 The behavior of inflation expectations helps underpin my growing confidence that inflation will continue to ease.
 Long -term inflation expectations remained well anchored  during the period of high inflation.
" For example, consumers’ expectations of inflation 5 to 10 years ahead in the University of Michigan survey rose only modestly, staying within the range of the previous 20 years."
" Moreover, consumers’ expectations of inflation one year ahead, which rose sharply with actual inflation, ha ve returned to  near their pre -pandemic levels in both the Michigan survey and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Survey of Consumer Expectations ."
 - 4 -  Short -Run Supply Uncertainty  A strong supply -side recovery  has contributed importantly to the recent disinflation .
 Goods demand has moderated in response to both higher interest rates and a shift in demand away from goods and back toward services.
 A rebound in immigration from the lows reached during the pandemic boosted growth in the working -age population.
" Labor Market Is Normalizing  Overall, demand and supply in the labor market appear to have come into  better alignment over the past year, after two years of considerable upheaval ."
- 5 -  indicators  suggest continued strength in the labor market but also areas worth monitoring for softening  demand .
"The s igns of strength  include an unemployment rate of 3.7 percent , up only modestly from the multidecade low reached last year."
"  After slowing through much of the past year, payroll growth rebounded in December and January."
" Employment growth also broadened  in the most recent months  after having been concentrated in health care, state  and local government, and leisure and hospitality —all of which had been playing catch -up."
 Data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta show that the wage growth differential between job switchers  and those staying in their jobs has narrowed .
 More comprehensi ve measures of wage growth show gradual cooling.
" At the same time, layoffs and claims for unemployment insurance remain low, implying that all the slowing in labor demand thus far has been along the hiring margin."
" One area of uncertainty worth watching is whether greater moderation  in labor demand could eventually cause firms to react on the layoff margin, which would likely lead to a much more pronounced rise in unemployment than we have seen so far."
"  - 6 -  Economic Resilience and Monetary Policy Effectiveness  Economic activity, especially consumer spending, proved more resilient than expected last year."
"  Real gross domestic product ( GDP ) grew more than 3 percent on a fourquarter basis, with personal consumption expenditures accounting for over half of that growth."
 This broad resilience in the face of the sharp rise in interest rates since spring 2022 raises some  question s:  Why has growth remained robust  in the face of a sharp tightening of monetary policy ?
 Has the relationship between monetary policy and the economy fundamentally changed?
" To be sure, h igher interest rates have reduced  demand in some interest -sensitive sectors , such as housing , durable goods , and business investment in equipment and intangible capital ."
 But the effects of those higher rates have been muted by the ability of  many homeowners and firms to lock in low interest rates for longer terms before rates rose.
" Moreover , there has been pent -up demand in some sectors, such as motor vehicles, where supply was previously constrained by shortages of intermediate inputs , inclu ding computer chips ."
" Yet over time , these forces supporting demand  are wan ing."
" New firms and many smaller firms face higher interest rates, as do established firms that need to refinance their debt."
" Interest rates on a uto loans , at about 10 percent for new cars and 14  percent for used cars, are beginning to constrain demand for motor vehicles , while  auto production has recover ed to prepandemic levels as supply bottlenecks have eased."
 - 7 -  Labor  income growth was a significant support for consumer spending last year.
"Nonetheless , although the employment -topopulation ratio , at 60.2, is just below its post -pandemic high, average hours worked have fallen back to normal levels , and wage growth has slowed."
" Thus, growth in total labor income has slowed to near the pre -pandemic rate of about 5 percent  a year , which should contribute to moderating consumption."
" In addition, consumer  spending growth may face increasing headwinds from deteriorating household balance sheets."
" While the resolution of global supply bottlenecks has played a substantial role over the past year in easing inflation and supporting economic activity, it is likely that the post -pandemic world could be characterized by greater volatility of supply."

 Long -Run Uncertainty about  Productivity  Another long -run uncertainty concerns productivity growth and whether the strong performance in recent quarters will persist.
 Productivity growth is a key factor in the health of the overall economy and in our daily lives.
" If productivity growth remains strong, a faster pace of economic growth need  not be inflationary."
 Productivity is usually volatile and has been especially so since the pandemic.
" Nonetheless , an important part of the strong supply response last year was labor productivity growth at a robust 2.7 percent."
" Various possible explanations for the recent strong productivity performance  are the following :  5 See Laura Alfaro and Davin Chor (2023 ), “Global Supply Chains:  The Looming ‘Great Reallocation,’ ”  NBER Working Paper Series 31661 (Cambridge, Mass.:  National Bureau of Economic Research, September), https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w31661/w31661.pdf ."

- 10 -  • Strong demand and labor shortages may have spurred productive business investment and reorganization.
 Will the recent productivity surge  continue?
"  The rise in new businesses since the pandemic may increase innovation  over time .8  For instance, Klenow and Li (2020)  find that new and young firms account for half of all productivity growth despite accounting for only one -fifth of workers.9 Looking ahead, I see artificial intelligence (AI) as a potentially significant source of productivity growth, but that  will take time."
 History shows that the journey from invention of general -purpose technologies to innovation to productivity can be long and uneven.

"- 11 -  Monetary Policy  In the long run, productivity growth benefits from both sides of the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment."
" Given the disinflation and labor market normalization I have described, I believe the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals are moving into better balance  after being weighted toward excessive inflation ."
" When considering appropriate monetary policy, I now see two -sided risks."
 I am now weighing the possibility of easing policy too soon and letting inflation stay persistently high versus easing policy too late and causing unnecessary harm to the economy.
 I intend to closely monitor incoming data to determine whether the disinflation process is continuing and to observe the effects on the economy of the Federal Open Market Committee’s  (FOMC) previous policy tightening .
" I believe our current monetary policy stance is restrictive, putting significant downward pressure on aggregate demand."
 I would like to have greater confidence that inflation is  converging  to 2 percent before beginning to cut the policy rate.
" When the FOMC  raised the policy rate to its current level last July, the risk of inflation remaining above 3 percent for some time was quite salient."
" Since then, inflation has fallen more quickly than anticipated , and the risk of persistently high inflation , though it has not disappeared , appears to have diminished."
"  - 12 -  At some point, as we gain greater confidence that disinflation is ongoing and sustainable, that changing outlook w ill warrant a change in the policy rate."
 Restrictive monetary policy and f avorable supply developments this past year have put us in a good position to achieve both sides of the FOMC’s  mandate.
