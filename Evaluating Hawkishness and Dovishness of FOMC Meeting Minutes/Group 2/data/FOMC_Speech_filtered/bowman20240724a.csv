 Advance Together is an accelerator program for regional public –private –nonprofit partnerships seeking to improve education and employment outcomes for lower -income communities in Texas.
" As the nation’s central bank, the Federal Reserve Board is focused on our dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment."
" When we think about maximum employment, we also need to consider how to foster an inclusive economy that provides economic opportunities for everyone regardless of their circumstances."
 Leaders that collaborate with an identified plan and path over a sustained period of time toward a comprehensive vision achieve better outcomes and more inclusive economic growth.
" It also takes time and resources for communities to agree upon a common understanding of complex, local needs like improving college and career readiness or developing pathways to living wage employment."
