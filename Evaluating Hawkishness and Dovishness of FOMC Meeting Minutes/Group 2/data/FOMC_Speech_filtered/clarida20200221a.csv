"For release on delivery  1:30 p.m. EST  February 21, 2020         Financial Markets and Monetary Policy:  Is There a Hall of Mirrors Problem?"
"Clarida   Vice Chair   Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at the  2020 U.S. Monetary Policy Forum, sponsored by the Initiative on Global Markets at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business   New York, New York         February 21, 2020   Thank you to the conference organizers for inviting me here to discuss what former Chair Bernanke has famously ref erred to as a “ hall of mirrors ” problem:  a situation in which a central bank’s reaction function and financial market prices interact in economically suboptimal and potentially destabilizing ways .1  In my remarks today, I will lay out the way I think about the interplay between financial markets and monetary policy, with a focus on how I myself seek to integrate noisy but often correlated signa ls about the economy that I glean from models, surveys, and financial markets.2  Three Observations  I begin with three unobjectionable observations."
" First, because of Friedman’s long and variable lags, monetary policy should be —and, at the Fed , is—forward looking."
" Policy decisions made today will have no effect on today’s inflation or unemployment rates, so good policy needs to assess where the economic fundamentals are going tomorrow to calibrate appropriate policy today."
"   Second, because key variables that are crucial inputs for c onducting monetary policy—such as r*, u*, and expected inflation, to name just three —are both unobserved and time varying, responsible monetary policy requires informed views about how these variables evolve over time as well as a humility and an appreciat ion for the uncertainties surrounding baseline views, however well informed they might be."
" Third, when trying to make an inference about unobserved variables like r* or expected inflation, it is generally a good idea to seek data from multiple signals correlated with the variable of interest, so long as the signals themselves are not perfectly correlated with one another."
" Think of this third unobjectionable observation as a sort of “model averaging” or “triangulation” principle of robust inference in a noi sy and complex environment.3  Data Dependence  As I have written before, monetary policy needs to be —and, at the Fed , is— “data dependent” in two distinct ways.4  Policy should be data dependent in the sense that incoming data indicate  the position of the e conomy relative to the ultimate objectives of price stability and maximum employment."
" This information on where the economy is relative to the goals of monetary policy is an important input into standard interest rate                                                  3 See Bruce Hansen ( 2007) , “Least Squares Model Averaging,”  Econometrica , vol."

" - 3 - feedback rules, such as those introdu ced by John Taylor in 1993 and ones that continue today to inform monetary policy decisions  at the Fed and at other central banks .5      Monetary policy, however, also needs to be data dependent in the second sense —that incoming data contain signals —that c an enable the central bank to update its estimates of  r* and u* in order to ob tain its best estimate of the destination to which the economy is heading."
" A s I mentioned a moment ago, a challenge for policymakers is that key variables that are essential inputs to monetary policy—such as u*, r*, and expected inflation —cannot be observed directly and must be inferred from observed data ."
" And a s is indicated in the Summary of Economic Projections, Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) participants have, over the past seven years, repeatedly revised down their estimates of both u* and r* as unemployment fell and as real interest rates remained well below previous  estimates of neutral without the rise in inflation those earlier estimates would have predicted."
" In addition to u* and r*, an important input into any monetary policy assessment is the state of inflation expectations."
"  One of the robust messages from the DSGE (dynamic s tochastic general equilibrium ) literature on optimal monetary policy  is that,                                                  5 See John B."
" - 4 - away from the effective lower bound, optimal monetary policy will not eliminate all inflation volatility —there are always shocks—but will, under rational expectations (RE), deliver average, and under RE, expected, inflation equal to the target ."
" Since the late 1990s, inflation expectations appear to have been stable and well  anchored in the neighborhood of our 2 percent goal."
" However, like r* and u*, inflation expectations are not directly observable and so must be inferred from data."
    Financial Data and Monetary Policy Let me now discuss in more detail  how I use a form of model averaging to combine financial market data with data from surveys and econometric models to inform my thinking about the evolution of two key inputs to monetary policy:  r* and longrun expected inflation.
" To be sure, financial market signals are noisy, and day -today movements in asset prices are unlikely to tell us much about the cyclical or struc tural position of the economy, let alone r* and expected inflation."
" Signals derived f rom financial market data, when combined with signals revealed from surveys of households and firms along with the filtered estimates from economet ric models , can together provide valuable and reasonably robust foundations for real -time inference about the direction of travel in r* and expected inflation."
 The destination for the federal funds rate implied by a straight read of futures prices is in turn the sum of the market -implied r* plus market -implied  expected inflation.
 But these signal s from interest rate futures are only a pure measure of the  - 5 - expected policy rate path under the assumption of a zero risk premium.
" But when there is a divergence between the path or destination for the policy rate implied by the surveys and a straight read of interest rate derivatives prices, I place at least as much weight on the survey evidence—for example, derived from the surveys of primary deal ers and market participants conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York—as I do on the estimates obtained from market prices."
"  Finally, as another reality check, I , of course , always consult the latest estimate of r* produced by the Laubach and Williams  (2003) unobservable components statespace model , which, I should point out, includes no information on asset prices other than the short -term nominal interest rate itself.6  Quotes from the Treasury Inflation -Protected Securities (TIPS) market can provide valuable informa tion about both r * and expected inflation."
" TIPS market data, together with nominal Treasury yields, can be used to construct measures of “breakeven inflation” or inflation compensation that provide a noisy signal of market expectat ions of future inflation."
" But, again, a straight read of breakeven inflation based on TIPS curve forward real rates needs to be augmented with a model to filter out the liquidity and risk premium components that place a wedge between inflation compensatio n and expected inflation."
" - 6 - It is again useful to compare estimates of expected inflation derived from breakeven inflation data with estimates of expected inflation obtained from surveys —for example, the expected inflation over the next 5 to 10 years from the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers."
" Market - and surveybased estimates of expected inflation are correlated, but, again, when there is a divergence between the two, I place at least as much weight on the survey evidence as on the market -derived  estimates."
"  Again , here I also consult time -series models of underlying inflation, such as Stock and Watson (2007) and Cecchetti and others (2017), presented at the U.S. Monetary Policy Forum in 2017.7  At the Fed, the staff have estimated a statespace m odel decomposition of the common factor that drives a number of different measures of inflation expectations."
" As I look at all of this evidence from market signals, surveys, and econometric models, I judge that inflation expectations reside at the low end of the range I consider consistent with our price -stability goal of 2 percent personal consumption expenditure inflation in the long run."
"In both of the examples I have just disc ussed, the medium -frequency evolution of market -based, surveybased, and model -based estimates of r* and expected inflation have , over time , tended to move broadly together."
