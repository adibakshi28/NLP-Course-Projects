"  For release on delivery        12:25 p.m. EST         December 2, 2015         The Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy     Remarks by   Janet L."
 I will describe the progress the economy has made toward the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) goals of maximum employment and st able prices and what the current situation and the outlook imply for how monetary policy is likely to evolve to best foster the attainment of those objectives.
" The unemployment rate, which peaked at 10 percent in October 2009, declined to 5 percent in October of this year."
" At that level, the unemployment rate is near the median of FOMC participants’ most recent estimates of its longer -run norm al level.1  The economy has created about 13 million jobs since the low point for employment in early 2010, and total nonfarm payrolls are now almost 4 -1/2 million higher than just prior to the recession."
" Most recently, after a couple months of relatively  modest payroll growth, employers added an estimated 271,000 jobs in October."
"  Despite these substantial gains, we cannot yet, in my judgment, declare that the labor market has reached full employment."
"  Even in a stronger  job market, it is likely that many of these individuals would choose not to work."
 Examples here include people who had become too discouraged to search for work when the prospects for employment were poor and some who retired when their previous jobs ended.
" Likewise, some of those who report they don’t want to work now could change their minds in a stronger job market."
   Another margin of labor market slack not reflected in the unemployment rate consists of  individuals who report that they are working part time  but would prefer a full -time job and  cannot find one --those classified as “part time for economic reasons.”  The share of such workers jumped from 3 percent of total employment prior to the Great Recession to around 6 -1/2 percent by 2010.
" While this decline represents considerable progress, particularly given secular trends that over time may have increased the prev alence of part -time employment, I think some room remains for the hours of these workers to increase as the labor market improves further."
" More recently, however, we have seen a welcome pickup in the growth rate of average hourly earnings for all employees and of compensation per hour in the business sector."
"   Turning to overall economic a ctivity, U.S. e conomic output --as measured by inflation -adjusted gross domestic product (GDP), or real GDP --has increased at a moderate pace, on balance, during the expansion."
 Many economic forecasters expect growth roughly along those same lines in the fourth quarter.
"  Growth this year has been held down by weak net expor ts, which have subtracted more than 1/2 percentage point, on average, from the annual rate of real GDP growth over the past three quarters."
" Foreign economic growth has slowed, damping increases in U.S. exports, and the U.S. dollar has appreciated substant ially since the middle of last year, making our exports more expensive and imported goods cheaper."
" Household spending growth has been particularly solid in 2015, with purchases of new motor vehicle s especially strong."
" Job growth has bolstered household income, and lower energy prices have left consumers with more to spend on other goods and services."
" Finally, interest rates for borrowers remain low, due in par t to the FOMC’s accommodative monetary policy, and these low rates appear to have been especially relevant for consumers considering the purchase of durable goods.2 Other components of PDFP, including residential and business investment, have also advanced  this year."
"  On balance, the moderate average pace of real GDP growth so far this year and over the entire expansion has been sufficient to help move the labor market close r to the                                                    2 For a recent empirical assessment, see Johnson, Pence, and Vine (2014)."
   - 5 - FOMC’s goal of maximum employment.
" However, less progress  has been made on the second leg of our dual mandate --price sta bility --as inflation continues to run below the FOMC’s longer -run objective of 2 percent."
 Overall consumer price inflation --as measured by the change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures --was only 1/4 percent  over the  12 months ending in October .
" Because food and energy prices are volatile, it is  often helpful to look at inflation excluding those two categories --known as core inflation--which is typically a better indicator of future overall inflation than recent readings of headline inflation."
" But core inflation--which ran at 11/4 percen t over the 12 months ending in Oct ober--is also well below our 2 percent objective, partly reflecting the appreciation of the U.S. dollar."
" The stronger dollar has pushed down the prices of imported goods, placing temporary downward pressure on core inflat ion.3  The plunge in crude oil prices may also have had some small indirect effects in holding down the prices of non -energy items in core inflation, as producers passed on to their customers some of the reductions in their energyrelated costs."
" Taking account of these effects, which may be holding down core inflation by around 1/4 to 1/2 percentage point, it appears that the underlying rate of inflation in the United States has been running in the vicinity of 1 -1/2 to 13/4 percent."
" To summarize, I anticipate continued economic growth at a moderate pace that will be sufficient to generate additional increases in employment, further reductions in                                                    3 For a more detailed discussion of the recent behavior of inflation, see Yellen (2015)."
"   - 6 - the remaining margin s of labor market slack, and a rise in inflation to our 2 percent objective."
" I expect that the fundamental factors supporting domestic spending that I have enumerated today will continue to do so, while the drag from some of the factors that have been wei ghing on economic growth should begin to lessen next year."
" Although  the economic outlook, as always, is uncertain, I currently see the risks to the outlook for economic activity and the labor market as very close to balanced."
" Turning to the factors that have been holding down growth, as I already noted, the higher foreign exchange value of the dollar, as well as weak growth in some foreign economies, has restrained the demand for U.S. exports over the past year."
 I anticipate that the drag on U.S. economic growth from these factors will diminish in the next couple of years as the global economy improves and the adjustment to prior declines in oil prices is completed.
"  Although developments in foreign economies still pose risks to U.S. economic growth that we are monitoring, these downside risks from abroad have lessened since late summer."
" A number of other  emerging market economies have eas ed monetary and fiscal policy this year , and economic activity in these economies has improved of late."
 Accommodative monetary policy is also supporting economic growth in the advanced economies.
" A pickup in demand in many advanced  - 7 - economies and a stabil ization in commodity prices should, in turn,  boost the growth prospects of emerging market economies."
" This year the effect of federal fiscal policy on real GDP gr owth has been roughly neutral, in contrast to earlier years in which the expiration of stimulus programs and fiscal policy actions to reduce the federal budget deficit created significant drags on growth .4  Also, the budget situation for many state and loc al governments has improved as the economic expansion has increased the revenues of these governments, allowing them to increase their hiring and spending after a number of years of cuts in the wake of the Great Recession."
" Looking ahead, I anticipate that  total real government purchases of goods and services should have a modest positive effect on economic growth over the next few years.5   Regarding U.S. inflation, I anticipate that the drag from the large declines in prices for crude oil and imports over  the past year  and a half will diminish next year."
" With less downward pressure on inflation from these factors and some upward pressure from a further tightening in U.S. labor and product markets, I expect inflation to  move up to the FOMC’s 2 percent obje ctive over the next few years."
" Of course , inflation expectations play an important role in the inflation process , and my forecast of a return to our 2 percent objective over the medium term relies on a judgment  that longer -term inflation expectations remain reasonably well anchored."
" In this regard,  recent measures                                                    4 The C ongressional B udget O ffice estimates that current federal fiscal policies will have little effect on economic growth this year, but that earlier fiscal policy actions reduced the rate of real GDP growth roughly 11/2 percentage points in 2013 and about 1/4 percentage point in 2014 relative to what it would have been otherwise."
" The measure of longer -term inflation  expectations from the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers, in contrast, has lately edged below its typical range  in recent years."
" However , this measure often seems to respond modestly, though temporarily, to large changes in actual inflation, and the very low readings on headline inflation over the past year may help  explain some  of the recent decline in the Michigan measure .6  Market -based measures of inflation compensation have moved up some in recent weeks after declining to historically low levels earlier in the fall ."
" Convincing evidence that longer -term inflation expectation s have moved lower would be a concern because declines in consumer and business expectations about inflation could put downward pressure on actual inflation, making the attainment of our 2 percent inflation goal more difficult."
   Monetary  Policy  Let me now  turn to the implications of the economic outlook for monetary policy.
"  Some  participants projected  that it would be appropriate to wait until later to raise the target funds rate range,  but all agreed that the timing of a rate in crease                                                    6 For example, the University of Michigan survey measure of longer -term inflation expectations was temporarily elevated relative to its usual range in 2008 when crude oil and other commodity prices spiked and pushed up actual headline inflation for a time."
"  In the policy statement issued after its October meeting, the FOMC  reaffirmed its judgment  that it would be appropriate to increase  the target range for the federal funds rate when we had seen some further improvement in the labor market and were reasonably confident that inflation would move back to the Committee’s  2 percent objective over the medium term."
" That initial rate increase  would reflect the Committee’s judgment , based on a range of indicators , that the economy would continue to grow at a pace sufficient to generate further labor market improvement  and a return of inflation to 2 percent, even after the reduction in policy ac commodation."
"  As I have already noted, I currently judge  that U.S. econom ic growth  is likely to be sufficient over the next year or two to result in further improvement  in the labor market ."
" Ongoing gains in the labor market, coupled with my judgment that longer -term inflation expectations remain reasonably well anchored, serve to bolster my confidence in a return of inflation to 2 percent as the disinflationary effects of declines in energy and import prices wane."
" Committee participants recognize that the future course of the economy is  uncertain, and we take account of both the upside and downside risks around our projections when judging the appropriate stance of monetary policy."
" In particular, recent  monetary policy decisions have reflected  our recognit ion that, with the federal funds rate near zero, we can respond more readily to upside surprises to inflation, economic growth, and employment than to downside shocks."
" This asymmetry suggests that it is appropriate to be more cautious in raising our targe t for the federal funds rate than would be the case  - 10 - if short -term nominal interest rates were appreciably above zero.7  Reflecting these concerns, we have maintained our current policy stance even as the labor market has improved appreciably."
"  However, we  must also take into account the well -documented lags in the effects of monetary policy.8  Were the FOMC to delay the start of policy normalization for too long, we would likely end up having to tighten policy relatively abruptly to keep the economy from s ignificantly overshooting both of our goals."
" And , as I have noted, continuing improvement in the labor market help s strengthen confidence that inflation will move back to our 2 percent objective over the medium term."
"  These data include  a range of indicators regarding the labor market, inflation, and economic activity."
 Evidence that monetary policy affects inflation with a lag comes in part from vector autoregressions in which monetary policy shocks have been identified under a variety of identification assumptions.
" Of course, even after the initial increase in the federal funds rate, monetary policy will remain accommodative."
" In this regard, the Committee anticipates that even after employment a nd inflation are near mandate -consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run ."
 One indication that the neutral funds rate is unusually low is that U.S. economic growth has been quite modest in recent years despite the very low level of the federal funds rate and the Federal Reserve’s very large holdings of longer -term securities.
" Had the neutral rate been running closer to the levels that are thought to have prevailed prior to the financial crisis, current monetary policy settings would have been expected to foster a very rapid economic expansion, with  inflation likely rising significantly above our 2 percent objective."
" Figure 1 employs four macroeconomic m odels used by Federal Reserve staff to estimate the “natural” real rate of interest, a concept closely related to the neutral rate.9  The measures of the natural rate shown in th is figure represent the real  short -term interest rate that would prevail in the absence of frictions that slow the adjustment of wages and prices to changes in the economy; under a variety of assumptions, this interest rate has been shown to promote full employment.10  The shaded blue band represents the range of the estimates of the natural real rate at each point in time."
" These findings are broadly consisten t with those reported in a paper by Thomas Laubach and John Williams, shown in figure 2.11                                                      9 Note that these estimates are in real terms; to obtain estimates of the nominal natural interest rate, one would add a measure of expected inflation."
 Wicksell posited that the natural rate would be equal to the real interest rate that would balance supply and demand absent monetary frictions.
 The recent academic literature draws on this notion to define the natural rate as t he real interest rate that would prevail in the absence of sluggish adjustment in nominal prices and wages.
" In simple models, this interest rate would result in stable prices and full employment; in some more complex models, this interest rate has been found to promote stable inflation and appropriate economic activity, although monetary policymakers face important tradeoffs in such settings."
" For example, it generally rises with expected productivity growth and wit h “preference shocks” that capture households’ desire to consume today rather than save."
" For further discussion of the potential usefulness of the natural rate for monetary policy, see, for example, Barsky, Justiniano, and Melosi (2014) and Cúrdia and others (2015)."
" By contrast, Laubach and Williams (2015) employ a statistical approach that defines the natural rate as one consistent with the economy operating at its full potential once transitory shocks to aggregate supply and demand have abated."
"  Qualitatively, the two measures would be expected to move together  in response to s hocks to productivity growth and preference s so long as those shocks were very persistent."
 - 13 - The marked decline in the neutral federal funds rate after the crisis may be partially attributable to a range of persistent economic headwinds that have weighed on aggregate demand.
" These headwinds have include d tighter underwriting standards and limited  access to credit for some borrowers, deleveraging by many households to reduce debt burdens, contractionary fiscal policy at all levels of government , weak growth abroad coupled with a significant appreciation of the dollar, slower productivity and labor force growth,  and elevated uncertainty about the economic outlook.12  As the restraint from these headwinds further abate s, I anticipate that the neutral  federal fun ds rate will gradually move higher over time."
"  When revising down their estimates of the longer -run federal funds rate, participants have generally cited a lower assessment of the economy’s longer -run potential growth rate as a contributing factor."
 It  is thereby important to emphasize that the actual path of monetary policy will depend on how in coming data affect the evolution of the economic outlook.
" Stronger growth or a more rapid increase in  inflation than we currently anticipate  would suggest that the neutral federal funds rate is rising more quickly than expected, making it appropriate to r aise the federal funds rate more quickly as well; conversely , if the economy disappoints, the federal funds rate would likely rise more slowly."
" Given the persistent shortfall in inflation from our 2 percent objective, the Committee will, of course, carefully monitor actual progress toward our inflation goal as we make decisions over time on the appropriate path for the federal funds rate."
" In closing, let me again thank the Economic Club of Washington for this opportunity to speak about the economy and monetary policy."
 The economy has come a long way toward the FOMC’s objectives of maximum employment and price stability.
