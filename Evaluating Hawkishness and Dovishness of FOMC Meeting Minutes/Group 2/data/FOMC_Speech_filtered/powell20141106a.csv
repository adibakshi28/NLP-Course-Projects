" While we have made significant progress in enlisting central clearing to reduce systemic risks, I will argue that there is a good deal more to do to ensure that the reforms achieve their potential and minimize the p ossibility of unintended and undesirable consequences.1 Prior to the crisis, the then highly opaque market for OTC derivatives grew at an astonishing and unsustainable pace of nearly 25  percent  per annum in a context of relatively light regulation and bilateral clearing.2  With the benefit of hindsight, we know that along with this torrid growth came an unmeasured and underappreciated buildup of risk."
" 2 According to the Bank for International Settlements, the notional amount of OTC derivatives outstandin g grew from $80.3 trillion in December 1998 to $598.1 trillion in December 2008, which corresponds to an annual growth rate of 22.2 percent per year."
" According to public data, roughly 2 0 percent of all credit derivatives and 45 percent of all interest rate derivatives are now centrally cleared --amounts that have grown substantially since 2009, when central clearing of credit derivatives began and the amount of cleared interest rate deriv atives was at roughly one -half of its current level.3  These amounts should continue to grow over time as central clearing and , especially , client clearing requirements take effect in more jurisdictions."
