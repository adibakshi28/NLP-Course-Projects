  Congress assigned the Fed  the dual mandate goals of maximum employment and price stability .
" Today, labor market conditions remain very strong, and the economy  is returning to a better balance between the demand for and supply of workers."
 That gradual slowing has come  in part due to the efforts of the Fed to slow the growth of the economy to help reduce inflation.
" Partly because of that labor force  growth , the unemployment rate has edged up over  the second half of the year, though it remains historically low at 3.9 percent."
" Wage growth remains high but has been gradually moving toward levels that would be more consistent with 2 percent price inflation over time , and real wages are growing again as inflation declines ."
" - 3 - As for price stabili ty, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has a longer -run goal of 2 percent  inflation .2  After running below 2 percent for over a decade, inflation increased sharply in 2021, in the United States and in many other countries around the world."
" High inflation imposes a significant hardship on all households and is especially painful for those le ast able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation."
"  Beginning in early 2022,  we reacted forcefully, raising our policy interest rate and decreasing the size of our balance sheet  to help slow the economy and bring down i nflation."
" Inflation has declined  to 3 percent over the 12 months  ending in October , but after factoring out energy and food prices, which tend to be volatile , what we call “core” inflation is still 3.5 percent,  well above our 2 percent objective."
" Over th e six months ending in October, core inflation ran at an annual rate of 2.5 percent, and while the lower inflation readings of the past few months are welcome, that progress must continue if we are to reach our 2 percent objective."
 High inflation initiall y emerged from a collision between very strong demand and pandemic -constrained supply.
" The normalization  of supply and demand conditions has played a critical role in the disinflation so far, as has the substantial tightening of monetary policy and overal l financial conditions over the past two years.3  The strong actions we have taken have  2 The F OMC judges that inflation at the rate of 2 percent, as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, is most consistent over the longer run with the Federal Reserve’s sta tutory mandate."

" Monetary policy is thought to affect economic conditions with a lag, and the full effects of our tightening have likely no t yet been felt."
" The forcefulness of our response to inflation also helped maintain the Fed’s hard -won credibility, ensuring that the public’s expectations of future inflation remain  wellanchored."
" Having come so far so quickly, the FOMC is moving forwar d carefully, as the risks of under - and over -tightening are becoming more balanced.4  As the demand - and supply -related effects of the pandemic continue to unwind, uncertainty about the outlook for the economy is unusually elevated."
" Like most forecasters , my colleagues and I anticipate that growth in spending and output will slow over the next year, as the effects of the pandemic and the reopening fade and as restrictive monetary policy weigh s on aggregate demand.5  The FOMC is strongly committed to brin ging inflation down to 2 percent over time, and to keeping policy restrictive until we are confident that inflation is on a path to that objective."
"4 Beyond the uncertainty in the economic outlook, we face uncertainty about the precise level of monetary policy restraint and the duration of the lags with which monetary tightening affects economic activity and especially inflation; for further discussion see Jerome H."
