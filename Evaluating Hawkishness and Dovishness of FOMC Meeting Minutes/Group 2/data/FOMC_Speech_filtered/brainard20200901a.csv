"It is an honor to be here with Ben Bernanke and Jan et Yellen , who pioneered the original Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy in 2012."
"Key Longer -Run Changes in the Economy  Three related features of the economy’s new normal called for  the reassessment of the Committee’s longer -run goals and strategy.2  First, the equilibrium interest rate  has fallen to low levels , which implies  a large decline in how much we can cut interest rates to support the economy."

" The reduced  scope to cut the interest rate  could increase the frequency and duration of periods when the policy rate is pinned close to zero , unemployment is elevated, and inflation is below target."
" In turn, the greater likelihood  of extended periods of low inflation at the lower bound  risks erodin g inflation expectations and further compress ing the scope for cutting the interest rate ."
" The risk here is a downward spiral where the scope for cutting the interest rate  gets compressed even further, the lower bound binds even more frequently, and it bec omes increasingly difficult to move inflation expectations and inflation back up to target."
" Second, underlying trend inflation appears to be  somewhat below the Committee’s 2 percent objective, according to various statistical filters.4  The near decade of inflation  persistently short of 2 percent creates the  risk that households and businesses come to expect inflation to run persistently below target and change their behavior in a way that fulfills that expectation, which greatly complicates the task of monetary policy."
" While inflation expectations are difficult to measure with precision, some market -based and surveybased indicators show  signs  of a downward drift ."

   - 3 - inflation expectations are wellanchored at 2 percent is critical to achieving  target inflation.
" Finally, the sensitivity of price inflation to labor market tightness is very low relative to earlier decades , which  is what economists mean when they say that the Phillips  curve is flat.5  A flat Phillips curve has the important advantage of  allow ing employment to continue expanding for longer  without generating inflationary pressures , thereby providing job oppor tunities to  people that might not otherwise have them ."
 It also means that it is harder to achieve our 2 percent inflation objective on a sustained basis  when inflation expectations  have drifted below 2 percent .
" First, the statement defines the statutory maximum level of employment  as a broad -based and inclusive goal and eliminate s the reference to a numerical estimate of the longer -run normal unemployment  rate.6  The longstanding presumption that accommodation should be re duced preemptively when the unemployment rate nears the neutral  rate in anticipation of high inflation that is unlikely to materialize  risks  an unwarranted loss of opportunity for many Americans."

" 6 In the FOMC’ s Summary of Economic Projections  (SEP) , the longer -run unemployment r ate represents  each participant’ s assessment of the rate to which the unemployment rate would be expected to converge under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy."
"  - 4 - of Economic Projections ( SEP)  estimate of  the normal unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of 2015 supported a further  decrease of 3½ percentage point s in the Black unemployment rate  and of 2¼ percentage point s in the Hispanic unemployment rate, as well as a n increase of  nearly 3 percentage point s in the labor force participation rate of prime -age women ."
" It also  created conditions for the entry of a further 3½ million prime -age Americans into the labor force, a movement of nearly 1 million people out of longterm unemployment, and opportunities for 2 million involuntary part -time workers to secure full -time jobs.7  Beyond that , had the changes to monetary policy goals and strategy we made in the new s tatement been in place several years ago, it is lik ely that accommodation would have been withdrawn later, and the gains would have been greater ."
"Instead of an aggregate “normal” unemployment rate, t he Committee’s  commitment to defining the maximum level of employment as a broad -based  and inclusive goal , together with our continued commitment to consider  a wide range of indicators , may be particularly significant for the groups that are most vulnerable to employment  fluctuations .8  Both resea rch and experience suggest the groups that face the greatest structural challenges  in the labor market  are likely to be the first to experience layoffs during downturns and the last to experience employment gains during rec overies."
"  Research by the Federal Reserve Board staff  finds that unemployment rates, as well as                                                  7 These numbers are based on the observed changes in various aggregate labor  market statistics between the fourth quarter of 2015 and the fourth quarter of 2019—the last quarter of data unaffected by the COVID -19 pandemic."

" - 5 - patterns of job loss and labor force entry and exit, are  more cyclically sensitive for B lacks and Hispanics th an for whites, and observable worker characteristics can explain very little of the se differentials.9  A similar observation  was one of the  key takeawa ys from the  Fed Listens sessions we held around the country.10  Juan Salgado , chancellor of the City Colle ges of Chicago, described how last year’s tight labor market was finally giving his students, who are largely B lack and Latinx, the opportunity to apprentice with local businesses in jobs that historically have not been open to them.11  Moreover , earnings from wages are particularly important for these groups, who have large and persistent wealth gaps and derive a smaller share of their  income from financia l asset  holdings or from business ownership.12 Second, to address the downward bias to infla tion associated with the proximity  to the effective lower bound, the s tatement adopts a flexible inflation averaging strategy that seeks to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time in order to ensure longer -term inflation expectations are well a nchored at 2 percent ."

" By committing to seek inflation that averages 2 percent over time, FAIT  means that appropriate monetary policy would likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for a time to compensate for a period, such as the present, when it has been persistently below 2 percent."
"13  Consistent with this , I would expect the C ommittee to accommodate rather than offset inflationary pressures moderately above 2 percent , in a process of opportunistic reflation."
"Flexible  average inflation targeting  is a pragmatic way  to implement  a makeup strategy , which is  essential to arrest any  downward drift in inflation expectations .14  While a formal average inflation target (AIT) rule is appealing in theory , there are likely to be  communications and implementation challenges in practice related to  time -consistency  and the  mechanical nature of such rules."
"  In my mind, the commitment to undertake a review of the new strategy and goals in roughly five  years is a  necessary  com plement to the flexib ility embe dded in the  new inflation averaging strategy ."
" Since the Committee is  adopting  a new  approach , it is                                                  13 See Lael Brainard (2019), “ Federal Reserve Review of Monetary Policy Strategy, Tools, and Communications:  Some Preliminary Views, ” speech delivered at the presentation of the 2019 William F."

" As such , the five -year review will provide a vital checkpoint to see how well flexible average inflation targeting  is working and, in my thinking, provide some insights into an appropriate makeup period."
" Whereas previously it sought to mitigate  deviations of employment and inflation  from  their targets  in either direction , the Committee  will now seek “to mitigate shortfalls of employment from the Committee’s assessment of its maximum level and deviations of inflation from its longerrun goal .”  This change implies that the Committee effectively  will set  monetary policy to minimize the welfare costs of shortfalls of employment from its maximum  and not preemptively withdraw support based on a historically steeper Phillips curve t hat is not currently in evidence and inflation that is correspondingly much less likely to materialize.16  Consistent with this , the statement  drops language about a “balanced approach”  that might be interpreted as calling for the preemptive withdrawal of accommodation and replaces it with  a more accurate description of how we pursue our dual -mandate goals in parallel."
"                                                  16 As we heard consistently in the Fed Listens  events,  in many circumstances, consumers and businesses can see very low inflation as having benefits at the individual level."
" In contrast, a t the aggregate level, inflation that is too low can make it very challenging for monetary policy to cut the short -term in terest rate sufficiently to support the economy ef fectively in a downturn."
"        - 8 - Fourth and finally, the s tatement codifies the key lesson from the Global F inancial Crisis —that financial stability  is necessary for the achievement of our statutory goals of maximum employment and price stability."
 The same changes in the macroeconomic environment that prompted our monetary policy review have important implicati ons for financial stability.
" Historically, when the Phillips curve was steeper, inflation tended to rise as the economy heated up."
" The rise in inflation would prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates to restrictive levels, which would have the effect of tightening finan cial conditions more broadly."
" In contrast, t he past few cycles did not see this kind of behavior, and in each case, financial imbalances, rather than  goods and services inflation , were notably elevated at the onset of the downtur n."
"  With a flat Phillips curve and low inflation , the Committee  would have to sustain the federal funds rate below the neutral rate for much longer in order to push inflation back to target sustainably."
" The resulting expectation of lower -forlonger interest rates, along with sustained high rates of resource utilization, is conducive to increasing risk appetite, reach -foryield behavior , and incentives for leverage —which can boost financial imbala nces as an expansion extends."
" In this way, t he combination of a low neutral rate, a flat Phillips curve, and low underlying inflation can lead to more  cyclical v olatility in  asset prices."
" With financial stability risks more tightly linked to the business cycle, it is vital to use macroprudential as well as standard prudential  tools  as the first line  of defense in order to allow monetary policy to remain focused on achieving maximum employment and 2 percent average inflation .17                                                  17 See Lael Brainard (2019), “Financial Stability,”  statement  before the House Financial Services Subcommittee on Consumer Protection and Financial Institutions, U.S. House of Representatives, September 25, https://www.federalres erve.gov/newsevents/testimony/brainard20190925a.htm ."
 - 9 - Supporting the Recovery  The Committee’s new s tatement on goals  and s trategy will put us in a stronger position to support a full and timely recovery in employment and average inflation of 2 percent.
"Encouragingly, the housing sector has rebounded strongly from its initial decline , supported by historically low mortgage rates, and consumer spending on goods has held up well, in part reflecting  earlier fiscal support .18  At the s ame time, however, the strong pace of  improvem ent in employment in May and June , which w as importantly driven by recall hiring out of temporary layoffs, appear s to have slowed .19  And on the inflation front, despite some bounceback in July,  inflation remains weaker than precrisis, and it is likely to take some time to return  closer to target.20  Looking ahead, the economy continues to face considerable uncertainty associated with the vagaries of the COVID -19 pandemic, and risks are tilted to the downside ."
" 19 After falling by 22.2 million over March and April, nonfarm payroll employment increased by 7.5 million over May and June and by 1.8 million in July."
"  Furthermore, various highfrequency indicators tracked by Federal Reserve Board staff —including initial cl aims for unemployment insurance and  employment in small businesses —suggest that the pace of improvement  in the labor market has slowed."
"  - 10 - With the recovery likely to face COVID -19related headwinds for some time, in coming months, it will be important for monetary policy to pivot from stabilization to accommodation."
" As we move to the next phase of monetary policy, we will be guided by the Committee’s new goals and strategy statement ."
" It will be important to provide the requisite accommodation  to achieve maximum employment and average inflation  of 2 percent over time, following persistent underperformance."
