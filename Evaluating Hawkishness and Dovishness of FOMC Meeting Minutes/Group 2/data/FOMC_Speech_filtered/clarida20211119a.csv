"For release on delivery  12:15 p.m. EST (9:15 a.m. PST)  November 19, 2021         Perspectives on Global Monetary Policy Coordination, Cooperation, and Correlation    Remarks by   Richard H ."
"Clarida   Vice Chair   Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at  “Macroeconomic Policy and Global Economic Recovery”  2021 Asia Economic Policy Conference , sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco Center for Pacific Basin Studies   San Francisco , California  (via webcast)         November 19, 2021   In my remarks today, I would like to offer some perspectives on global monetary policy correlation and what it can—and  cannot —reveal  about the prevalence and value of global monetary policy coordination or, in the limit, binding global monetary cooperation.1  In both the Global Financial Crisis  (GFC)  and the Global Pandemic Collapse (GPC) , major central banks around the world responded by cutting policy rates to, and then keeping them at , their effective lower bounds  (ELBs) ; by increasing their balance sheets through ambitious and expansive large -scale asset purchase and lending programs ; and  by offering forward guidance —both Delphic and Odyssean—on the stance of their future monetary policie s.2  As these examples make clear, we certainly do observe that national monetary policies are often correlated, and such examples are not confined to recent experience."
" Indeed, the international monetary economics literature abounds with historical and empirical studies of correlated global monetary policy cycles, not to mention the evident secular downtrend in global monetary policy rates observed in recent decades."
" Delphic forward guidance forecasts macroeconomic performance and likely monetary policy actions under that forecast, whereas Odyssean forward guidance publicl y commits the FOMC to a future action."
"    To begin with the theory, it ha s long been appreciated that in the sort s of economic models used by  central banks around the world, the calibrated gains to international monetary policy cooperation are found to be rather modest relative to a status quo ante in which each country runs a sensible policy, taking as given the sensible policies of the other countries."
" Today I will make a somewhat different, and less often discussed , case questioning formal global monetary policy cooperation —that, in practice, adopting it could plausibly erode central bank credibility and public support for central bank instrument independence."
"  3 While adopting the euro—and, more broadly, joining a currency union—is the ultimate binding commitment to cooperative monetary policy, the focus of my remarks today is on countries that are not members of a currency union."
"   International monetary policy coordination, which I think of as including the sharing of information and analysis among central banks regarding the evolution of their individual economies as well as the considerations that govern the setting of their policy instruments —in other words , information about their policy reaction functions —can, and in my observation certainly does , enhance the design and effectiveness of monet ary policy execution for each country."
"But while international monetary policy coordination may enhance the efficiency of monetary policy execution, I am skeptical that in practice there are additional material, reliable,  and robust gains that would flow from a formal regime of binding monetary policy cooperation, at least among major G -7 economies with flexible exchange rates, open capital accounts, and central bank mandates that include price stability."
 The reason is that  there can be global externalities to monetary policy that create such theoretical gains to cooperation.
" However, as Clarida, Gal í, and Gertler (2002) , among others , have shown in the context of central banks with domestic pr icestability mandates, to achieve the theoretical gains to international monetary policy cooperation, policy in each  country must be set with reference to an index of inflation in all  countries party  to the cooperative agreement."
" But in practice, no sovereign central bank outsources its policy to an E xcel spreadsheet, and , moreover, best -practice policy rules incorporate inputs —such as the neutral rate of interest or expected inflation —that are unobserved and time varying and thus difficult to monitor."
" For example, the Fede ral Reserve is mandated to pursue policies that achieve “maximum employment and price stability.”  The European Central Bank ( ECB)  is mandated by treaty to pursue price stability but also has a secondary mandate to contribute to achieving the objectives of  the European Union, which include balanced economic growth and full employment."
"government’s target of 2 percent inflation, but its secondary objective is to support the government ’s policy aims, including those for employment, growth, and—more recently —environmental sustainability."
" Because these obligations can , and sometimes do, require central banks to make a tradeoff—for example , in the U nited States,  between inflation and employment in the presence of supply shocks —defining the objective tha t a cooperative agreement would choose to maximize would be a formidable  task."
" Simply stated and in the context of a price -stability mandate for each central bank, the problem —as I see it —is the threat to the credibility of the central bank, the challenges to central bank communication, and the resulting potentia l loss of support for its policy actions from the public when the policy choices that would be required by binding monetary policy cooperation react not only to home inflation deviations from target, but also to deviations of foreign inflation from target."
" In theoretical models, the commitment to the inflation target is just assumed to be perfect and credible, but in practice , credibility appears to be a function of central bank communication and of the policies actually implemented pushing inflation towar d—and, in the absence of shocks, keeping inflation at —target."
" I suspect that, in practice, central banks would have a hard time maintaining credibility and independence as well as communicating a policy that raised home interest rates aggressively not bec ause home inflation is too high but because foreign inflation is!  While, perhaps for these reasons, we do not have many confirmed sightings of genuine binding monetary policy cooperation, we do observe many examples of monetary policy correlation  (see fig ure 1) ."
" In the “home” country, the optimal inflationtargeting monetary policy can be written as a Taylor -type rule:  𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡=𝑟𝑟𝑡𝑡+(1+ 𝜆𝜆𝛼𝛼)𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡,  where r t is the “neutral” interest rate in the home country consistent with price stability and trend growth and π t is inflation in the home country."
 The ratio λ/α  captures the extent to which the home central bank trades off its inflation and gross domestic product  (GDP ) objectives when they are in conflict.
 The parameter α indexes the priority the central bank places on stabilizing GDP growth relative to its trend path.
" When α is large, the central bank leans against high inflation less aggressively than it wo uld were α small."
" With an integrated global capital market, the neutral policy rate at home is a function of trend GDP growth at home as well as expected foreign GDP growth:  𝑟𝑟𝑡𝑡= 2𝐸𝐸𝑡𝑡{Δ𝑦𝑦� 𝑡𝑡+1}+ 𝐸𝐸𝑡𝑡{Δ𝑦𝑦𝑡𝑡+1∗}."
"Now, to the extent the foreign central bank has a comparative advantage in tracking or forecasting foreign output growth—which , of course , it should , since such growth will depend on the foreign central bank’s monetary policy—sharing this information with the home central bank can improve that institution’s  estimate of the home equilibrium real interest rate and thus the effectiveness of its policy rule in meeting its domestic objectives."
"The ratio λ/α*  captures the extent to which the foreign central bank trades off its inflation and GDP objectives when they are in conflict, and note that this tradeoff may be  different than that of the home central bank."
" For example, even if home and foreign inflation rates and trend growth rates are uncorrelated across countries, sensible monetary policies can be correlated across countries if neutral policy rates are correlated , as they appear to be in the data (see figure 2, which is based on Holston, Laubach, and Williams, 2017)."
"A recent working paper , Ferreira and Shousha (2021) , models the determinants of the neutral policy rate in the U nited S tates and includes in the empirical specification an index of global productivity growth and demographic trends."
 Their empirical estimates attribute 85 basis points of the decline in U.S. neutral real interest rates since 2000 to global spillovers from the slo wdown in global trend growth and demographic trends.
" So policy correlation can be an outcome of noncooperative monetary policy operating in an integrated global capital market and not evidence , in and of itself , of policy coordination, let alone cooperati on."
" Before continuing, I consider briefly how monetary policy would differ under binding cooperation in the simple example sketched out earlier ."
" Under international monetary policy cooperation, the policy rate is set according to    𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡= 𝑟𝑟𝑡𝑡+�1+ 𝜆𝜆𝛼𝛼�𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡+ 13�1+ 𝜆𝜆𝛼𝛼�𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡∗."
" So, intuitively, while policy in the home country does place  more weight on home inflation when setting the interest rate, it also reacts to foreign inflation as well, as I discussed earlier."
  Consider the case with home inflation high  and foreign inflation low.
" As can be seen from the preceding equation, the optimal policy under cooperation calls for the home interest rate to be lower—more accommodative— than it would be in the absence  of cooperation."
" In practice, the home central ban k’s credibility as an inflation targeter to satisfy i ts domestic price -stability mandate might well suffer if it failed to respond aggressively to high domestic inflation because of, say, serious deflation abroad."
"  Monetary Policy Spillovers Flow in Both Directions    There is a vast literature that documents the existence of international spillovers from U.S. monetary policy, especially to emerging markets  (EMs) ."
monetary policy.
" Their key finding, illustrated in figure 3, is that Federal Reserve policy rate surprises attributed  to stronger U.S. growth generally have only moderate spillovers to EM  financial conditions, whereas U .S."
policy rate changes attributed to U.S. inflationary pressures trigger more substantial spillovers to EM financial conditions.
"monetary policy s hifts depends  on a country’s macroeconomic vulnerability —as measured by inflation, current account deficit, international reserves, government debt, external debt, and private -sector credit growth , with more vulnerable EM countries experiencing larger spillovers from U .S."

"monetary policy, can and do propagate globally (see, for example , Miranda -Agrippino and Rey, forthcoming ), the evidence suggests that causality can and does run in both directions."
monetary policy.
 The Mexican peso crisis of 1994–95 and the Asian fi nancial crisis of 1997 –98 resulted in substantial declines in economic activity in emerging markets but had only a modest effect on the U.S. economy.
" In more recent times, global shocks have also been consequential for U.S. economic prospects and monetary policy."
" But despite the drop in Treasury yields, overall financial conditions in the United States tightened, weighing on aggregate demand."
" U.S. monetary policy responded to these global “ headwinds ,” helping stave off actual contractions of U.S. activity."
aggregate demand.
The Federal Reserve and ECB Framework Reviews  The monetary policy framework reviews conducted by the Federal Reserve and the ECB provide another example of monetary pol icy co rrelation .
"  Federal Reserve S ystem launched a review of its monetary policy strategy, tools, and communication practices."
" A key  motivation for the Fed’s review  as well as the ECB’s review  was the substantial decline in estimates of the neutral real interest rate, r*, that, over the longer run, is consistent with price  stability ."
" This decline has critical implications for monetary policy because it leaves central banks with less conventional policy space to offset adverse shocks  to aggregate demand .5 As discussed in Clarida (2020), t he Fed’s  review , from the outset, buil t on three pillars:  a series of Fed Listens events, a flagship research conference, and a series of rigorous briefings for the Committee commencing in July 2019 and running through January 2020.6  While o ur plans to conclude the review earlier in 2020 w ere, like so many things, delayed by the arri val of the pandemic , in August 2020, the Federal Reserve did announce, with unanimous support, an evolution of its monetary policy strategy to flexible  average inflation targeting .7    Similar to the Federal Reserve, the ECB launched a review of its monet ary policy strategy  in January 2020 .8  Since the time of its previous strategy review in 2003, like the Fed, the ECB observed profound structural changes in the global and euroarea economies that have driven down neutral interest rates and increased the incidence and duration of episodes in which nominal policy interest rates are close to the ELB ."
" So the ECB’s  review sought to adapt its monetary policy to the current economic environment  5 For a detailed discuss ion of the elements that motivated the launch of the review, see Clarida (2020, 2021 ) and Powell (2020)."
7 The Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy is available on the Board's website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/review -ofmonetary -policy -strategy -tools -andcommunications -statement -onlonger -rungoals -monetary -policy -strategy.htm .
" In July 2021, with unanimous support from its Governing Council, the ECB announced its new strategy.10  Key elements of that strategy are a symmetric 2 percent inflation target, a view that the ELB  requires especially forceful or persistent monetary policy measures to keep inflation expectations from drifting lower, and the affirmation that the full range of measures it has used in recent years will remain in its toolkit."
 The similarities in the two framework evolutions are due to the fact that powerful common global forces are driving down neutral policy rates and limiting the effective ness of monetary policy in downturns to offset declines in aggregate demand.
" This asymmetry of policy effectiveness caused by the ELB imparts a secular downward bias to inflation that, if not offset, could de -anchor inflation expectations below the centra l bank’s price -stability objectives."
"   Conclusion In this speech, I have offered some perspectives on global monetary policy correlation and what it can —and cannot —reveal about the prevalence and value of global monetary policy coordina tion or, in the limit, binding global monetary cooperation."
" But I also observe that international monetary policy coordination, defined as including the sharing of information and analysis among central banks regarding the evolution of their individual economies and information about their policy reaction functions, can enhance the design and effectiveness of monetary policy execution for each country."
