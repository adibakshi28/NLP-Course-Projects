"  For a fire sale to have the sort of welfare effects that create a role for regulation, the reduced price in the fire sale has to hurt somebody other than the original party making the leverage decision, and this adverse impact of price has to run through something like a collateral constraint, whereby a lowered price actually reduces, rather than increases, the third party’s demand for the asset.4  So if hedge fund A buys an asset -backed security and finances it largely with collateraliz ed borrowing, A’s fire selling of the security will create an externality in the conventional sense only if the reduced price and impaired collateral value lower the ability of hedge funds B and C to borrow against the same security, and therefore force th em to involuntarily liquidate their positions in it as well.5 The market failure in this case is not simply the fact that this downward spiral                                                  4 An alternative mechanism that works similarly is when the third party is a regulated intermediary and mark -tomarket losses reduce its capital ratios, and again force it to involuntarily sell assets in the face of falling prices."

 This fragility stems in part from their capital structures —the fact that they  - 16 - issue stable -value demandable liabilities with no capital buffe r or other explicit loss -absorption capacity —which make them highly vulnerable to runs by their depositors.
