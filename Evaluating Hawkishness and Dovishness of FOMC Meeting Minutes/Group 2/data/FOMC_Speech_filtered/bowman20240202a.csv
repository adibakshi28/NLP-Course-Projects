"Before I delve into the “ future ” of banking, I want to spend a moment on the “ present ” of monetary policy and the economy."
 Inflation readings over the past six months i ndicate that the Committee’s past policy actions are having the intended effect of reducing inflationary pressures.
"   The most recent 12 -month readings through December for total and core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation came in at 2.6 and 2.9 percent respectively, the first time both measures have been below 3 percent since the spring of 2021."
 I view the slowdown in inflation readings over recent months as encouraging.
" In addition to this progress on inflation, economic  1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee."
" Further evidence of economic strength showed in the advance report of fourth quarter real gross domestic product (GDP) with an increase of 3.3 percent, partly ref lecting ongoing strength in consumer spending, and also in today’s employment report with an acceleration in job gains to a very strong pace of around 350,000 for both December and January."
 The unemployment rate remained low at 3.7 percent.
" This appears to reverse the trend from last year, when the average pace of job gains slowed and the labor force participation rate rose through November, a sign that labor market demand and supply may have been coming into better balance."
" That said, today’s jobs repor t with markedly stronger job growth and a labor force participation that has retraced some of its earlier gains suggests that progress has stalled over the past two months."
"  Considering these developments, I voted to maintain the policy rate at its current level  while we continue to monitor the incoming data and assess the implications for the inflation and economic outlook."
 My baseline outlook is that inflation will decline further with the policy rate held at the current level.
" Should the incoming data continue to indicate that inflation is moving sustainably toward our 2 percent goal, it will eventually become appropriate to gradually lower our policy rate to prevent monet ary policy from becoming overly restrictive."
 And a number of important upside inflation risks remain.
"There is also the risk that conti nued easing in financial conditions could add momentum to demand, stalling any further progress in lowering inflation, or even causing inflation to reaccelerate."
" Finally, there is a risk that continued labor market tightness could lead to persistently high core services inflation."
" Today’s labor market - 3 -  data, which indicated a pickup in wage inflation in recent months, suggests ongoing elevated wage growth as some businesses continue to report above -average wage increases to compensate for inflation."
"  Given these risks, and the general uncertainty regarding the economic outlook, I will continue to watch the data closely —especially the inflation data revisions next week and upcoming inflation reports —as I assess the appropriate path of monetary policy."
" The frequency and extent of data revisions over the past few years, as illustrated in today’s employment report, make the task of predicting how the economy will evolve even more challenging, and I will remain cautious in my approach to considering future changes in the stance of policy."
 Reducing our policy rate too soon could result in requiring further future policy rate increases to return inflation to 2 percent in the longer run.
   It is important to note that monetary policy is not on a preset course.
" While the current stance of monetary policy appears to be  sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to 2 percent over time, I remain willing to raise the federal funds rate at a future meeting should the incoming data indicate that progress on inflation has stalled or reversed."
 Restoring price stability is essential for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run.
" Some t raditional risks —like interest rate risk  and liquidity risk —have become a higher priority concern for banks and regulators , while other risks —like cyber security  and fraud —continue to evolve and pose challenges."
" The Risk of Complacency  Banks have an obligation to manage all material risks, and yet we see that even with traditional risks —interest rate and liquidity risk, for example —long periods of calm, such as those that followed the prolonged period of low interest rates following the 2008 financial crisis, can lull both bankers and regulators into a state of complacency."
" Likewise, the persistently low interest rates that were a legacy of the post2008 financial crisis period led some to chase yield in their securities investment portfolios , overinvesting in fixedrate, longterm securities relying on the  belief that longterm interest rates would remain low  in perpetuity."
" Having a concentrated, monoline business model  and experiencing rapid growth are both well -known risks  to ongoing viabilit y, even though the particulars may vary over time."
" Banking Changes Bring New Risk s Of course, even with a relentless focus on the known risks  that affect the banking system —credit risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, cyber risk, and others —we also know that as the banking system evolves, the risks evolve as well."
" But with th is growth comes additional  risk, including limitations on the ability to detect and prevent fraud."
