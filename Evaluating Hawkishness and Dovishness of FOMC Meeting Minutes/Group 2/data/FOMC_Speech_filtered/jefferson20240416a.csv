"For release on delivery  9:00 a.m.  EDT  April 16, 2024          Economic Uncertainty  and the E volution of Monetary Policymaking     Remarks by   Philip N."
"Jefferson   Vice Chair   Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at the  International Research Forum on Monetary Policy   Washington, D.C.         April 16, 2024    Thank you, Matteo."
 I t is my pleasure to welcome you to the 1 3th International Research Forum on Monetary Policy.
" As a result, I know from firsthand experience that understanding the main sources of uncertainty and how b est to make monetary policy decisions in the presence of uncertainty are crucial to policymaking."
" First, I will review a few historical examples of how economic thinking on monetary policymaking in the presence of uncertainty has evolved."
" Second, I will consider lessons learned from these examples  that could influence how monetary policymakers think  about the policy choices the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) faces currently.1   The 1960s to the 1980s  In the 1960s, during the heyday of Keynesian macroeconomics, researchers widely believed that monetary policymakers faced a long -run tradeoff between inflation and unemployment , and that the tradeoff could be calibrat ed to keep unemployment indefinitely low at an acceptable cost in terms of higher inflation."
" - 2 -  There were contrarians , of course , most notably  Milton Friedman, who highlighted the necessity  of monetary policymakers to consider what they don’t  know in their decisionmaking  process  (Friedman , 1968) ."
" Friedman’s statement that monetary policy works with “long and variable lags” was , among other things,  an argument against policymakers trying to finetune the level of economic activity."
"  In recognition of policymakers’ limited knowledge of short -run economic relationships , Friedman advocated the use of si mple rules for monetary policy , such as the kpercent money growth rule."
" He argued that rules that focused on mone tary growth and that eschewed direct feedback on macroeconomic variables would work reasonably well, on average, and avoid the hubris  of fine -tuning policy in a dynamic and uncertain world."
" History proved Friedman right in his take on  the importance of uncertainty, even if his prescription of a kpercent money growth rule fared less well."
" During roughly the same period when  Friedman authored his famous presidential address to the American Economic Association disput ing the purported long -run tradeoff between inflation and unemployment, William Brainard published an influential  paper on the implications of uncertainty."
 Brainard (1967) argued that uncertainty about the power of monetary policy implie d that policy should respond more cautiously to shocks than would be the case if this uncertainty did not exist.
" The unemployment rate was below what many analysts at the time judged to be its natural rate, and many FOMC participants and others were forecasting growth above the economy’s potential."
" Chairman Alan Greenspan, however, sus pected that technological advances and other forces were fostering a “new economy” of sustained high productivity growth that would allow a period of persistently low unemployment without generating inflationary pressure."
" Chairman Greenspan repeated this message as inflation fell  3 An incomplete list of the early contributions includes Prescott (1972), Chow (197 6), Craine and Havenner (1977 ), and Kendrick (1982)."
"  - 4 -  from above 2 percent in 1996 to below 2 percent in 1997 and 1998 while the economy added 9.3 million jobs, and the FOMC raised the federal funds rate just once.4      Around the same time, there was an explosion of interest in simple policy rules  for monetary policy, beginning, in most people’s reckoning, with the rule  John  Taylor (1993 ) published in the early 1990s ."
" These simple feedback  rules , which specify how central banks’ policy instrument would respond to the state of the economy,  differed from their predecessors by replac ing monetary aggregates as the instrument of monetary policy with a short -term policy interest rate."
" This research  embraced the message that restricting feedback to a small number of key macroeconomic variables  would result in more robust outcomes than adhering to the prescriptions of, say, optimal -control policies, which in essence imposed feedback on all aspects of these  model s.5  Whether much of the robustness gains of simple rules can be realized when central banks only use such rules as “guides” for monetary policy is a topic worthy of further research.6  4 The estimate of 9.3 million jobs uses total nonfarm seasonally adjusted numbers from the St. Louis Fed FRED database ( https://fred.stlouisfed.org ; PAYEMS series) and takes the difference between the December 1998 and January 1996 numbers."
 Svensson (2003) is a critique of the use of all simple monetary policy rules —sometimes  referred to as instrument rules —as opposed to what are called targeting rules .
"  She went on to argue that  simple  rules “by no means deserve the ‘last word’” on guidance for monetary policy, in part because they do not fully account for factors that might be idiosyncratic, such as risk -management concerns."
" That speech introduced the Fed’s optimal -control simulations to the public as an alternative source of guidance for monetary policy that could be used alongside that of simple monetary policy rules, together with judgment."
" Since 2017, the Monetary Policy Report  has discusse d simple monetary policy rules and their limitations."
" One useful finding was that gradualism  in policy setting , in the form of a sizable weight on the lagged policy rate  in the policy rule,  is helpful for facilitating learnability.7  In any event, the literature on learning in macroeconomics extended  the dimension of uncertainty for monetary policymakers from the cross  section of candidate models to the time dimension of any given model."
" Bullard and Mitra (2002) established the benefits of inertia in monetary policy for making a wider set of models “Estable, ” meaning the process of least -squares learning leads to a unique and stable equilibrium."
 That  realization  changes the way you think about monetary policy.
" As many of you know, econometricians have found  sizable declines in recent decades in the response of inflation to the unemployment rate .8  Taken at face value, these declines  in the slope of the Phillips curve have important implications for the optimal conduct of monetary policy."
" Some researchers  argue that the apparent decline in the response to slack in  the Phillips curve could be a manifestation of the improved control of inflation by the  central bank .9  That is, policymakers could be “victims of their own success” in the sense  that good performance in controlling inflation over the Great Moderation period may have weakened the information content of the data."
" One case of perennial interest to central bankers is inflation persistence where the Bayesian approach, the ambiguity aversion approach, and its close cousin, robust control, all tend to lead to  policy that is stronger than the certainty equivalent case to forestall the possibility of inflationary forces becoming embedded in inflation expectations.12  Another case is that of crisis periods."
" With u ncertain inflation persistence, the Bayesian and   - 8 -  The Global  Financial Crisis  Take, for example, the Global Financial Crisis of 2008."
" During this period, the tension between caution, on the one hand, and vigorous action, on the other, as a way to  conduct monetary policy in the face of uncertainty was evident."
" Inflation, however, was rising over that period."
" It was a decision that weighed the upside risks to inflat ion and inflation expectations with the downside risks to economic growth.14  In September 2008, the circumstances changed  ambiguity aversion approaches lead to a policy that is stronger than the certainty equivalent case because a symmetric distribution for inflation persistence results in asymmetric (downward -skewed) distributions for economic outcomes when evaluated for the  certainty equivalent policy."
 Adam and Woodford (20 12) show that uncertainty regarding the data generating process for inflation in the New Keynesian model retains as the optimal policy the same general form as in the standard model but with a more aggressive response to inflation.
"14 See paragraph 4 of the June 2008 FOMC statement , which , in explaining the FOMC’s decision to keep its target for the federal funds rate at 2 percent at that meeting , noted , “Although downside risks to growth remain, they appear to have diminished somewhat, and the upside risks to inflation and inflation expectations have increased.”  See also the minutes of the June 24–25, 2008 , FOMC Meeting , in particular the summary of the Committee’s discussion on downside risks to growth and upside risks to inflation on pages 7 and 8."
" Second, while simple monetary policy rules are appealing for several reasons, rigid adherence to the prescriptions of simple rules is unwarranted."
" Third, in the presence of a high degree of uncertainly, policymaker s benefit from a  15 The literature on the implications of the effective lower bound on nominal interest rates  for the conduct on monetary policy  is large and includes Reifschneider and Williams (2000)."
" Current Situation  Reflecting on  the situation we are facing today , over the past year, inflation has come down significantly but is still running above the FOMC ’s 2 percent goal."
" In March, headline personal consumption expenditures  (PCE)  inflation was 2.7 percent over the past 12 months based on the Federal Reserve’s staff estimates."
" Core PCE inflation, which excludes the volatile food and energy components , stood at 2.8 percent; a year ago, it was 4.8 percent."
" While we have seen considerable progress in lowering inflation , the job of sustainably restor ing 2 percent inflation is not yet done."
" Real GDP growth in the fourth quarter of 2023 was 3.4 percent, and I expect first -quarter economic growth to slow down but remain solid as indicated by the solid  growth in retail sales in  March and February ."
 Recent readings on both job gains and inflation have come in higher than expected.
 And the inflation data over the past three months were above the low readings in the second half of last year.
" My baseline outlook continues to be that inflation will decline further , with the policy rate held steady at its current level, and that the labor market will remain strong , with labor demand and supply continuing to rebalance."
" Of course, the outlook is still quite uncertain, and if incoming data suggest that inflation is more persistent than I  - 11 -  currently expect it to be, it will be appropriate to hold in place the current restrictive stance of policy for longer."
  I am fully committed to get ting inflation back to 2 percent.
" Conclusion  I would like to conclude by saying that i n this environment of heightened uncertainty, it is increasingly important to comprehend what is driving uncertainty and how monetary policy might play a role in limiting the negative impact of uncertainty on businesses, households, and financial markets."
