"  For release on delivery  3:20 p.m. E ST (12:20 p.m. P ST)  March 1, 2024          Disinflation w ithout a Rise in Unemployment?"
"  My topic today is the Federal Reserve’s dua l mandate of maximum employment and stable prices —and , specifically, the tradeoffs that sometimes arise when pursuing these two objectives."
" This distinction is an important one , especially  when considering the Federal Open Market Committee  (FOMC) ’s recent progress in reducing high inflation while the labor market has remained strong ."
"History of the Inflation –Unemployment Tradeoff  In 1977, Congress legislated the Federal Reserve ’s “dual mandate,” under which the FOMC  is required to pursue both maximum employment and stable prices , with both objectives on an equal footing.2  At the outset , it is worth stressing that  these goals  are generally compl ementary,  and I  will return to this point shortly."
" 2 Before  1977, the Federal Reserve viewed itself as having a dual mandate because it was covered by the Employment Act of 1946, which gave the whole federal government a list of objectives that included maximum employment and maximum “ purchasing power.”  The predominant interpretation of the latter objective was that it corresponded to price stability."
 - 2 -  Maximum employment is the highest level of employment that will not cause inflation to escalate significantly above levels consistent with price stability.
"  Before going i nto those  tradeoffs, I want to emphasize that achieving the Committee ’s employment goal on an ongoing basis re sts on achieving price stability."
" Price stability enables long -lasting economic expansions, which  strengthe n the  labor market and expand employment  opportunities ."
 This process  particularly benefit s families and communities that all too often have been left behind.3  But it i s appropriate to recognize  also that tradeoffs between the goals of maximum employment and price stability can occur in the short term.
" Indeed, the potential shorter -term tradeoff between un employment and inflation has  long featured prominently among the economic considerations  of policymake rs."
" Government action to boost employment through fiscal or monetary stimulus has historically  tended to increase aggregate spending and inflation, too."
" On the contrary, a ctions to reduce inflation by shifting to contracti onary  fiscal or monetary policy ha ve tended to slow economic activity and raise unemployment, or at least slow the pace of job creation."
"  The idea of a short -run tradeoff is reflected in the original specification of the  “Phillips c urve,” named after New Zealand economist A.W.  Phillips, who plotted historical values of the  United K ingdom’s  unemployment rate and growth in nominal wages between  1861 and 1957, show ing an often inverse relationship between the two."
"  3 LópezSalido, Markowitz, an d Nelson (2024) provide a longer -term perspective on how the Federal Reserve has viewed price stability as necessary for achieving  maximum employment on a sustained basis."
" - 3 -  Although t he Phillips c urve was initially specified in terms of wages , later versions have more typically compare d unemployment with price inflation ."
"Taken at face value, a  tradeoff between keeping employment  high and reducing inflation would seem to present policymakers with a dilemma."
" It suggests that when inflation is well above levels associated with price stability, policymakers must  engineer a significant increase in unemployment to bring inflation down."
 Disinflation can be especially challenging  when expectations of future inflation are high.4  We saw this in the 1970s and 1980s .
" Convincing households and businesses that the FOMC was committed to reducing inflation require d accepting a protracted, though ultimately temporary, period of high unemployment, as then Fed Chair Paul Volcker came to believe."
 Volcker is widely credited with ending the  “Great Inflation”  experienced at the time th rough his willingness  to induce a punishing recession.
" He  lowered inflation and kept it down, in substantial part by convincing the public that the Fed would keep inflation in check whatever the cost, thereby lowering expectations of future inflation.5   While long experience shows that there can be  a tradeoff between policy actions to pursue maximum employment and stable prices, there are times and conditions when this is not the case, or at least when there is little evidence of a tradeoff."
"  For example, for most of the  decade after the Great Recession, FOMC policy was , by some measures at  4 In the context of achieving disinflation, the tradeoff between inflation and unemployment is sometimes referred to as the “sacrifice ratio.”  Estimates of the quantitative magnitude of this ratio vary widely, depending on the period being studied and the nature of the macroeconomic model being used."
 Model -based explorations do suggest that  inflation  expectations matter for the size of the ratio.
"Tetlow (2022 ), “How Large Is the Output Cost of Disinflation?” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2022079 (Washington:  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, November),  https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2022079pap.pdf ."
"- 4 -  least, highly accommodative , yet inflation  ran consistently below the Committee’s 2 percent target."
" So w hen inflation is below target and employment is below maximum sustainable levels, accommodative policy can be used to pursue both sides of the mandate."
" One strand of the research literature proposes that a central bank can indeed achieve good economic outcomes  by focusing on a single mandate, an inflation target, and that policies to promote stable prices can also secure low unemployment."
" In this view , stabilization of inflation ensures that the economy performs at its optimal level, with firms producing just the right amount such that no resources, including workers, are left on the sidelines."
" This theory fits in a world in which the economy is driven by demand —in such a case, shocks coming from the demand side of the economy can be offset by monetary policy, which works via  aggregate demand.6 But in the real world —which is not so simple —demand shocks are not the only forces that can drive economic fluctuations."
" Adverse supply shocks , just like  higher inflation expectations, make managing the tradeoff between inflation and un employment more difficult and costly."
" While a sharp reduction in demand reduce s both economic activity and inflation, a sharp reduction in supply, such as a sudden loss of global oil supply, increase s inflation and reduce s economic activity."
"  6 For discussion of t he notion that inflation -targeting  monetary policy can achieve both stable prices and maximum employment , see Ben S."
"Posen (1999),  Inflation Targeting:  Lessons from the International Experience  (Princeton, N.J.:  Princeton University Press )."
"- 5 -  Trying to combat inflation by raising interest rates would further reduce economic activity  and employment , while reducing interest rates to boost economic activity and employment raise s inflation even higher."
" Therefore, counteracting a persistent supply shock with monetary policy tools may help with one side of the mandate but create even larger deviations from the other side of the mandate."
Inflation and U nemployment in the P andemic  and I ts Aftermath  Let me now turn to the pandemic experience.
" Inflation picked up in 2021, and by mid2022, 12month inflation , based on personal consumption expenditures (PCE), hit 7 percent, well above the FOMC’s 2 percent target."
" It was the most significant surge in inflation since the 1970s, prompting fears that it could raise expectations of future inflation and make getting inflation down again require a steep tradeoff —that is, much higher unemployment ."
" In a tight labor market, expectations of continued high inflation can lead workers trying to maintain their living standards to demand higher raises."
" In a context of strong aggregate demand, firms will likely grant the wage incr eases to retain their workers —then pass through the resulting cost increase as higher  prices."
" To avoid a continuing spiral, demand and supply in labor and product markets must be rebalanced —through lower  aggregate demand, greater aggregate supply, or both.7  If achieving this balance requires a drastic reduction in aggregate demand, then sustainably taming inflation could require a high cost in terms of the employment  7 For a discussion of wage –price spirals, see  Ben S."
" As inflation rose and began to appear persistent,  the FOMC rightly focused on restoring price stability, knowing that without price stability, the economy would not work for anyone and that high inflation would ultimately undermine the strength of the labor market."
" While interest rates rose  rapidly, some feared that the cost of disinflation would be persistently elevated unemployment."
" We have seen inflation cool significantly, falling more rapidly than at any time since the 1980s ."
 Yet unemployment remains near the low est levels seen only a few times since the 1960s .
How have we managed to avoid the familiar tradeoff during this period and see such welcome outcomes on both the inflation and employment fronts ?
 These center on the fact that the pandemic inflation featured both supply and demand shocks.
" In the limited time that I have today, I don’t propose to get into the debate about exactly how much of the recent inflation can be explained by supply as opposed to demand ."
 But I will discuss how  both demand and supply forces  have been important in the rise and fall in the inflation  rate.8  8 Precisely quantifying the relative roles of supply and demand in the pandemic inflation will likely remain a controversial pursuit for some time.
" One  approach is to focus on relative movements of particular prices and of specific output categories  in a “bottom up” manner , as illustrated , for example,  by Adam Hale Shapiro (2022 ), “Decomposing Supply and D emand Driven Inflation ,” working paper , Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, February ."
"Bernanke ( 2023 ), “What Caused the U.S. PandemicEra Inflation?” NBER Working Paper Series 31417 (Cambridge, Mass.:  National Bureau of Economic Research, June),  https://www.nber.org/papers/w31417."
" And it wasn’t just motor vehicles; for example, you might recall reports of food processing plant shutdowns, and many other goods -producing industries also  suffered from “lost output .”  U.S. i ndustrial production dropped at the onset of the pandemic and then remained below its pre -pandemic level until early 2022 despite strong demand for physical goods; indeed, evidence shows that output was held down by insufficient supply of material s.10  9 The auto industry’s experience during the  pandemic is a good example of how many industries’ production functions  are, in economists’ terms, “Leonti ef,” meaning that shortages of even one key component can restrict production even if other components are available."
10 Industrial production was low despite strong demand:   New orders indexes from many sources were  elevated throughout late 2020 and 2021.
" A  slowdown in immigration , likewise , deprived the economy of a customary source of labor supply growth, as did elevated mortality due to C OVID -19.11   Fortunately, these supply shortages for both goods and labor have mostly dissipated."
" More broadly, strong labor demand has enticed more workers into the labor market to the point that l abor force  11 Per data from the B ureau of L abor Statistics  Current Population Survey, the labor force level among foreign -born workers had a pre -pandemic peak about a year before the pandemic and did not fully recover to this peak until early 2022."
" Economic expansions, such as the one that has continued since April 2020, present more opportunities for workers to find a good match.12  And it appears that workers and  firms were pretty efficient at finding each other over the past couple  of years , likely upgrading the average quality of a job match in the process .13  Higher -quality job–worker matches improve the productivity of workers, serving like a boost to labor supply."
"  If reductions in supply contributed to inflation, then recovery of that supply would help lower inflation , too."
" In the pandemic specifically, job -tojob flows appear to have featured strong wage growth; see David Autor, Arindrajit Dube, and Annie McGrew ( 2023),  “The Unexpected Compression:  Competition at W ork in the Low Wage Labor Market ,” NBER Working Paper  Series  31010  (Cambridge, Mass.:  National Bureau of Economic Research, November), https://www.nber.org/papers/w31010 ."
"  - 10 -  inflation  starting in early 2022; for example, in January, the 12month growth of new motor vehicle prices was less than 1 percent, far slower than its peak pace above 13 percent in the spring of 2022."
" On the labor side, supply recovery has likely contributed to disinflation by helping to ease the pace of wage growth—especially in the labor -intensive services industries.14  For private services as a whole, 12 -month nominal wage growth, as measured by average hourly earnings , was 4."
" And , sure enough, price inflation in services has also slowed:  In core PCE services —which accounts for roughly threefourth s of core PCE —12month inflation was 4.1 percent in January, down from its peak of 5.8 percent early last year.15   But supply is  not the only factor behind the slowing of inflation."
 P olicies affecting aggregate demand have  played a role as well .
" On the fiscal side, measures of the impact of government spending on economic growth turned negative in 2021 after being strongly supportive in 2020.16  And in terms of monetary policy, t he FOMC ’s actions in late 2021 indicated a sooner -thanpreviously- anticipated  start to policy rate  14 In general, the most labor -intensive sectors (measured as labor costs’ share of value  added) are mostly  services sectors."
"16 See, for example, the Hutchins Center Fiscal Impact Measure, which estimates t he effect of government tax and spending policy on gross domestic product growth ."
" G rowth of investment in equipment was tepid last year, likely due in part to restrictive financial conditions , even as we have seen growth in manufacturing construction for  semiconductors and electric vehicle batteries  that will help address remaining supplyside bottlenecks ."
"  Aside from these examples of subdued spending in policysensitive sectors, we can also see the imprint of monetary policy in the anchoring of inflation expectations."
" Even amid high inflation, households , businesses, and financial markets believed that inflation would eventually return to its target pace ."
" These beliefs  were guided by the FOMC’s actions :  By rais ing policy rates  expeditiously and communicating clearly , the Committee demonstrated its resolve to lower inflation to 2 percent and its commitment to  the pricestability mandate ."
" Anchored inflation expectations are apparent, for example , in the popular University of Michigan S urveys  of C onsumers ."
 Expectations of inflation for the period coveri ng the next 5 to 10 years have remained relatively stable over the pandemic  and close to levels seen before  the pandemic.
 And s horter -term expectations rose in 2021 but have come back down recently .17  Anchored inflation expectations likely matter for actual price setting .
 That is what modern theories of the Phillips c urve  17 Expected inflation in the New York Fed’s Survey of Consumer Expectations shows a similar pattern to that seen in the Michigan survey.
" And the relevance of that theoretical expectation has been suggested  by surveys reported by Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond staff :  The data show a close relationship between firms’ expectations for overall inflation and those firms’ own price -setting plans.18  Crucially, by keeping inflation expectations anchored, the FOMC has likely forestalled the development  of wage–price spiral dynamics of the kind I mentioned earlier , while also creating conditions in which inflation has been able to peak at a lower rate than  would have been the case if the FOMC had not acted with credibility and clear communication ."
" Real wage growth —that is, growth of wages after accounting for inflation —has turned positive, which means workers’ income is rising faster than  the cost of living."
A Couple  of F inal O bservations about  the P andemic  and I ts Aftermath  These developments help bring us back to the inflation –unemployment tradeoff that started my discussion.
 The steep part of the supply curve can come into play when demand nears the limits of an industry’s capacity.
"Schwartzman and Sonya Ravindranath Waddell (2024), “Inflation Expectations and Price Setting among Fifth District Firms,” Economic Brief 24 -03 (Richmond, Va.:  Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, January), https://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/economic_brief/2024/eb_24 -03."
- 13 -  demand or because of  a temporary reduction in industry capacity—or both.
" Research has shown this is the case for  individual industries, even in the pre -pandemic period .19  During the pandemic , many industries experience d large demand shocks  or supply curtailment that  contributed to inflation, as I have already discussed , and th ose same shocks  also may have exacerbated the inflationary effects by pushing many industries up the steep part of their supply curves.20   Early in the pandemic , the convexity or steepness of industry supply curves was quite costly in terms of our inflation mandate."
" But it has likely helped us more recently as we have apparently moved back down the steep part of the supply curve in many industries , which has allowed for rapid disinflation.21  An open question in the longer term is whether this process has helped firms learn more about supply chains and inventory management such that we might even be less likely to encounter the steep part of supply curves in the future."
"21 For a formal treatment of the notion that monetary policy can be particularly effective at lowering inflation without large output losses following supply and capacity issues, see Xiwen Bai, Jes ús Fern ández -Villaverde, Yiliang Li, and Francesco Zanetti ( 2024),  “The Causal Effects of G lobal Supply Chain Disruptions on M acroeconomic Outcomes:  Evidence and T heory, ” working paper , January, available on the University of Pennsylvania website at  https://www.sas.upenn.edu/~jesusfv/Supply_Chain_Disruption.pdf ."
" Price adjustment frequency has since slowed back down, with the latest data from the third quarter of last year suggesting prices were lasting nearly seven  months.23  Continued slowing of price adjustment frequency is an indicator that firms’ costs  are rising less quickly and the economy is moving back down the Phillips c urve.24  Interestingly, though, in the workhorse academic models used for studying the effects of monetary policy on the economy, the frequency of price adjustment is often  assumed to be constant ."
" Of course, economists have thought about this in the past; but a greater understanding of the relationship between the  price adjustment decisions of individual firms and overall  inflation is an important area for further academic research .25  But large shocks move firms out of their “inaction range” such that a series of large shocks can increase adjustment frequency."
