"  For release on delivery  11:10 a.m. EDT  October  1, 2024         Artificial Intelligence , Big Data, and the Path Ahead for Productivity     Remarks by   Lisa D."
" Today , I will speak to you about AI, big data, and the path ahead for productivity.1  My comments today will build upon what I offered a year ago at the NBER AI meeting  in Toronto, when I  emphasiz ed the importance of business decision - 1 The views expressed here are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee."
  This subject bears careful research and understanding in my role as a monetary policymaker.
 The Federal Reserve ’s dual mandate is to promote maximum employment and stable prices .
"Cook (2023), “ Generative AI, Productivity, the Labor Market, and Choice Behavior ,” speech delivered at the National Bureau of Economic Research Economics of Artificial Intelligence Conference, Fall 2023, Toronto, Sept ember  22, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20230922a.htm ."
"  We still do not know what the magnitude or intensity of these  effect s will be, which workers and firms will be most affected, how big the increase in  productivity might be, or even the period over which these effects will be realized."
"  As firms deploy these technologies and workers discover ways to make use of them , such developments  can create the conditions for greater productivity and thus higher wage growth consistent with stable prices ."
 And adjustments in the labor market that follow as the economy adapts to technical change can affect maximum employment.
"Examining Productivity  Since the high -tech boom ended in the early 2000s , smoothing through recession -driven swings, growth in output per hour worked has been relatively modest , roughly 1."
" In fact, the latest estimate  for productivity would not have looked out of place in the high -tech boom:  it grew 2.7 percent over the year ending in the second quarter."
"  The emergence of generative AI  has raised hopes for a technology -fueled revival of strong growth in labor productivity, which could support rising  real earnings  for workers and purchasing power for households."
"6 See Alexander Bick,  Adam Blandin,  and David Deming  (2024),  “The Rapid Adoption of Generative AI ,” Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, On the Economy  (blog), September 23, https://www.stlouisfed.org/on -theeconomy/2024/sep/rapid -adoption -generative -ai?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=SM&utm_content=stlouisfed&utm_campaign=dc2f59ec -5fde491c -98faf0161b783bd1    - 5 - AI has the potential to affect labor productivity in a wide swath of economic activities across many industries and occupations."
" Although I share the view  that AI could lift productivity  out of this period of low growth , it bears emphasis that recent productivity gains have been modest  despite rather impressive changes in information technology."
" In other words, the modest productivity growth seen of late already incorporates gains from some types of AI."
" Whether generative AI delive rs a similar, incremental contribution to productivity growth or something larger remains to be seen."
" The degree to which AI leads to productivity improvement bears careful watching , because , if it does meaningfully lift productivity , it could help constrain unit labor costs and inflation in the long run ."
" And, of course, measuring productivity in real time is challenging."
" Famously, Chairman Alan Greenspan spied productivity gains  from information technology  in the 1990s long before they appeared in the data."
 The challenge for macroeconomic forecasters is that productivity does not follow immediately from invention and innovation.
" The translation of technology into productivity depends on the choices made by firms, workers, and policymakers ."
" Time -consuming work  at the adopting firm is often needed to tailor the technology to its specific needs.7  For example, a case study by researchers at Harvard Business School  7 See Timothy Bresnahan, Shane Greenstein, David Brownstone, and Kenneth Flamm (1996 ), “Technical Progress and Coinvention in Computing and in the Uses of Computers ,” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity :  Microeconomics  1996 , pp."
"  - 6 - revealed that when GitHub built Copilot, a code -completion tool, on top of generative AI technology adopted from OpenAI, it went through a process of experimentation, false starts, management challenges, and substantial expense.8 Moreover, while productivity growth follows from translation of clever new ideas into concrete business practices, this full effect is realized only when capital and labor are reallocated to the firms that are most adept at doing so."
 This “business dynamism” contribution to productivity dwindled in the years before the pandemic .9  The recent surge in new business creation provides some hope that dynamism may be rebounding.

" Conclusion  In closing, looking ahead, I anticipate a n acceleration  in productivity grounded in the impressive advances in AI, but substantial uncertainty attends that forecast."
" In short, AI will be translated into productivity improvements with “long and variable lags ,” as we monetary policymakers like to say."
" The changes we see in the macroeconomy —aggregate output, employment, and income —are the collective effect of  19 See Tammy  Xu (2022) , “We Could Run Out of Data to Train AI Language Programs,” MIT Technology Review , November 24."
My hope is that rising productivity gains will serve as a counterweight to inflation  going forward.
