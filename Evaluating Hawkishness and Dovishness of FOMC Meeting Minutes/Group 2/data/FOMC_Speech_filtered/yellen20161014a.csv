" The I nfluence of Demand on Aggregate Supply  The first question I would like to pose concerns the distinction between aggregate supply and aggregate demand:  Are there circumstances in which changes in aggregate demand can have an appreciable, persistent effect on aggregate supply?"
" Aggregate demand, in contrast, was seen as explaining short erterm fluctuations around the mostly exogenous supplydetermined  - 2 - longe rrun trend.1  This conclusion deserves to be reconsidered in light of the failure of the level of economic activity to return to its pre -recession trend in most advanced economies."
" This post -crisis experience suggests that changes in aggregate demand may  have an appreciable, persistent effect on aggregate supply --that is, on potential output.2   The idea that persistent shortfalls in aggregate demand could adversely affect the supply side of the economy--an effect commonly referred to as hysteresis--is no t new; for example, the possibility was discussed back in the mid1980s with regard to the performance of European labor markets.3  But interest in the topic has increased in light of the persistent slowdown in economic growth seen in many developed econom ies since the crisis."
" Several recent studies present crosscountry evidence  indicating that severe and persistent recessions have historically had these sorts of long -term effects, even for downturns that appear to have resulted largely or entirely from a  shock to aggregate demand.4  With regard to the U.S. experience, one study estimates that the level of potential output is now 7 percent below what would have been expected based on its pre -crisis trajectory, and it argues that much of this supplyside da mage is attributable to several developments that likely occurred as a result of the deep recession and slow recovery.5  In particular, the study finds that in the wake of the crisis, the United States experienced a modest reduction in labor supply as a re sult of reduced immigration and a fall in labor force participation beyond what can be explained by cyclical conditions and                                                  1 See Solow  (1997)."
" 2 Or, as Summers (2014) asked in a pithy inversion of Say’s law, is it true that “lack of demand creates lack of supply?” (p."
" 3 As Blanchard and Summers (1986) discuss, the question at the time was whether the longrun equilibrium, or “natural,” rate of unemployment in European economies had been permanently raised by previous periods of high actual unemployment."
"  - 3 - demographic factors , as well as a marked slowdown in the estimated trend growth rate of labor productivity."
" The latter likely refle cts an unusually slow pace of business capital accumulation since the crisis and , more conjecturally , the sharp decline in spending on research and development and the very slow pace of new firm formation in recent years.6 If we assume that hysteresis is i n fact present to some degree after deep recessions, the natural next question is to ask whether it might be possible to reverse these adverse supply -side effects by temporarily running a “highpressure economy,”  with robust aggregate demand and a tight la bor market."
" In addition, a tight labor market might draw in potential workers who would otherwise sit on the sidelines and encourage job -tojob transitions that could also lead to more -efficient --and, hence, more -productive --job m atches.7  Finally, albeit more speculatively, strong demand could potentially yield significant productivity gains by, among other things, prompting higher levels of research and development  spending and  increasing the incen tives to start new, innovative b usinesses."
" For example, hysteresis would seem to make it even more important for policymakers to act quickly                                                  6 Fernald (2015), however, argues that much of the apparent slowdown in U.S. potential GDP growth began prior to the 200709 recession."
" In addition, if strong economic conditions can partially reverse supplyside damage after it has occurred, then policymakers may want to aim at being more accommodative during recoveries than would be called for under the traditional view that supply is largely independent of demand."
"  More research is needed, however, to better understand the influence of movements in aggregate demand on aggregate supply.8  From a policy perspective, we of course need to bear in mind that an accommodative monetary stance, if maintained too long, could have costs that exceed the benefits by increasing the risk of financial instability or undermining price stability."
"  Heterogeneity  My second question asks whether individual differe nces within  broad groups of actors in the economy can influence  aggregate economic outcomes --in particular, what  effect does such heterogeneity have on aggregate demand?"
" Unfortunately, most studies of the labor market during this period do not directly speak to this issue, although Holzer, Raphael, and Stoll (2006) investigate changes in employers’ willingness to hire less -skilled workers dur ing these years, while Katz and Krueger  (1999) and my own study with Blinder  (2001) explore the somewhat related question of how the U.S. economy was able to simultaneously experience rapid growth, low unemployment, and low inflation in the late 1990s."
" At the household level, recent research finds that heterogeneity can amplify the effects of adverse shocks, a result that is largely driven by households with very little net worth that sharply increase their savings in a recession.9  At the firm level, there is evidence that financial constraints had a particularly large adverse effect on employment at  small firms  and the start -up of new firms , factors that may be part of the explanation for the Great                                                  9 See Krueger, Mitman, and Perri (2016)."
"   - 6 - Recession’s long duration and the subsequent slow recovery.10  More generally, if larger firms seeking to expand have better access to credit than smaller ones, overall growth in investment and employment could depend in part on the distribution of sales across different types of businesses."
    Economists’ understanding of how changes in fiscal and monetary policy affect the economy might also benefit from the recognition that households and firms are heterogeneous .
" For example, in simple textbook models of the monetary transmission mechanism, central banks operate largely through the effect of real interest rates on consumption and investment."
" For example, spending by many households and firms appears to be quite sensitive to changes in labor income, business sales, or the value of collateral that in turn affects their access to credit --conditions that monetary policy affects only indirectly."
" While the economics profession has long been aware that these issues matter, their effec ts had been incorporated into macro models only to a very limited extent prior to the financial crisis.11  I am glad to now see a greater emphasis on the possible macroeconomic consequences of heterogeneity, including in work by economists at the                                                  10 On the role of financing constraints for firm employment, see Siemer (2014); ChodorowReich (2014); and Duygan -Bump, Levkov, and MontoriolGarriga (2015)."
"    - 7 - Federal Reserve.12  Nevertheless, the various linkages between heterogeneity and aggregate demand are not yet well understood, either empirically or theoretically."
" More broadly, even though the tools of monetary policy are generally not well suited to achieve distributional objectives, it is important for policymakers to understand and monitor the effects of macroeconomic developments on different groups within society."
Financial Linkages to the Real Economy My third question concerns a key issue for monetary policy and macroeconomics that is less directly addressed by this conference:  How does the financial sector interact with the broader economy ?
 F inally --and most importantly --what can monetary policy and financial oversight do to reduce the frequency and severity of future crises?
" For recent work on the effects of monetary policy in models with hete rogeneous agents, see Kaplan, M oll, and Violante ( 2016 ); Gornemann, Kuester, and Nakajima (2016); Auclert ( 2016); and Sterk and Tenreyro (20 16)."
" Research on this topic has, of course, been ongoing for some time, and it has expanded greatly in the wake of the financial crisis.13  But I believe we have a lot more to learn about the ways in which changes in underwriting standards and other determinants of credit availability interact with interest rates to affect such things as consumer spending, housing demand and home prices, bus iness investment (especially for small firms), and the formation of new firms.14  For example, is the persistent increase in the personal saving rate that we have observed since the collapse of the housing bubble primarily a result of a sustained shift towa rd more prudent underwriting standards by                                                  13 For an example of early research on this topic, see Bernanke and Gertler (1989)."
" 14 More empirical work would be useful to disentangle the spending effects that result from changes in credit conditions from those that result from movements in interest rates, as estimates of the latter likely often inadvertently incorporate the former."
" Most empirical mo dels of the overall economy do not explicitly control for the influence of noninterest credit factors on consumption and investment; as a result, estimated interest rate effects will partially reflect the influence of these factors to the extent these fact ors are correlated with interest rates."
" Movements in interest rates influence a firm’s cash flow and the value of its collateral, all else being equal."
" Higher interest rates also adversely affect consumer spending and especially residential investment, both by forcing households to devote a greater portion of their income to debt service and by making it more difficult to qualify for a loan because of maximum payment -toincome rules."
" Evidence for these effects is provided by Gertler and Karadi  (2015), who show that relatively small changes in shortterm interest rates are correlated with large movements in credit costs."
" Such correlations and interactions may explain why some types of spending appe ar to be more correlated with movements in nominal interest rates than with real interest rates; see Fair  (2004, ch."
" Finally, the relative contributions of relaxed lending standards, low interest rates, and other factors to housing bubbles, both in the United States and abroad, remain s an open and unsettled topic ; Agnello and Shucknecht (2011) present cross -country evidence that monetary policy plays an important role, while Dokko and others (2011) argue that monetary policy was a minor influence in the most recent episode."
"  Is it something that will ultimately prove transitory once households  finish repairing their balance sheets or become more confident about their future prospects for employment and income?15  The answer to  this latter question could have significant implications for the longerrun normal , or neutral , level of interest rates and thus for the conduct of monetary policy."
 Inflation Dynamics  My fourth question goes to the heart of monetary policy:  W hat determi nes inflation?
" From my perspective, the standard framework for thinking about inflation dynamics used by central bank economists and others prior to the financial crisis remains conceptually useful today."
" A simple description of this framework might go something like this :16  Inflation is characterized by an underlying trend that has been essentially constant since the mid -1990s; previously, this trend seemed to drift over time, influenced by actual past inflation or other economic conditions."
" Theory and e vidence suggest that this trend is strongly influenced by inflation expectations that, in turn, depend on monetary policy."
" In particular, the remarkable stability of various measures of expected inflation in recent years presumably represents the fruits o f the Federal Reserve’s sustained efforts since the early 1980s to bring down and then stabilize inflation at a low level."
" The anchoring of inflation expectations that has resulted from this policy does not, however, prevent actual inflation from fluctuat ing from year to year in response to the temporary influence of movements in energy prices and other disturbances."
"  - 10 - inflation will tend to run above or below its underlying trend to the extent that resource utilization --which may serve as an i ndicator of firms’ marginal costs --is persistently high or low.17 While this general framework for thinking about the inflation process remains useful, questions about some of its quantitative features have arisen in the wake of the Great Recession and the subsequent slow recovery."
" For example, the influence of labor market conditions on inflation in recent years seems to be weaker than had been commonly thought prior to the financial crisis."
" Although inflation fell during the recession, the decline was qu ite modest given how high unemployment rose; likewise, wages and prices rose comparatively little as the labor market gradually recovered."
" Or does it perhaps reflect the welldocumented reluctance --or,                                                  17 In the economic literature, this general description of the inflation process is referred to as the expectations -augmented Phillips curve."
" In its simplest form, the Phillips curve relates inflation to expected inflation and the intensity of resource utilization in the economy."
" Two well -known variants of the Phillips curve are the traditional “accelerationist” specification and the so -called New Keynesian Phillips curve;  the former approximates inflation expectations using a moving average of past inflation, while the latter assumes that inflation expectations are “rational” and consistent with the predictions of a structural model of the entire economy."
 Some adherents o f either type of Phillips curve argue that their preferred model can explain the behavior of inflation during and after the financial crisis.
 18 See Blanchard (2016) for evidence on how the responsiveness of inflation to resource utilization has changed over time.
"  - 11 - alternatively, limited ability --of firms to cut the nominal wages of their employees, which could help to explain the relatively moderate movements in inflation we saw during and after the recession ?19 Another gap in our knowledge about the nature of the inflation process concerns expectations."
" Although many theoretical models suggest that actual inflation should be most closely related to short -run inflation expectations, as an empirical matter, measures of longrun expectations appear to explain the data better.20  Yet a nother unresolved issue concerns whose  expectations --those of consumers, firms, or investors --are most relevant for wage and price setting, a point on which theory provides no clear -cut guidance."
" More generally, the precise manner in which expectations influence inflation deserves further study.21 Perhaps most importantly, we need to know more about the manner in which inflation expectations are formed and how monetary policy influences them."
" Ultimately, both actual and expected inflation  are tied to the central bank’s inflation target, whether that target is explicit or implicit.22  But how does this anchoring process occur?"
 Does a central bank have to keep actual inflation near the target rate for many years before inflation expectations completely conform?
" More recently, Daly and Hobijn (2014) develop a model in which the reluctance or inability  of firms to cut nominal wages (or both)  creates important nonlinearities in the relationship between labor utilization and wage inflation."
" 20 Specifically, survey measures of long -run inflation expectations are broadly correlated with estimates of inflation’s longer -term trend."
" See Clark and Davig  (2008) ; see also Faust and Wright (2013, who make a related point in the co ntext of inflation forecasting."
" 21 As Mavroeidis, Plagborg -Moller, and Stock (2014) conclude from their exhaustive survey, empirical estimates of the New Keynesian inflation equation are “unab le to pin down the role of expectations in the inflation process sufficiently accurately for the results to be useful for policy analysis” (p."
" 22 For a discussion of the theoretical and empirical influence of monetary policy on inflation in the contex t of a formal inflation -targeting regime, see Bernanke and others (1999b)."
  - 12 - influence inflation expectations directly and quickly by simply announcing their intention to pursue a particular inflation goal in the future?
" Or does the truth lie somewhere in between, with a change in expectations requiring some combination of clear communications about policymakers’ inflation goal, concrete policy actions to demonstrate their commitment to that goal, and at least some success in moving actual inflation toward its desired level in order to demonstrate the feasibility of the strategy?"
" Although historical experience suggests that changing the public’s inflation expectations would be neither quick nor easy, it is not clear which of these possibilities is correct.23  With nominal short -term interest rates at or close to their effective lower b ound in many countries, the broader question of how expectations are formed has taken on heightened importance."
" Under such circumstances, many central banks have sought additional ways to stimulate their economies, including adopting policies that are dir ectly aimed at influencing expectations of future interest rates and inflation."
" The unusually explicit and extended guidance about the likely future path of the federal funds rate that was provided by the FOMC from 2011 through 2014 is an example of such a policy, as is the Bank of Japan’s upward revision to its official inflation objective in 2013."
" Moreover, these and other expectational strategies may be needed again in the future, given the likelihood that the global economy may continue to experience historically low interest rates, thereby making it unlikely that reductions in short -term interest rates alone  would be an adequate response to a future recession.24                                                    23 See Kiley (2008) for a discussion of the relationship between U.S. monetary policy and survey measures of long -run inflation expectations; his results suggest that it took many y ears for the Federal Reserve to succeed in anchoring longrun expectations at a low level."
" In a similar vein, Bernanke and others (1999b) conclude that inflation expectations “respond only after a lag following declines in [actual] inflation” (p."
298) based on their study of the effects of adopting inflation targeting in different countries.
"   - 13 - For all of these reasons, I hope that researchers will strive to improve our understanding of inflation dynamics and its interactions with monetary policy."
" International Linkages  Before closing, let me mention one additional area where more study is needed--the effects of changes in U.S. monetary policy on financial and economic conditions in the rest of the world and the ways in which those foreign effects can feed back to influence conditions here at home."
" Of course, crosscountry monetary policy spillovers have been the subject of scholarly debate since the Great Depression, and much of the formal analysis of this topic dates back to the early 1960s.25  But this issue has received renewed interest with the advent of unconventional monetary policies after the Great Recession and, more recently, the divergence of monetary policies among major advancedeconomy central banks."
"  Broadly speaking, monetary policy actions in one country spill over to other economies through three main channels:  changes in exchange rates; changes in domestic demand, which alter the economy’s imports; and changes in d omestic financial conditions --such as interest rates  and asset prices --that, through portfolio balance and other channels, affect financial conditions abroad."
" Research by Federal Reserve staff suggest s that, all told, U.S. monetary policy spillovers to ot her economies are positive--that is, policies designed to provide stimulus to the U.S. economy also boost activity abroad, as negative effects of dollar depreciation are offset by positive effects of higher U.S. imports and easier foreign financial conditi ons.26  However, this issue is far from                                                  25 See Mundell (1963) and Fleming (1962)."
