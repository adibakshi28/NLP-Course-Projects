 I will begin by offering  a few thoughts on U.S. monetary policy.
" At our most recent meeting  last week , in light of the ongoing unacceptably high inflation, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) increased the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points."
" In my view, our policy stance is now  restrictive, but whether it is sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down remains uncertain ."
" Some signs of slowing in aggregate demand, lower numbers of job openings  and more modest gross domestic product ( GDP ) growth indicate that we have moved into restrictive territory."
"  But inflation remains much too high, and measures of core inflation have remained  persistently elevated , with declining unemployment and ongoing wage growth."
" Should inflation remain high and the labor market remain tight, additional monetary policy tightening will likely  be appropriate to attain a sufficiently restrictive stance of monetary policy to lower  inflation over time."
 I also expect that our policy rate will need  to remain sufficiently restrictive for some time  to bring inflation down and  create conditions that will support  a sustainably strong labor market.
 I will consider  the incoming economic and financial data during the inter meeting  period and its implications for th e economic outlook in determining my view of the appropriate stance of monetary policy.
 I will look for signs of  consistent evidence that inflation is on a downward path when considering future  rate increases and at what point we will have achieved a sufficiently restrictive stance for the policy rate.
"  In my view , the most recent CPI and employment reports have not provided consistent evidence that inflation is on a downward path,  and I will co ntinue to closely monitor the incoming data  as I consider  the appropriate stance of monetary policy going into our June meeting."
" It  is inherent in , and foundational to,  the business of banking:  banks take demand deposits —a short -term liability —and make term loans —creating a longterm asset ."
" The most fundamental banking risks  include credit, concentration , interest rate, liquidity,  cybersecurity, more recently  operational risk  and, of course,  the risk of contagion."
"The Failure of Silicon Valley Bank  As financial services have evolved to meet the demands and expectations of sophisticated and wealthy businesses and individuals , risks inherent in the very nature  of these services —instant access ibility and transferability  of funds —created the potential for instability  at an extensive and accelerated scale ."
" And we have seen consistent growth in bankingas -aservice partnerships —where the bank partners with a nonbank company, often a fintech, to offe r new products and services."
"If regulators are clear in our expectations with banks, and banks fail to meet those expectations, regulators are wellpositioned to take strong action and demand remediation  of supervisory issues ."
" The  low interest rate environment following the 2008 financial crisis shifted the supervisory focus away from interest rate risk to  other risks , just as the  current rising rate environment required supervisor s to return to  interest rate and emerging credit  risk.10 Supervision must also complement regulation."
" See, e.g., Ask the Fed, a Program of the Federal Reserve System, “A Discussion of Unrealized Losses at Community Banks in a Rising Interest Rate Environment” (December 16, 2022); Community Bank Connections, “2022 Year -End Me ssage from Governor Bowman” (“… banks with unrealized securities losses need to carefully consider the potential impact of holding securities with below -market interest rates, including, among other things, the impact on their liquidity, capital, and earni ngs.”); and Ask the Fed, a Program of the Federal Reserve System, “Risk Considerations in a Rising Rate Environment: Applying a Sound Supervisory Approach (April 11, 2023)."
" These include concentration risk, liquidity risk, and interest rate risk."
" The Fed has refined regulatory standards over time a t the direction of Congress, most recently pursuant to the bipartisan Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act,15 and through socalled “tailoring” regulations designed to better align regulation with risk."
" 15  Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act , Public Law No ."
