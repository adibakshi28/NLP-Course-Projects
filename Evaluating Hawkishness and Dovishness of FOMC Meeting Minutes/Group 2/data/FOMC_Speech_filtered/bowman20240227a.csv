"Before discussing bank regulation, I would like to briefly touch on the economy and monetary policy."
" Monetary Policy  Over the past two years, the Federal Open Market Committee has significantly tightened the stance of monetary policy to address high inflation."
"  We have seen progress on inflation  over the past year , with the 12month readings through December of total and core  personal consumption expenditures ( PCE) inflation both below 3 percent for the first time since the spring of 2021."
" However, the  latest consumer price index (CPI) and producer price index (PPI) inflation data through January suggest slower progress in bringing inflation down toward our 2 percent target ."
" Throughout  this time , economic activity has remained strong with ongoing strength in consumer spending."
 - 2 -  upward revisions to employment growth—show a continued tight labor market .
" Last year, t he average pace of job gains slowed and the labor force participation rate rose through November, with the unemployment rate edging up to  3.7 percent."
" In recent  months , however, job growth has rebounded and the  labor force participation rate declined, retracing some of its earlier gains."
"  At its current setting , our monetary policy stance is restrictive and appears to be  appropriately calibrated to reduce inflationary pressures."
" As I’ve noted recently, m y baseline outlook continues to be that inflation will decline further with the policy rate held steady , but I still see a  number of  upside inflation risks that affect my outlook."
" There is also the risk that  a loosening in financial conditions and additional fiscal stimulus  could add momentum to demand, stalling any further progress or even causing inflation to reaccelerate."
" Finally, there is a risk that continued labor market tightness could lead to persistently high core services inflation , as illustrated by the uptick in 12 -month core services CPI inflation in January."
 Recent labor market data suggest ongoing elevated wage growth as some businesses continue to report above -average wage increases to compensate for  elevated prices and high  inflation.
"  Given these risks, and the general uncertainty regarding the economic outlook, I will continue to watch the data closely as I assess the appropriate path of monetary policy."
" The frequency and extent of data revisions over the past few years, as seen in the most recent employment report, make the task of  assessing the current state of the economy as well as  predicting how the economy will evolve even more challenging, and I will remain cautious in my approach to considering future changes in the stance of policy."
" Should the incoming data continue to indicate that inflation is moving sustainably toward our 2 percent goal, it will - 3 -  eventually become appropriate to gradually lower our policy rate to prevent monetary policy from becoming overly restrictive."
 Reducing our policy rate too soon could result in requiring further future policy rate  increases to return inflation to 2 percent in the longer run.
   It is important to note that monetary policy is not on a preset course.
" While the current stance of monetary policy appears to be  at a restrictive level that will bring inflation down to 2 percent over time, I remain willing to raise the federal funds rate at a future meeting should the incoming data indicate that progress on inflation has stalled or reversed."
 Restoring price stabi lity is essential for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run.
" The agencies also have an obligation to consider changes to enhanced risk -based capital rules in the broader conte xt of other  existing and contemplated regulatory requirements, which requires a clear understanding of the cumulative impacts and the implications for  U.S. economic activity, the structure of the financial system , and financial stability , and whether any reforms are consistent with our requirement to tailor regulation."
" Taken together, reducing merger or acquisition activity could have the consequence of prohibiting t ransactions that may  preserve the presence of bank s in rural or underserved areas ; transactions that may further prudent growth strategies or that may result in increased competition with larger peers."
" Stakeholders who are concerned about the current bank merger review procedures and policies should consider direct engagement  with regulators on these issues , including the recently launched mandatory review of regulatory burden under the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act of 1996.10 Climate Change  Banks face many well -known, material risks , including credit risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, cyber risk, and many others."
