"economy, including the implications of international developments, and then talk about my approach  as a policymaker and how I view the current stance of monetary policy."
" Employment rebounded much more swiftly post -pandemic than it did during previous recoveries and has continued to grow at a rapid pace of about 440,000 jobs a month so far this year."
" The unemployment rate, a t 3.7 percent, remains very low."
" Other indicators also point to labor market strength:  Despite a large drop in the number of job openings in August, which may suggest that labor demand is moderating, there is still an unusually high 1.7 job openings per unemployed job seeker."
" Inflation   On the price stability side of the Fed’s mandate, inflation remains stubbornly and unacceptably high, and data over the past few mon ths show that inflationary pressures remain broad  based."
" My focus, therefore, is on bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent target."
 I am heartened to see measures of medium - to longterm inflation expectations falling in the surveys from the New York Fed and the University of Michigan.
" Although those declines may partly reflect falling gasoline prices, they provide some evidence that inflation expectations are well anchored."
" The data on actual inflation, however, have show ed a slower decline  than I  had anticipated , and I am seeking to better understand the reasons."
 I am focused on the lag between signs of easing price pressures and actual inflation coming down from its very high levels.
     Much of the surge in inflation over the past year was roo ted in  the incomplete recovery of aggregate supply from pandemic -related shutdowns .
" This largely reflects worsening global growth prospects, notably in Europe , which is suffering from the reduced flow  of Ru ssian natural gas , and in China , with its  zeroCOVID policy and property -sector difficulties."
"  In particular, inflation in c ore goods price s has been  surprisingly strong , in part because the elevated demand for goods we saw durin g the height of the pandemic has taken longer to abate than previously anticipated ."
"Still, there are reasons to expect core goods inflation to slow in coming months."
  - 4 - Consumer prices continue to rise rapidly over a broad range of services  as demand for services recovers.
 Continued str ong wage increases will likely put further upward pressure on service price  inflation .
 Housing services inflation  will likely boost overall inflation well into next year.
" Although rent increases on new leases are starting to slow, that moderation also is  likely to have  a substantial and uncertain lag before it appears in PCE (personal consumption expenditures) and CPI (consumer price index) measures of inflation ."
"The widespread nature of the inflation pressures suggests that the overall economy is very ti ght, with constrained supply continuing to fall short of demand."
" The Fed cannot act directly on supply, but it can moderate demand by tightening monetary policy."
" This has helped soften interestsensitive components of private demand , including business investment and—most notably —housing."
" While there is heterogeneity across countries, high inflation is a global phenomenon."
" Some observers have raised concerns that central banks around the world, which are tightening policy to contain domestic inflation, may not be accounting for the cross -border spillovers of their policies."
" My role is to focus  on the Fed’s dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people, which is a domestic mandate."
" My colleagues and I on the Federal Open Market  - 5 - Committee ( FOMC ), however, are very attuned to foreign devel opments, including monetary policy abroad, and their effect on domestic conditions through trade and financial  market channels."
" Sharp slowdowns in foreign economies, along with dollar appreciation, are reducing demand for U.S. exports, and financial marke t spillovers between the U nited States and abroad are a two -way street."
 I will also address  how data drive my understanding of the inflation dynamics I have outlined.
 My research on economic growth has given me an appreciation for the dual mandate and the importance of economic and financial stability for fostering innovation and growth.
"   Paying close attention to the data is key, which, of course, includes readings on inflation and the labor market."
" There is also nontraditional, real -time information, such as Google mobility data and Open Table data on dining rese rvations, which were useful in estimating economic activity during various waves of the pandemic."
"  In considering whether standard models remain  appropriate, one focus for me is the wellknown long and variable lag between monetary policy actions and thei r effect on the real economy and on inflation."
" Residential investment also responds quickly to changes in monetary policy, while consumer spending is slower to react ."
 Lags between monetary policy and inflation are even more unclear.
" E xpectations  of future monetary policy can have quite rapid  effects on commodity and other import prices, but monetary transmission through  economic slack appears to  affect inflation more slowly."
" In the current situation, with risks to inflation forecasts skewed to the upside, I believe policy judgments must be based on whether and when we see inflation actually falling in the data, rathe r than just in forecasts."
" Although most forecasts see considerable progress on inflation in coming years, it is important  to  - 7 - consider whether inflation dynamics may have changed in a persistent way, making our forecasts even more uncertain."
   My Perspect ive on Monetary Policy How do these experiences and the principles of data dependence  and risk management influence my views on current monetary policy?
" Notably, we heard about the burden that lower - and middle -income families are feeling f rom high inflation."
 These events highlighted for me the importance of achieving both our employment and price -stability mandates.
" In our current economy, with a very strong labor market and inflation  far above our goal, I believe a risk -management approach requires a strong focus on taming inflation."
 Inflation poses both a near - and long -term threat.
" Aside from the immediate effect of higher prices on households and businesses, the longer it persists and the more people come to expect it, the greater the risks of elevated inflation becoming entrenched."
 I think it is critical that we prevent an inflationary psychology from taking hold.
 My time doing dissert ation research in Russia in the mid -1990s taught me just how disruptive and painful an extremely highinflation environment can be.
"  - 8 - Reports over the past few months have shown high inflation  to be stubbornly  persistent, while the labor market has remained strong."
"  Being data dependent, I have revised up my assessment of the persistence of high inflation."
" And given my riskmanagement approach, with upside risks to inflation being the most salient, I fully supported the stepup in the front -loading of policy over the past three FOMC meetings."
 It puts monetary restraint into place more quickly to reduce demand while supply is constrained.
" It may also act to rein in  inflation expectations and , as a result, to influence wage - and price -setting behavior."
" A lthough lowering inflation  will bring some pain, a failure to restore price stability would make it much harder and much mor e painful to restore it in the future."
" With inflation running well above our 2 percent longer -run goal, restoring price stability likely will require ongoing rate hikes and then keeping  policy restrictive for some time until we are confident that inflation is  firmly on the  path toward our 2 percent goal ."
"At some point, as we continue to tighten monetary policy, it will become appropriate to slow the pac e of increases while we assess the effects of our cumulative tightening on  the economy and inflation."
"  In any case, the path of policy should depend on how quickly we make progress toward our inflation goal."
"   - 9 - In sum, inflation is too high, it must come down, and we will keep  at it until the job is done ."
