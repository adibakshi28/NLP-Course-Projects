"  In a moment, I will explain why I am particularly proud and honored to be speaking to the new graduates of this university, but first I’d like to address students on a  topic that I expect is on the minds of m any of you, which is the job market."
" First, after years of a slow economic recovery, you are entering the strongest job market in nearly a decade."
" The unemployment rate, at 4."
" Job creation is continuing at a steady pace;  the layoff rate is low ; and job openings are up over the past couple years, which is an other  sign of a healthy job market."
" There are also indications  that wage growth is picking up, and weekly earnings for younger workers have made strong gains over the past couple of years."
" That is probably one reason why younger workers reported fe eling significantly more optimistic about the job market compared with  2013, according to a survey published just today by the Federal Reserve.1 Challenges do remain."
" The economy is growing more slowly than in past recoveries , and productivity growth, which is a major influence on wages, has been disappointing ."
" Those  who graduate and enter the workforce during a strong economy are more likely to find employment, remai n employed, and enjoy persistently higher earnings.3 The second reason for optimism is that you  have  already done the one thing that research shows is most important to a successful and stable working life :  earning the degrees you will receive today."
" Beyond these advantages, research also shows that a college or graduate degree typically leads to a happier, healthier, and longer life.4  One explanation for  the greater  advantage in recent decades conferred by higher education is that it reflects a n increase in the demand for educated workers compared                                                  2 For more on median household income adjusted for inflation and the poverty rate, see Posey (2016) and Bishaw and Glassman (2016)."
 The drivers of  this increasing demand for those with college and graduate degrees  are likely to continue to be important .
" At the same time, technological advances have increased demand for workers with the education necessary to perform the ever -growing share of jobs where technology is important."
"  The second major development in the job market is globalization, which allows goods and services to be produc ed wherever it is most economical."
"  - 4 - While globalization will likely continue and technolog y will continue to advance , we don’t know how fast the economy will grow, what new technologies will be developed, or how quickly and consistently employment will expand."
 One reason for the  increasing economic advantage of a college or graduate degree is the very slow growth of earnings in the last few decades for  those with only a  high school education.
" Like many of you, another of your fellow graduates took day and evening classes to balance work and family demands."
