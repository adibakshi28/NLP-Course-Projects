"EDT  May 14, 2024          Growth and Change at Community Development Financial  Institutions     Remarks by   Lisa D."
 A significant portion of the federal funding directed to community development activities during the height of the pandemic flowed through CDFIs.  These investments exemplify how CDFIs can meet increas ed demand while managing rapid growth through expanded capitalization.1  Addressing the funding needs of CDFIs has also helped to elevate awareness of the critical services these institutions provide.
" In the current interest rate environment, where financial institutions have generally tightened credit, CDFIs are especially important for those borrowers who benefit from the flexible underwriting and terms they offer."
"  - 4 - example, research from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas indicates that mission -driven financial institutions, including CDFIs, provided more Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans to borrowers in lowand moderateincome communities and majority -minority communities than their traditional counterparts.3   Growth in D emand for CDFI P roducts and S ervices  Therefore, it is encouraging to see that the industry is growing both in terms of number of certified CDFIs and total assets held."
 The Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond’s 2023 CDFI Survey indicates that nearly threequarters of CDFI respondents experienced an increase in demand for their products from 2022 to 2023.5  CDFIs are especially adept at leveraging capital —with some programs leveraging $8 in privatesector investment for every $1 of public funding.6  That leverage helps meet this growing demand.
" Despite growth in demand, many CDFIs still face challenges in today’s economic environment, especially as it relates to meeting the needs of the communities they serve."
"4 Jacob Scott, Maria Carmelita Recto, and Jonathan Kivell, “ Sizing the CDFI Market: Understanding Industry Growth” (New York: Federal Reserve Bank of New York, August 2023), https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/newsevents/news/regional_outreach/2023/sizingthe-cdfimarket -understandingindustry -growth ."
 They also have been among the most affected  by recent inflation.
"First, demand is outpacing the supply of capital."
" Also, residential mortgage loans account for almost all the volume sold by CDFIs.  As such, there is likely substantial room for growth.7  Later in today’s program, you will hear more about opportunities for CDFIs to explore options, such as pooling and securitizing loans to expand their access to capital markets as well as further developing the secondary market for loans backed by other collateral types aside from residential mortgages."
" - 6 - Third, CDFIs are not immune to the challenges associated with hiring and retaining staff, and managing labor costs, that are faced by many employers in a tight job market."
" - 7 - moment to acknowledge the stellar research efforts of our host, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, related to the growth of the CDFI industry and the origination and sale of loans by CDFIs.  The latter was the impetus for today’s event."
 I hope this res earch will facilitate more conversations and serve as a resource for the industry as CDFIs and those who support them consider how to increase liquidity to meet demand.
