" So, before getting into the substance  of my remarks , I’ll provide some brief thoughts on the econom ic outlook  and monetary policy.1 Monetary Policy Let me begin with the FOMC ’s effort  to lower inflation , which continues to be much too high."
" As a member of the FOMC, I remain focused on bringing inflation down to our 2 percent goal."
"  Over the past year, the Committee  has taken forceful actions to address unacceptably high inflation by significantly raising the federal funds rate and reducing  our balance sheet  holdings of Treasur y and agency mortgage -backed securities ."
    The economic outlook and the outlook for inflation continue to be highly uncertain.
"  While we have seen modestly lower inflation readings in recent months, overall inflation remains   1 These views a re  my own a nd do not necessarily reflect  those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board or  the Federal Open Market Committee."
" Measures  of core services inflation have been persistently elevated , and labor demand exceeds the supply of available workers , which is  leading employers to increase wages in an effort to retain and attract workers."
"  The ongoing tightness in the labor market  puts upward pressure on inflation, even if  some components of inflation moderate due to improvements in supplyside factors ."
" The longer high inflation persists, the more likely it is that households and businesses may come to expect higher inflation in the longer term."
" Should that be the case, the FOMC’s job of lowering inflation would be even more challenging."
"   Given the highly uncertain environment, my views on the future path of monetary policy will continue to be informed by the incoming data and its implications for the outlook."
 I will continue to look for consistent evidence that inflation remains on a downward path when considering further rate increases  and at what point we will have achieved a sufficiently restrictive stance for the policy rate.
" We are still far from achieving price stability , and I expect that it will be necessary  to further  tighten monetary policy to  bring inflation down toward our goal."
 Doing so will likely lead to subdued growth in economic activity and some softening in labor market conditions.
" While  there are costs and risks to tightening monetary policy to lower inflation, I see the costs and r isks of allowing inflation to persist as far greater."
" Federal Reserve Independence Most often , the independence of the Fed eral Reserve  is discussed in terms of independence in the setting of monetary policy."
" While the value of independent  decision making in monetary policy is vital, and research  show s that it leads to better policy outcomes in the long  run, it is also important to emphasize the value of independence in banking supervision and regulation."
" If you look across the regulated banking sectors, you will find that each bank makes different credit decisions, reacting not only to market demand and economic conditions, but also implementing the bank ’s strategy ."
" While I expect t he Board will propose new capital requirements for the largest institutions , including the Basel III  5 Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, a nd Consumer Protection Act, Pub."
"  For example, the bipartisan Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act included several elements designed to tailor regulatory requirements ."
