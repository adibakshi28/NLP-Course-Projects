"For release on delivery  7:15 p.m. E ST February 6, 2020          The Economic Outlook, Monetary Policy, and the Demand for Reserves     Remarks by   Randal K."
" My plan is to address some topical and important issues, some of which are quite technical but  technicalities that I think can  have significant consequences .1  After providing my thoughts on where the economy and monetary policy are now, I will turn to w hat we can expect from monetary policy in the years to come."
"  Changes in the economic environment since the financial crisis, including an apparent decline in the equilibrium interest rate, have complicated the conduct of monetary policy as we work to ach ieve our dual mandate of maximum employment and stable prices."
" The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is currently undertaking a review of its monetary policy strategy, tools, and communication practices to make sure we are best positioned to confront t he challenges ahead."
" Instead, I would like to address a separate but not unrelated topic, the interaction of bank supervision and regulation wi th monetary policy, and how supervision and regulation might work to make monetary policy implementation more effective in the current environment, particularly as it relates to  a bank’s demand for reserves.2     But first, let me start with a brief take o n the current economic outlook."
 The unemployment rate is at a 50year low .
" Taken together, low unemployment and steady participation have boosted the employment -topopulation ratio, which has finally  surpassed  its pre -crisis level."
" A strong labor market, in turn, supports a healthy pace of consumption growth and the economy more generally ."
" Increasing  the capital stock and investing in new technologies are  important for productivity growth, rising living standards, and the economy’s long -run growth rate, so reversing the recent downward trend is essential for the overall health of the economy ."
"  In part , the fall in investment likely reflects business concerns over the pace of global growth and risks to the outlook."
" In partic ular, 2019 was a bad  year for economic growth among  U.S. trading partners, and, as a consequence, our exports suffered."
"   In summary , I remain optimistic about the outlook, but I am also highly aware that some notable risks still threaten growth, both overseas and at home ."
     A few word s on inflation.
" Both headline and c ore inflation , as measured by the price index for personal cons umption expenditures , or PCE , came in at 1.6 percent in December, somewhat  below  the FOMC’s 2 percent objective."
" This deviation does not worry me that much, in part because I expect inflation to move back to target over the medium term, in part as some unusually low reading s in early 2019 pass out of the data ."
        Monetary Policy Considerations  I view the  current stance of monetary policy  as appropriate given the economic outlook and relatively muted inflation pressures.
" Policy is in a good place to support continued economic growth, strong labor market conditions, and inflation returning to target ."
"     - 4 - One important development , as I mentioned at the start,  is that interest rates at home and abroad have declined significantly from their pre -recession levels."
" Policymakers , economists, and marke t part icipants see much of this decline as reflecting  a permanent fall in the equilibrium  rate of interest —that is, the level of the federal funds rate that  keeps the economy at full employment with stable  inflation in the longer  run."
"One such tool is forward guidance:  By credibly conveying to the public that policymakers will likely pursue a path for the policy rate that is lower than previously anticipated, policymakers can put downward pressure on longer -term interest rates."
" In addition, policymakers can implement policies  such as largescale asset  purchases (LSAPs)  that affect the size and composition of the balance sheet :  By purchasing longer -term securities in the open market, the Federal Reserve reduces the quantity of such assets                                                  3 The extent and origins of the global decline in neutral interest rates are much debated."
" Among the likely contributing factors are population aging, a slowdown in the rate of productivity growth, and changing attitude toward risk."
" Some observers argue that forward guidance and asset purchases fully offset the shortfall in policy acco mmodation caused by a lack of space to cut interest rates further, so that the limits on the Fed’s policy rate  did not ultimately constrain our  policy response to the financial crisis ."
" In particular, inflation remained contained, and longer -run inflation expectations did not become unanchored."
" - 6 - To gain the full benefit of our toolkit , it will be important to continue to communicate clearly about our willingness to use all of our  tools in future downturns.6  The greater the public confidence that policymakers will use these tools in res ponse to episodes  when the ability to cut the policy rate is constrained , the more real longer -term interest rates will systematically decline in response to negative economic developments , providing an automatic stabilizer to the economy ."
" Moreover, publi c confidence  in the FOMC’s ability to react  to economic downturns —even when the policy rate is very low —will support the resilience of longer -term inflation expectations at levels consistent with the FOMC’s objective."
 Keeping inflation expectations anchored will in turn further support the FOMC’s ability to lower real interest rates  if the economy were to weaken substantially .
"Balance Sheet Policies and Reserve Demand  Taking stock, I note that one approach to the constraints  on policy  imposed by the current low level of interest rates  is to  make what were previously unconventional tools —balance sheet policies and forward guidance—as conventional as possible."
" In effect, I believe that balance sheet policies are more credible if                                                  6 See the Statement Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation and Balance Sheet Normalization, which is available on the Board’s website at https://www.federalreserve.go v/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20190130c.htm ."
" As the FOMC announced in January of 2019, the Committee intends to implement monetary policy in an ample -reserves regime.7  With that approach, control over the level of the federal funds rate and other short -term interest rates is exercised primarily through the setting of the Federal Reserve’ s administered rates and is not, over the longer term, reli ant on frequent and large open market operations."
 The Committee also reiterated that it would assess the level of reserves most consistent with efficient and effective monetary policy implementation.
                                                   7 See the Statement Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation and Balance Sheet Normalization in note 6.
" - 8 - I will spend the remainder of my time exploring possible means to enhance the efficiency of our monetary policy implementation , including reserve provision, through adjustments to our e xisting regulatory and supervisory regime."
" In particular, I will focus on liquidity regulation and supervision as well as  interactions with monetary policy tools."
"    - 12 - could improve the efficiency of monetary policy implementation, as firms mig ht show a greater willingness to reallocate to Treasur y securities, reducing reserve demand and improving market functioning."
" Finally, some firms and industry observers have pointed to the surcharge for global systemically important banks , and its partial dependence on year -end inputs, as potentially                                                  11 For additional discussion on the possible role of a standing repo facility (SRF) as part of the monetary policy implementation framework, see Board of Governors (2019a)."
  The c urrent repo operations are conducted with only  primary dealers and are designed to ensure a consistently ample supply of reserves to the banking sys tem and support better interest rate control.
" As designed, these repos may have little effect on bank demand for re serves because the repo operations do not provide liquidity against HQLA to a wide range of bank counterparties."
  A facility intended to aff ect reserve demand may therefore require different design features.
 What I am proposing is that we can potentially improve the efficiency of monetary policy implementation by improving the substitutability of reserves and  Treasury securities through adjusting our e xpectations for firms in stress -planning scenarios.
