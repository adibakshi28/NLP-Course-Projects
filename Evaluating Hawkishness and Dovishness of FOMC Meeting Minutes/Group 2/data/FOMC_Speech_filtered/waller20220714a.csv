"For release on delivery  11:00 a.m. EDT ( 9:00 a.m. M DT)  July 14, 2022          Monetary Policy in a World of Conflicting Data     Remarks by   Christopher J."
"Waller   Member     Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at  Rocky Mountain Economic Summit   Global Interdependence Center       Victor, Idaho            July 14, 2022   Thank you, Mike,  and thank you to the Global Interdependence Center  for the invitation to speak to you today.1  Let me start at the place that all remarks about U.S. monetary policy should start, which is with the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability.2   As I discuss below, w e have a very strong labor market, with an unemployment rate that is below the median of policymakers’ expected longer -run level , and high inflation  that is far above  our target.3  We are achieving our mandate when it comes to maximum employment, but we are far from achieving our goal of stable price s."
"Consequently, w hile any monetary policy decision  has implications for achieving maximum employment, and I will address th ose implicati ons in a moment, the FOMC is  now, and must be, utterly focused on moving inflation down toward our 2 percent target."
"  We must be focused on reducing inflation because, despite a lot of talk about recession lately, the evidence from the labor market indica tes the economy is on track, while inflatio n continues to be  far too high ."
" It must be our focus because high inflation is the biggest challenge to sustaining our  employment goal , and the greatest burden for individuals and families, especially lower - and moderate -income households that dedicate a larger share of their spending to necessities."
"  Inflation has to be our focus, every meeting  and every day, because t he spending and pricing decisions people and businesses make every day depend on their expe ctations of future inflation, which in turn depend on whether they believe the Fed is sufficiently committed to its inflation target ."
3 The June Summary of Economic Projections reports a median longer -run level of unemployment of 4.0 percent while the Bureau of Labor Statistics estimate is 3.6%.
"    - 2 - So let me be clear:  I am going to vote to set policy in a manner that will reduce inflation and achieve  our price stabi lity goal , and today I will explain why I don’t see that progress conflicting with our maximumemployment goal."
" Let me start with my view of the labor market and inflation, then turn to the implications for monetary policy, and conclude with where I think  the economy is headed."
 That isn’t a picture of a weakening job market.
 The unemployment rate in June was steady at 3.6 percent.
" It is often said that this is “close to a half -century low” and that is true, but you really have to go back 69 year s, to  - 3 - 1953, to find the unemployment rate more than a couple tenths of a point lower than it was in June."
  This is about as good a job market as any worker has ever seen.
" As a share of the labor force, weekly initial claims for unemployment insurance are near record lows and have been fairly steady all year."
"Turning to GDP, there are signs of  slowing in economic activity ."
" The Commerce Department estim ates that there was a modest contraction in real GDP for the first quarter of the year, and “nowcasting” projections of economic activity, such as the Atlanta Fed’s  4 The measure of job availability is reported by the Conference Board, which calculates the difference between the share of survey respondents who report that jobs are plentiful and the share who report that jobs are hard to get."
"  But I don’t see how that squares with the job creation data , the low unemployment rate , and overall strong labor market that I described  earlier ."
" Past experience has shown  that job creation and the unemployment rate are  timely indicators of  a recession, m ore timely than quarterly GDP."
 Persistently High Inflation  Now let’s talk about inflation.
" On a twelve -month basis, total inflation stood at 9.1 percent, the highest in 40 years."
" No matter how you look at t he data, inflation is far too high and my job is to move it down toward our 2 percent target."
"  We know that suppl y shortages and bottlenecks, including the tight labor market , have contributed to the high inflation readings we are observing."
" We also know  that the  surge in demand during the pandemic that was driven by excess saving , significant fiscal stimulus , and accommodative monetary policy also ha s contributed to the high inflation we are now experiencing ."
 There is some research estimating how much of this inflation  - 6 - came from supply problems and how much from high demand .7  The main point is that both played a large part in driving the inflation that we have seen over the past year.
"But the causes of inflation don’t affect my approach to policy because in writing the FOMC’s  mandate, Congress did not say “Your goal is price stability unless inflation is caused by supply shocks, in which case you are off the hook.”  We want to reduce excessive inflation, whatever the source, in part because whether it comes from supply or demand, high inflation can push up longerrun inflation expectations and thus affect spending and pricing decisions in the near term ."
 These decisions can then push up pric es even more and make inflation harder to get under control.
  I pay attention to both surveys of the public ’s inflation  expectations and measures of inflation expectations derived from trading of inflation -indexed securities.
" The Board staff  combines various surveys and marketbased measures in our Index of Common Inflation Expectations, which has moved up slightly in recent months after being flat for a long time."
 We need to avoid expectations rising so much that they become a factor that drives inflation higher.
"      The Path of Monetary Policy  So, based on persistently high inflation and the very tight labor market that I have described, let’s talk about the implications for monetary policy."
" Since March, the FOMC  7 A recent paper estimates that two -thirds of U.S. inflation is demand driven, while one -third is due to supply disturbances; see Julian di Giovanni, Sebnem Kalemli -Ozcan, Alvaro Silva, and Muhammed Yildirim (2022), “Global Supply Chain Pressu res, International Trade, and Inflation,” paper presented at the ECB Forum on Central Banking 2022, Sintra, Portugal, June 27– 29, https://www.ecb.eu ropa.eu/pub/conferences/ecbforum/shared/pdf/2022/Kalemli -Oezcan_paper.pdf ."
" Also see Adam Hale Shapiro (2022), “How Much Do Supply and Demand Drive Inflation?” FRBSF Economic Letter 202215 (San Francisco:  Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, June),  https://www.frbsf.org/economic -r esearch/publications/economic -letter/2022/june/how -much -dosupply-anddemand -drive -inflation."
 That size increase was not an over -reaction to one data point on inflation— it was primarily the response to a sequence of excessively  high inflation readings since the beginning of the year.
 It was appropriate given the lack of progress on inflation a nd clearly s ignal s the FOMC’s commitment  to get inflation under control as soon as possible.
  The response of financial markets to the F OMC’s policy actions and communications indicate to me that the Committee retains the credibility and the public confidence that is needed to make monetary policy effective.
" Longer -term interest rates have moved up to levels not far from those reflected i n Committee members ’ estimates of the final destination for the federal funds rate in this tightening cycle, effectively implementing policy ahead of time."
"  As I have said before, with inflation so high, there is a virtue in front -loading tightening so that policy moves as soon as is practical to a setting that restricts  demand."
 Getting there sooner will bolster the public’s confidence that we can get inflation down and it will preserve options for adjusting the pace of tightening later i f needed.
" I judge that level is close to neutral, by which I mean a level that neither stimulates nor restricts demand, assuming that the economy is growing mode rately  (at its potential) and unemployment is roughly where it is now."
 If that data come in materially stronger than expected it would make me lean towards a larger hike at the July meeting to the extent it shows demand is not slowing down fast enough to get inflation down.
"Based on what we know about inflation today, I expect that further increases in the target range will be needed to make monetary policy restrictive, but t hat will depend on economic data in the coming weeks and months."
" Between the end of July and the FOMC’s September meeting, we will get two employment and CPI reports with data for July and August."
 I will be looking for signs that inflation has started it s move  down toward our 2 percent target on a sustained basis.
"  I anticipate a decline in inflation will come as actual and anticipated hikes by the FOMC cool demand for products and labor, which will help demand and supply come into a better balance."
" The decline in the rate of inflation will also be assisted by continued improvement in goods  supply bot tlenecks, which is occurring in some sectors, and an increase in labor force participation, which is still significantly lower than it was before the pandemic."
"   After the July meeting, further increases will be restricting demand ."
" Looking further in the future , I will need to see how the tightening this year is affect ing the economy and bringing inflation down toward our 2 percent target."
" Based on my forecast for the economy, I expect monetary policy to be restrictive until there has been a sustained reduction in core personal consumption expenditure (PCE) inflation, w hich excludes food and energy."
" F ood and energy prices  tend to be volatile, so focusing on core PCE inflation is a good guide to inflation pressures in the near and medium term."
"  Importantly, as f utures prices for commodities —food, energy, raw materials —ha ve declined recently , I am expecting total PCE inflation to decline in coming months."
"  In talking about where monetary policy is headed, it is helpful to get a fix on where it is right now."
" I  mentioned the concept of a “neutral” interest rate, and the belief that the federal funds rate will be close to neutral after another 75 -basis point increase  at the end of this month."
" But some would argue that monetary policy is actually further away from neutral, based on the fact that current inflation is so much higher than the federal funds rate."
"  In my view, that rests on a flawed idea of how monetary policy affects spending decisions."
" This means taking into consideration longer -term real rates, which are tied to the expected path of policy and inflation over the next several  years."
" Based on trading in inflation -indexed Treasury securities of different maturities (compared to nominal Treasur y securities) , inves tors see federal funds rates above expected inflation starting about six months from now and steepening thereafter."
 This gives me some confidence that tightening now anticipated by markets and expected by FOMC participants will be sufficient to reduce demand and inflation.
  Evolution of the Economy The FOMC’s plan for getting inflation under control depends on a view of the economic outlook.
" With a policy path like what I described for this year and a bit more tightening next year, the median SEP respondent projected that total PCE inflation is expected to fall from its current elevated level today  to 2.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2024."
" At the same time, the unemployment rate is projected to rise to  8 See Christopher J."
 I say this based on the optimistic view I expressed  earlier about the strength of the labor market and on my analysis of the relationship between job vacancies and the unemployment rate.
" In a recent speech, I noted that w e have an historically high number of job vacancies compared to the number of une mplo yed people.9  Some people have argued that past experience indicates we cannot reduce this large number of vacancies without a big increase in the unemployment rate."
" But I have show ed that past experience actually indicates that a reduction in vacancies can take place without a big loss of employment, and this is the kind of soft landing anticipated by FOMC participants."
" However, for the reasons I have laid out, and co nsidering the evidence on the state of the economy and the outlook, I don’t find it difficult to reaffirm my strong conviction that continued policy tightening will be appropriate to move inflation down toward  our 2 percent target."
