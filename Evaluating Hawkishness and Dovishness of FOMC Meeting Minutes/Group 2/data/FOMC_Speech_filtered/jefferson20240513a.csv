" For release on delivery  9:00 a.m. EDT  May 13, 2024          Communicating about Monetary Policy     Remarks by   Philip N."
"Jefferson   Vice Chair   Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at  “Central Bank Communications:  Theory and Practice, ”  a conference hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland   Cleveland, Ohio         May 13, 2024    Introduction  Thank you , Ed, for the kind introduction and for the opportunity to speak.1   You and the organizers of this conference have put together an excellent program on a very important topic, central bank communication, which is key for effective transmission of monetary policy to the economy."
" To fulfill our dual mandate of promoting max imum employment and price stability, it is vital that we make good  monetary policy decisions and that we communicate those decisions to the public effectively."
" Second, I’ll offer a few historical examples of how economic thinking on monetary policy communication has evolved over time ."
" The Fed publishes a statement after every Federal Open Market Committee  (FOMC) meeting, FOMC minutes three weeks following each meeting, a Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) four times a year, and monetary policy, financial stability, and supervision and regulation reports twice a year."
 The Chair holds a press conference after every FOMC meeting and testifies in front of Congress on the Monetary Policy Report  twice a year.
" Today, i t’s widely accepted that clear communication contributes greatly to the effective transmission of monetary polic y, especially because clear communication can affect the expected path of interest rates and financial conditions more generally."
" Loretta, in one of her speeches, describes very well the role of central bank communication :  “The public will have a better understanding of monetary policy when policymakers are clear about their policy goals, those aspects of the economy monetary policy can and can ’t influence, and the economic information that influences their forecasts and policy decisions ” (Mester, 2018)."
"  She went on to explain that when policymakers are systematic in their policy responses to changing  economic conditions, the public will have a better idea of how the Committee’s monetary policy is likely  to change  in response to anticipated and unanticipated economic developments ."
" In particular, she noted:  “With such knowledge,  - 3 - households and firms can plan better; they can make better saving, borrowing, investment, and employment decisions”  (Mester, 2018)."
" When Loretta joined the  Federal Reserve Bank of  Philadelphia  in 1985, the FOMC did n’t disclose its interest rate decisions ."
" At the ti me, central banking wisdom dictated that monetary policymakers should say as little as possible."
" Some research of that vintage tried to rationalize this “secrecy” through the notion that monetary policy would be particularly effective if it surprised mark ets.2 In the 1990s , central bank communication changed dramatically ."
 Expectations became a focal point in academic and policy circles with the emergence of New Keynesian models in the 1990s as a framework for monetary policy.
" Clear communication also helped stabilize the economy and keep inflation closer to  target because, when the Fed clearly articulated a reaction function, financial markets would be able to anticipate the likely future course o f monetary policy and help the central bank do its work by affecting long -term rates and other asset prices."
" In 2012, the Fed adopted an explicit inflation target of 2 percent and started publishing individual FOMC participants ’ views  on the appropriate future path of the federal funds rate, now  4 See Orphanides and Williams (200 5), among many others."
" Of course, this was an extraordinary time for monetary policy, as interest rates in most advanced economies were close to zero following the Global  Financial Crisis."
" The proposal was adopted , and “fan” charts showing uncertainty  5 The document containing the 2  percent inflation target, named the “Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, ” also clarified that the Committee would not set a quantitative target for maximum employment and stated that the Committee would follow a “balanced approach” in promoting both sides of the dual mandate."
" For example, a data -dependent forward -guidance announcement  can be mistaken for a commitment to a fixed path of interest rates ."
"  - 8 - Conclusion  Let me conclude by repeating what I said at the beginning:  To fulfill our dual mandate of promoting maximum employment and price stability, we need to formulate good policies and to make sure that our policies are clearly understood."
 Doing so helps make monetary policy more effective.
