"For release on delivery 8:55 a.m. CDT March 31, 2014          What the Federal Reserve Is Doing to Promote a Stronger Job Market   Remarks by  Janet L."
 One of the most important things you do is to help people meet the demands of finding a job in what remains a challenging economy.
" I have mentioned some of the things the Fed does to help communities, but the most important thing we do is to use monetary policy to promote a stronger economy."
" The Federal Reserve has taken extraordinary steps since the onset of the financial crisis to spur economic activity and create jobs, and I will explain why I believe those efforts are still needed."
  The Fed provides this help by influencing interest rates.
" By keeping interest rates low, we are trying to make homes more affordable and revive the housing market."
" Since the unemployment rate peaked at 10 percent in October 2009, the economy has added more than 71/2 million jobs and the unemployment rate has fallen more than 3  percentage points to 6.7 percent."
" That progress has been gradual but remarkably steady --February was the 41 st consecutive month of payroll growth, one of the longest stretch es ever."
 Unemployment in the city of Chicago is down from a peak of nearly 13 percent to about 91/2 percent at last count.
" That is about the same improvement as in the larger Chicago metro area, where unemployment has fallen to 81/2 percent."
" Metro Chicago has added 183,000 jobs since 2009, just below the rate for job gains nationwide.1 But while there has been steady progress, there is also no doubt that the economy and the job market are not back to normal health."
" That will not be news to many of you, or to the 348,000  people in and around Chicago who were counted as looking for work in                                                  1 According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, total nonfarm employment for the ChicagoJoliet-Naperville metropolitan division has increased 183,000 since December 2009, or about 5 percent."
" Over this period, employment nationally has increased about 6 percent."
" At 6.7 percent, the national unemployment rate is still higher than it ever got during the 2001 recession."
" It certainly feels like a recession to many younger workers, to older workers who lost longterm jobs,  and to African  Americans, who are facing a job market today that is nearly as tough as it was during the two downturns that preceded the Great Recession."
"  In some ways, the job market is tougher now than in any recession."
" Like many others, she could not find any job, despite clerical skills and experience acquired over 15 years of steady employment."
" When employers started hiring again, two years of unemployment became                                                  2 Bureau of Labor Statistics Local Area Unemployment Statistics for the ChicagoJoliet-Naperville metropolitan division."
 Even those needing her skills and experience preferred less qualified workers without a long spell of unemployment.
" The unemployment rate is down, but not included in that rate are more than seven million people who are working part time but want a fulltime job."

"   - 6 - I have described the experiences of Dorine, Jermaine,  and Vicki because they tell us important things that the unemployment rate alone cannot."
" The first of tho se goals is maximum sustainable employment, the highest level of employment that can be sustained while maintaining a stable inflation rate."
" Most of m y colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee and I estimate that the unemployment rate consistent with maximum sustainable employment is now between 5.2 percent and 5.6 percent, well below the 6.7 percent rate in February."
"  The other goal assigned by the Congress is stable prices, which means keeping inflation under control."
" In the past, there have been times when these two goals conflicted --fighting inflation often requires actions that slow the economy and raise the unemployment rate."
" But that is not a dilemma now, because inflation is well below 2 percent, the Fed’s longerterm goal."
 The Federal Reserve takes its inflation goal very seriously.
" One reason why I believe it is appropriate for the Federal Reserve to continue to provide substantial help to the labor market, without adding to the risks of inflation, is because of the evidence I see  - 7 - that there remains considerable slack in the economy and the labor market."
" With 6.7 percent unemployment, it might seem that there must be a lot of slack in the U."
"  To the extent that people who desire to work lack the skills that employers are demanding, there is less slack in the labor market."
" This is an example of what economists call “structural” unemployment, and it can be difficult to solve."
" For government, effective solutions for structural unemployment, beginning with improved education, tend to be expensive and take a long time to work."
"  But a lack of jobs is the heart of the problem when unemployment is caused by slack, which we also call “cyclical unemployment.”  The governm ent has the tools to address cyclical unemployment."
" Monetary policy is one such tool, and the Federal  - 8 - Reserve has been active ly using it to strengthen the recovery and create jobs, which brings me to why the amount of slack is so important."
"  If unemployment were mostly structural, if workers were unable to perform the jobs available, then the Federal Reserve’s efforts to create jobs would not be very effective."
" Worse than that, without slack in the labor market, the economic stimulus from the Fed could put attaining our inflation goal at risk."
" In fact, judging how much slack there is in the labor market is one of the most important questions that my Federal Reserve colleagues and I consider when making monetary policy decisions, because our inflation goal is no less important than the goal of maximum employment."
"One form of evidence for slack is found in other labor market data, beyond the unemployment rate or payrolls, some of which I have touched on already."
" This number is much larger than we would expect at 6.7 percent unemployment, based on past experience, and the existence of such a large pool of “partly unemployed” workers is a  - 9 - sign that labor conditions are worse than indicated by the unemployment rate."
A second form of evidence for slack is that the decline in unemployment has not helped raise wages for workers as in past recoveries.
 Workers in a slack market have little leverage to demand raises.
" Labor compensation has increased an average of only a little more than 2 percent per year since the recession, which is very low by historical standards.5  Wage growth for most workers was modest for a couple of decades before the recession due to globalization and other factors beyond the level of economic activity, and those forces are undoubtedly still relevant."
" The low rate of wage growth is, to me, another sign that the Fed’s job is not yet don e."
" The concern is that the longterm unemployed may remain on the sidelines, ultimately dropping out of                                                  5 From 2010 to 2013, average annual growth in compensation per hour, hourly compensation as measured in the Employment Cost Index and average hourly earnings for all employees in private industries --all independent estimates of wage and compensation growth --increased annually, on average, no more than 21/4 percent ."
 Participation falls in a slack job market when people who want a job give up trying to find one.
 Lower participation could mean that the 6.7 percent unemployment rate is overstating the progress in the labor market.
 We cut shortterm interest rates as low as they can go and indicated that we would keep them low for as long as necessary to support a stronger economic recovery.
" And we have been purchasing large quantities of longerterm securities in order to put additional downward pressure on longerterm interest rates--the rates that matter to people shopping for a new car, looking to buy or renovate a home, or expand a business."
"This commitment is strong, and I believe the Fed’s policies will continue to help sustain progress in the job market."
"  Through these initiatives, together with the use of monetary policy and steps to safeguard the financial system, the Federal Reserve is committed to strengthening communities and restoring a healthy economy that benefits all Americans."
