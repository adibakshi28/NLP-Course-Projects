" In 1913, Congress established the Federal Reserve at least in part  to help address  the pattern of cyclical financial panics and the ensuing economic turmoil that followed by allowing the Fed to create a more elastic money supply to meet demand for liquidity during times of stress ."
" This  authority  included tools like open market operations, later used as a tool for monetary policy.2  Since its establishment, the Federal Reserve  was granted the authority to engage in discount window lending .3  In addition, d uring the Great Depression, the Fed was  given a broader set of tools to engage in emergency lending unde r section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act.4   More recently, i n 2003, the Federal Reserve restructured its previous discount window lending programs and established the Primary Credit Facility  (PCF)  and Secondary Credit Facility .5  Primary credit  enabled  financially strong banks to obtain secured loans from the discount window  at a penalty rate ."
" The failure of SVB demonstrated how rapidly a run can occur and revealed that the discoun t window must be able to operate in a world in which new technolog ies, rapid communications, and the growth of real -time payments may exacerbate the speed of a bank run."
" Of course, it is possible that a combination of factors may lead a bank to access the discount window —as stress on banking institutions builds, there may be a “pullback” on the ordinary liquidity tools banks use, accompanied by increased demands for liquidity."
 By valuing the collateral at par —when the market value had declined due to the rising interest rate environment —the program allowed eligible borrowers to obtain a greater amount of liquidity than they would have been able to by sim ply pledging collateral to the discount window.
" As originally designed, the interest rate for loans under the program was set at the one -year overnight index swap rate, plus 10 basis points.18  Borrowers were also entitled to prepay loans at any time without penalty.19  As has been well documented, the combination of these terms over time created a significant arbitrage opportunity, which the Fed sensibly cut off as the program was approaching the end of its term for originating new loans.20 We must learn from this experience."
"“As the program ends, the interest rate applicable to new BTFP loans has been adjusted such that the rate on new loans extended from now through program expiration will be no lower than the interest rate on reserve balances in effect on the day the loan i s made."
 This rate adjustment ensures that the BTFP continues to support the goals of the program in the current interest rate environment.
