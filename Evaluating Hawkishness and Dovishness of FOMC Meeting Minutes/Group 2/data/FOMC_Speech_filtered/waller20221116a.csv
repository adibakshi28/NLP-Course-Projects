"For release on delivery  2:35 p.m. EST (12:35 p.m. MST)  November 16, 2022         The Economic Outlook and a Word of  Caution  on Inflation      Remarks by   Christopher J."
"Waller   Member     Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at  59th Annual Economic Forecast Luncheon    Phoenix, Arizona                 November 16, 2022   Thank you,  Dean Kadan , and thank you for the opportunity to speak today about the outlook for the U.S. economy and the implications for the Federal Reserve’s ongoing fight to reduce inflation."
 I will begin with some comments on the overall outlook for economic growth and then tr y to explain how tighter monetary policy this year is intended to dampen demand and put downward pressure on inflation.
" I’ll then  turn to the outlook for inflation, where we saw moderation  in some measures in October , but to a level that remains unacceptably high."
 I’ll finish up with how I expect monetary policy will evolve in the coming months to reduc e inflation and r eturn it to the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) 2 percent goal.
"     Economic growth in the United States has slowed significantly in 2022,  and I expect that slow growth to continue into next year."
" After shrinking  slightly in the first half of this  year, real gross domestic product rebounded in the third quarter to a 2.6 percent annual growth rate."
" But all indications are that this was a temporary boost,  and that weak growth has returned in the last quarter of this year  and will persist into 2023 ."
" There is no secret about why—inflation is very high, something people are reminded of every day when they see the prices of things they buy go up."
" On top of that, higher interest rates are raising borrowing costs for businesses and households."
"    - 2 - At any other time, I would be pretty unhappy  about slowing growth, but not now ."
" If you believe, as I do, that supply bottlenecks in the economy have mostly abated and that elevated inflation is primarily a function of high demand, then slowing down economic growth  is absolutely necessary to bring inflation  down to our 2 percent target ."
 This slowing in activity is a sign that action s taken by the Federal Reserve this year to reduce inflation are working.
" The Federal Reserve tightens monetary policy to reduc e inflation primarily by raising short -term interest rates , which  has the effect of boosting  interest rates throughout the economy."
" Since the FOMC pivoted in late 2021 in response to upwardly revised labor data and higher than anticipated inflation data , rates for  30year fixed -rate home mortgages are up from around 3 percent  to 7 percent today."
"As purchases of homes fall, so does demand for goods that typically accompany purchases —new carpeting, new furniture, new lawn mowers and so on."
 So slowing home sales will decrease demand for goods that complement  the purchase of a new home and that will put downward pressure on the prices of those goods.
 Housing may be  the first but won’t be the last sector of the economy where higher interest rates will have the effect of dampening demand and will ultimately help moderate price increases.
"  Our goal is to rein in demand, bringing demand and supply into better balance, which will help reduce upward  pressure on inflation."
" Wages have been rising more quickly than they have in decades, much faster than productivity growth plus 2 percentage points that I think of as consistent with the FOMC’s 2 percent inflation objective."
"  But I  do see t entative signs of some cooling in the labor market, which is vital to keep rising labor costs from put ting upward pressure on inflation."
"   The employment report published November  4 showed that payrolls grew by 261,000 in October."
" At the same time, w e also saw  the unemployment rate tick up to 3.7 percent , though still close to its  more  than 50year low."
 And that is even with some expectation of slower sales growth in the next couple quarters.
"    That said , we are starting to see some tentative signs of a moderati on in wage growth."
" Wage growth has been a contributing factor to inflation, especially in the service sector, so it is important to get the labor market into better balance to bring  future wage growth down to a more sustainable level that will assist in moving overall inflation lower."
 Let me now turn to the outlook for inflation.
" Headline inflation rose 0.4 percent from September to October, the same pace as the month before, and was up 7.7 percent over the previous 12 months, down from 8.2 percent in September and 9.1 percent as recently as June."
" On a twelve -month change, core inflation came in at about 6.3 percent, down from 6.6 percent  the previous month."
"  Though welcome news, we must be cautious  about reading too much into one inflation report."
" But, as a snapshot, the 0.3 percent increase in core CPI inflation in October  from September , (actually 0.27 percent rounded up) works out to an annualized rate of about 3.25 percent."
 I focus on core over headline inflation beca use I believe it is a better indication of future inflation.
" And, if you weight  the categories by their contributions to the CPI, over 70 percent of the CPI basket continues to see inflation above 3 percent."
 It is way too early to conclude that inflation is headed sustainably down.
" In 2021, monthly core CPI inflation fell during the summer —it fell from 0.9 percent in April 2021 to 0.2 percent in August 2021 before accelerating back to 0.6 percent and 0.5 percent in October  and November of that year."
" More recently, monthly core CPI inflation fell from 0.7 percent in June 2022 to 0.3 percent in July,  only to rebound to 0.6 percent the next two months."
"  - 6 - Inflation remains too high relative to the FOMC’s target, and I thought it would be helpful to offer some detail of what I will be looking at to see continuing improvement in the inflation outlook."
"  One area is  goods inflation, where there was a widespread deceleration  across durables and nondurables  in October."
"  Housing , which  is a large share of expenses for households , is another sector I will be watching closely in the months ahead as an indicator of the direction of overall inflation."
" As I discussed in a recent speech, escalating rents  have played a large role in driving up inflation  this year , and because turnover of leases occur s only periodically , I expect measures of rents and the equivalent for homeowners will continue to increase significantly  for at least several more months .1  But I will be watching for signs of moderation."
"  As I said a moment ago, the inflation outlook for this sector will partly depend on the growth of wages ."
 I will be looking closely for continued slowing in wage growth  back to a more sustainable rate.
" Given that m edium - and longer -term inflation expect ations remain stable , an indication that investors and consumers retain confidence in the Fed’s commitment and ability to achieve its inflation goal, I believe we can expect wage growth to slow ."
" L ike many others, I hope this report is the beginning of a meaningful and persistent decline in inflation."
Now let me turn to the implications of this outlook for monetary policy.
" Since my last outlook speech in October, we have gotten some additional data that reinforces my sense that the labor market may be loosening, and that inflation pressure may be easing."
 A chieving the FOMC’s dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability  is still a one -sided campaign .
" With the labor market still strong and extremely tight, the Committee does not face a tradeoff between employment and inflation ."
" Inflation h as been running significantly above our objective for more than a year, so monetary policy can and must be used aggressively to reduce it."
"  Despite these actions, I believe that policy is barely in restrictive territory today , so more interest rate hikes are needed to get inflation down."
" The first new sentence is about “ wher e we are going ,” which is the level of interest rates at which it will be appropriate to stop hiking."
" If asked what that sentence  means, I would say that, with the current strength and outlook for the labor market, my decision for th e “terminal rate” for policy will focus  on progress toward our inflation goal."
" So, assuming the labor market and financial stability remain in check, the endpoint of the tightening path is highly dependent on the evolution of the inflation data."
 The first is “the cumulative tightening of monetary policy.”  I have noted how si gnificant and aggressive this tightening has been.
"We have gone from a low interest rate economy to one with fairly significant interest rates (although in historical terms , rates are still not that high for a tightening cycle) ."
"  Another factor listed by the Committee was “the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation.”  In my view, the Committee will reach the  2 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2022), “Federal Reserve Issues FOMC Statement,” press release, November 2, https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/monetary20221102a1.pdf ."
" - 9 - terminal rate  well before inflation reaches 2 percent because of the abundance of evidence that it takes months, and perhaps even longer, for the full effects of a rate increase to work through the economy."
" On the contrary, new data , especially on inflation,  are much more important now, well into the tightening  cycle, than when the only direction for the federal funds rate to go was  up— and up by a lot ."
" When the Fed was faced with rapidly escalating inflation and a strong labor market, it l ifted  rates  aggressively off the effective lower bound including several 75 -basis -point steps ."
" But I won’t be making a judgement about that until I see more data, including the next PCE inflation report  and the next jobs report."
" So, although I believe we are seeing some progress in the economy to dampen demand that will help moderate inflation, we have not yet made enough progress."
" As I have said recently, I expect that getting inflation to fall meaningfully and persistently toward  our 2 percent target will require increases in the federal funds rate into next year."
" Until then , I support continued rate increases and ongoing reductions in the Fed’s balance sheet to restrain aggregate demand."
" When we reach  our terminal rate, how long we stay at that level will largely be driven by our progress in bringing down inflation."
