"For release on delivery  9:00 a.m. EDT  September 30, 2022         Global Financial Stability Considerations for  Monetary Policy in a  High -Inflation Environment     Remarks by   Lael Brainard   Vice Chair   Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at  “Financial Stability Considerations for Monetary Policy ,” a research conference organized by  the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and  the Federal Reserve Bank of New York   New York , New York         September 3 0, 2022   I want to start by thanking Anna  Kovner , Rochelle  Edge , and Bill  Bassett for organizing this conference."
" The current global environment  highlights  the importance of having  strong analytic and empirical foundations to understand financial stability  considerations for  monetary policy, and t he research present ed today  will help strengthen those foundations.1  The global  environment of  high inflation  and rising interest  rates highlights  the importan ce of paying attention to  financial stability considerations for  monetary policy."
" As monetary policy tightens globally t o combat high inflation, it  is important to consider how c rossborder spillovers and spillbacks m ight interact with  financial vulnerabilities."
"  Inflation is  very  high in the United States  and abroad, and the  risk of additional  inflationary  shocks  cannot be ruled out ."
" In August, CPI (consumer price index) inflation on a 12month basis was  8.3 percent in the United States,  9.9 percent in the United Kingdom, 9.8 percent in Sweden, 9.1 percent in the euro area , 8.7 percent in Mexico, 7.0 percent in Canada, and 5.7 percent in Korea ."
" Central banks facing high inflation are tightening  monetary poli cy rapidly  to damp demand and bring it into alignment with supply, which is constrained in a variety of  sectors."
" Most recently, inflation in Europe was pushed higher by Russia’s cessation of natural gas  deliveries through the Nord  1 I want to thank Kurt Lewis and Shaghil Ahmed of the Federal Reserve Board for their assistance on these remarks."
  Many central banks around the world have pivoted monetary policy strongly  in order to  maintain anchored expectations and forestall second -round effects from  high inflation becoming embedded in wage and price setting.
"   At a  global  level,  monetary policy tightening i s also proceeding at a rapid pace by historical standards."
" Yields on 10year sovereign debt   2 The central banks of the United States , the United Kingdom, Canada, the euro area, Australia, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland together account for 49 percent of nominal global GDP  measured in dollars at market exchange rates ."
" U.S. monetary policy tightening reduces U.S. demand for foreign products, thus amplifying the effects of monetary tightening by foreign central banks."
 The same is true in reverse:  Tightening in large jurisdictions abroad amplifies U.S. tightening by damping foreign demand for U.S. products.
" These spillovers across jurisdictions are present for decreases in the size of the central bank balance sheet as well as for increases in the policy rate.3  Some estimates suggest that the spillovers of monetary policy surprises between more tightly linked advanced economies such as the U nited S tates and Europe could be about half the s ize of  3 See Lael Brainard (2015), “ Unconventional Monetary Policy and Cross -Border Spillovers,” speech delivered  at “Unconventional  Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies,”  16th International Monetary Fund Jacques Polak Research Conference, Washington, November 6, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/brainard20151106a.htm ; and Lael Brainard (2017), “ Cross -Border Spillovers of Balance Sheet Normalization,” speech delivered  at the National Bureau of Economic Research’s Monetary Economics Summer Institute, Cambridge, Mass."
" - 4 - the own -country effect  when measured in terms of relative changes in local currency bond yields.4   In contrast, spillovers through exchange rate channels  tend to go in oppos ite directions ."
" But in some other jurisdictions, the corresponding currency depreciation  may contribute to inflation ary pressures and require additional tightening to offset ."
" For instance, in c ountrie s where sovereign or corporate debt levels are high, higher  interest rates could increase debt -servicing burdens  and concerns about debt sustainability, which could be exacerbated by currency  depreciation ."
"  For some emerging economies, h igh interest rates in combination with weaker demand in advanced economies could increase capital outflow  pressures, particularly commodity importers facing higher  commodity prices and weaker exchange rates."

"  Fiscal and monetary policy were both supportive in respons e to the pa ndemic , and both were naturally expected to  reverse course  as the recovery gather ed steam."
" A E uropean C entral B ank analysis concluded that  the release of  capital buffer s increased headroom for banks relative to not only their regulatory thresholds , but also their internal risk controls , and enab led banks to continue providi ng credit to households and businesses.6   And of course, m onetary policy is focused on restoring price stability in a highinflation environment ."
" As the program’s first research paper illustrates , in circumstances in which  macroprudential policy cannot  on its own eliminate the amplification of shocks  through financial vulnerabilities , in a low -inflation environment, monetary policy has been relatively more accommodative than would be prescribed by a conventional  monetary po licy rule in order to reduce the likelihood of adverse output and employment outcomes .7  But  in a highinflation  6 These findings were part of a box in the ECB’ s May 2022 Financial Stability Review titled “ Transmission and Effectiveness of Capital -Based Macroprudential Policies .”  See European Central Bank (2022), Financial Stability Review (Frankfurt:  ECB, May), pp."

 We engage in frequent and transparent co mmunications  with monetary policy officials  from other countries  about the evolution of the outlook in each economy and the implications for policy.
" We meet regularly not only with m onetary policy officials from different countries , but also with fiscal and financial stability officials in a variety of international settings , which helps us  to take  into account  cross -border  spillovers and financial vulnerabilities in our respective  forecasts, risk scenarios, and policy deliberations .8   High infla tion imposes significant hardships by eroding purchasing power, especially for those households that spend the greatest share of their incomes on essentials like food, housing, and transportation.9  Following a period where a combination of high demand and a lengthy sequence of adverse supply shocks to goods, labor, and commodities drove inflation to multidecade highs, monetary policymakers  are taking a risk -management posture to guard against risks of longer -term inflation expectations moving above target , which would make it more difficult to bring inflation down ."

"  - 7 - In the modal outlook, monetary policy  tightening t o temper demand , in combination with improvements in  supply, is expected to reduce  demand–supply imbalances  and reduce inflation over time.10  The real yield curve is now in solidly positive territory at all but the very shortest maturities , and w ith the additional tightening and decelerat ion in inflation that is expected over coming quarters, the entire real c urve will soon move  into positive territory."
  It will take time for the full effect of tighter financial conditions  to work through different sectors and to  bring inflation down.
 M onetary policy will  need to be restrictive for some time to have confidenc e that inflation is moving back to target.
 Proceed ing deliberately and in a data -dependent manner will enable us to  learn  how economic activity  and inflation are adjusting to the cumulative tightening  and t o update  our assessments of the level of the policy rate that will need to be maintained  for some time to bring inflation back to 2 percent.
