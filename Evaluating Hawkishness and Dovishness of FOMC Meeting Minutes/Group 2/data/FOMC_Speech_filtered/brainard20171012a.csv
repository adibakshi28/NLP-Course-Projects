"For release on delivery  10:30 a.m. EDT  October 12, 2017         Rethinking Monetary Policy in a New Normal     Remarks by   Lael Brainard   Member   Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at the  Panel on Monetary Policy “Rethinking Macroeconomic Policy,”  a conference sponsored by  the Peterson Institute for International Economics   Washington, D.C.        October 12, 2017    I enjoyed Ben Bernanke’s paper titled “Monetary Policy in a New Era.” 1  He presents a compelling diagnosis of the issues facing policymakers and discusses a variety of policy options."
"monetary poli cymaking over the previous half -century , which I refer to as the “new normal.”3  A key feature of the new normal is that the neutral interest rate --the level of the federal funds rate that is consistent with the economy  growing close to its potential  rate, full employment, and stable inflation --appears to be much lower than it was in the decades prior to the crisis."
" In the Federal Open Market Committee’s ( FOMC ) most recent Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), the median FOMC participant expected a longer -run real federal funds rate, after subtracting inflation,  of 3/4 percent , down sharply from the value  the first time the policy projection w as published in the January 2012 SEP of 2 -1/4 percent --and the average value in the decades prior to the financial crisis of 2 -1/2 percent .4                                                    1 Bernanke (2017)."
" Over the 19602007 period, the real federal funds rate --measured as the nominal federal funds rate less trailing four -quarter core PCE  (personal consumption expenditures)  inflation --averaged 2 -1/2 percent."
"  - 2 - The low level of the neutral rate limits the amount of space available for cutting the federal funds rate  to offs et adverse developments  and thereby can be expected to  increase the frequency and duration of periods when the policy rate  is constrained by the effective lower bound, unemployment is elevated, and inflation is below target."
" In this environment, frequent or extended periods of low inflation run the risk of pulling down private -sector inflation expectations, which could amplify the degree and persistence of shortfalls of inflation, thereby making future lower bound episodes  even  more challenging in terms of  output and employment losses ."
" To the extent it is weighing on longer -run inflation expectations, the persistently low level of the neutral federal funds rate may be a factor contributing to the persistent shortfall of U.S. inflation from the FOMC’s targe t.5  Further complicating the ability of central banks to achieve their inflation objectives in today’s new normal is the very flat Phillips curve observed in the United States and many other advanced economies , which makes the relationship between labor market conditions and price inflation more tenuous."
" For instance, inflation  has remain ed stubbornly below the FOMC’s 2 percent target for the past five years even as unemployment has fallen from 8.2 percent to 4.2 percent, a level that most experts believe is in the vicinity of full employment.6 Bernanke’s paper provides an excellent review of the Federal Reserve’s efforts to operate in this new environment and makes some int eresting new proposals."
  6 The inflation information refers to core PCE inflation measured on a 12 -month average basis.
  - 3 - not likely to be sufficient and proposes a framework that relies on forward guidance with commitment to help central banks achieve their inflation and employment objectives .
 The Makeu p Principle  The academic literature on monetary policy suggests a variety of prescriptions for preventing a lower neutral rate of interest from eroding longer -run inflation expectations.
" For instance, raising the inflation target sufficiently to provide meaningfully greater  policy space could en gend er public discomfort or, at the other extreme, risk unmooring inflation expectations."
"   As I have noted p revious ly, the persistence of the shortfall in inflation from our objective i s an important consider ation for monetary policy.7  The makeup principle, in which policy would make up for past misses of the inflation target, is not reflected in most  standard  monetary policy frameworks,  although it is a n important precept in theory.8  Some of the proposals that have been advanced to implement this principle present some difficulties."
  His proposed temporary pricelevel target would delay the liftoff of the policy rate  from the lower bound until the average inflation over the  entire  lower bound episode has reached  2 percent  and full employment is achieved.
" This type of policy, which would result in temporary overshooting of the inflation target in order to make up for the previous period of undershooting, is designed to , in Bernanke’s words, “calibrate the vigor of the policy response  ."
                                                  10 The 2010 G20 Toronto communiqu é indicated that advanced economies “committed to fiscal plans that will at least halve deficits by 2013 and stabilize or reduce government debt -toGDP ratios by 2016.”   The document is available on the U.S. Depar tment of the Treasury’s website at https://www.treasury.gov/resource -center/international/Documents/The%20G -20%20Toronto%20Summit%20Declaration.pdf .
" For example, the factors underlying what we now understand to be the new normal of persistentl y low interest rates were in many cases initially  viewed as temporary headwinds."
" In these circumstances , a standard policy framework calibrated around the pre -crisis or “old” normal may be biased to underachieving the inflation target in a low neutral rate environment."
" The kind of  policy framework that Bernanke proposes, which pre -commits to implementing  the makeup principle  based on the actual observed performance of inflation during a lower bound episode, could guard against premature  liftoff and help prevent the erosion of longer -term inflation expectations ."
Monetary policymakers operate in an environment of considerable uncertainty and therefore have to weigh the risks of t ightening too little  or too late against those of tightening  too much or too soon.
" While past experience has conditioned  U.S. policymakers to be highly attentive to the  risks associated with a breakout of inflation to the upside , as in the 1970s, they bal ance these risks against those associated with  undershooting the inflation target persistently , as in Japan in the late 1990s and the 2000s ."
"  In weighing these risks, the standard approach is typically designed to achieve “convergence from below,” in whic h inflation gradually rises to its target."
" Given the lags in the effects of monetary policy, convergence from below would necessitate raising interest rates preemptively, well in advance of inflation reaching its target."
" W hile a standard policy framework would tend to prescribe that tightening should start preemptively, well before inflation reaches tar get, Bernanke’s  temporary pricelevel target proposal would imply maintaining the policy rate at the lower bound well past the point at which inflation has risen above target."
" In principle, policymakers would have to be willing  to accept elevated rates of  above -target  inflation for a period following a lengthy period of undershooting."
" Just as policymakers could run a risk of low inflation becoming entrenched in the standard preemptive framework, so, too, there are risks in the temporary price -level target framework."
" One  risk is that the public, seeing elevated rates of inflation, may start to doubt that the central bank is still serious about its inflation target."
" It i s worth noting that the policy is motivated by the opposite concern--that convergence from below, following an extended lower bound episode, may lead to an unanchoring of inflation expectations to the downside."
" Still, a conscious policy of overshooting may be difficult to calibrate, especially since the large confidence intervals around inflation forecasts  suggest that the risks of an undesired overshooting are nontrivial."
 A related risk is that the central bank would lose its nerve:  Maintaining the interest rate at zero in the face of a strong economy and inflation notably above its target would place a central bank in uncomfortable territory.
   - 7 - One additional challenge of the proposed framework is specifying a path for the policy rate immediately following liftoff that smoothly and gradually eases inflation back down to target and facilitates a gradual adjustment of the labor market.
" In the proposed framework, once the cumulative average rate of inflation during the lower -bound period has reached the target of 2 percent, policy would revert to a standard policy rule.11  This implies that a standard polic y rule would kick in at a point when inflation is above target and the economy is at or beyond full employment."
"  - 8 - Today, when many central banks in advanced economies are operating with two distinct tools, policymakers consider the effects of the balance sheet as well as the policy rate in their assessment of the extent of accomm odation provided by monetary policy ."
  - 9 - future overall stance of monetary policy .
" The new normal appears to be characterized by low neutral rates and a weak relationship between overall inflation and unemployment not only in the United States , but also in many othe r advanced economies with lower -bound episodes likely to be more prevalent."
" The current environment appears also to evidence intensified cross -border feedback into financial conditions .15  In this kind of environment , it is conceivable the kind of committed forward guidance associated with the temporary price -level targeting framework proposed by Bernanke, by helping rule out anticipation of a standard  preemptive tightening, could help avoid unwarranted  premature tightening through the exchange rate ."
" For instance, E uropean C entral B ank policy  news that leads to a 10  basis  point decrease in the German 10 -year te rm premium is associated with a roughly 5 basis  point decrease in the U.S. 10year term premium; by contrast, these spillovers were smaller  in the years leading up to the crisis.16 Moreover, news about policy rates and term premiums appear s to have quite different effects on exchange rates, such that  the ordering of policy normalization can have important implications for exchange rates  and associated financial conditions, as I discussed earlier this year .17  Recent staff estimates suggest that news about expected changes in the policy rate tends to have a large spillover through the exchange rate, whereas news about changes in term premiums tend s to lead to corresponding cross -border changes in term premiums , as discussed previously , with much smaller effects  on the exchange rat e."
" Moreover, the exchange rate effect of changes in short -term rates is much greater than it was precrisis."
" For instance, policy news that leads to a 25 basis point increase in the expected interest rate portion of the 10year Treasu ry yield is associated with a roughly 3 percentage point appreciation in the dollar, which is three times greater than the response precrisis."
" By contrast, policy news surrounding a change in U.S. term premiums has a muted effect on the exchange rate bot h now and pre -crisis."
" Financial Imbalances  Finally,  a low neutral rate environment may also be associated with  a heightened risk of asset  price bubbles , which could exacerbate the tradeoff for monetary policy between achieving th e traditional dual -mandate goals  and preventing the kinds of                                                  16 See Kamin , Li, and Rodriguez (forthcoming)."
" But the combination of low interest rates and low unemployment that would prevail during the inflation overshooting period could well spark capital markets  to overextend , leading to financial imbalances ."
" Although important resea rch suggests  that the situations under which monetary policy should take financial imbalances into account a re likely to be very rare , some                                                  18 See, for example, Case, Shiller, and Thompson (2012) and Greenwood and Schleifer (2014) ."
