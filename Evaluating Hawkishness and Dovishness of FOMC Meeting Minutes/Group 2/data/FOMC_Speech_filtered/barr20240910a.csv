" Wh ile it did not provide a mechanism to automatically adjust for  economic growth at that time, the Board stated that it would periodically reevaluate the framework."
" In addition, for the future, I intend to recommend that we account for effects from inflation and economic - 12 -  growth in the measurement of a G -SIB’s  systemic risk profile."
"  As a result,  a GSIB’s  surcharge would not change base d simply on growth in the economy.7    Conclusion  The journey to improve capital requirements since the Global Financial Crisis has been a long one , and Basel III endgame is an important element of this effort ."
" Specifically, the supplemental proposal would update the method 2 coefficients for each of the systemic indicators for the size, interconnectedness, complexity, and cross -jurisdictional activity categories from 2015 until the present using the most recent available two -year average of aggregate global indicator amounts and the corresponding three -year average of euro/U.S. dollar exchange rates."
"  Going forward, i t would also include a mechanism to annually adjust the method 2 coefficients for each of the systemic indicators for the size, interconnectedness, complexity, and cross -jurisdictional activity categories based on U.S. inflation and real economic growth."
T his mechanism would use  a threeyear moving average of annual nominal U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) growth to adjust these coefficients on an annual basis.
