"For release on delivery  1:00 p.m. EDT  (7:00 p.m. local time)  July 16, 2019         Monetary Policy in the Post -Crisis Era     Remarks by  Jerome H."
" Generations later , the World Bank and the IMF continue to play important role s in fostering  global monetary cooperation, financial stability, and international trade , as well as in promot ing sustainable economic growth and reducing poverty."
" I will begin with a discuss ion of  current economic conditions  in the United States , and then highlight  som e significant structural  - 2 - changes in the environment facing monetary policymakers  in the post -crisis era."
" F inally, I will consider how these structural changes are affecting the framework in which we conduct monetary policy, highlighting the Federal  Reserve System ’s ongoing review of our monetary policy strategy, tools, and communication s."
 The U.S. economy is now in its 11th consecutive year of growth.
" Unemployment has steadily declined from its 10  percent  post -crisis peak and has now remained at o r below 4 percent  for more than a year , the longest stretch  in a half century."
" S ome groups, such as African Americans, Hispanics, and rural Americans, continue to face  longstanding challenges, but the  benefits of this strong job market are increasingly widely shared."
  Solid growth has sustained this strong labor market .
  But firstquarter growth  was driven largely by net exports and inventories —two volatile spending categories that are typically not dependable indicators of ongoing momentum.
" In deed, overall growth in the second quarter appears to have moderated."
" Growth in consumer spending, which was soft in the first quarter, looks to have bounced back, but business fixed investment  growth seems to  - 3 - have slowed notably."
" Moreover, the manufact uring sector has been weak  since the beginning of the year , in part weighed down by the softer business spending, weaker growth in the global economy, and, as our business contacts tell us, concerns about trade tensions ."
"  Despite low unemployment and solid overall growth, inflation pressures remain muted."
" After running close to the Federal Open Market Committee’s ( FOMC ) symmetric 2 percent objective over much of last year, both overall consumer price inflation and core inflation moved down earlier this year ."
"  In our baseline outlook, we expect  growth in the United States to remain solid, labor markets to stay strong, and inflation to move back up and run near  2 percent."
" Uncertainties about this  outlook have increased, however, particularly regarding trade developments and global growth."
 FOMC participants have also raised concerns about a more prolonged shortfall in inflation below our 2 percent target.
" Market -based measures of inflation compensation have shifted down, and some surveybased expectations measures are near the bottom of their historic al ranges."
" We are carefully monitoring these developments  and assessing  their implications for the U.S economic outlook and inflation, and will act as  - 4 - appropriate to sustain the expansion, with a strong labor market and inflation near its symmetric 2  percent objective ."
We will also assess these developments in the context of the broader structural changes monetary policymakers have been  facing  since the Great Recession.
"  In the United States, from the mid -1980s to right before  the Great Recession, PCE inflation  averaged 2.6 percent a year,  GDP growth 3 .4 percent, and the interest r ate on a 10year Treasury note 6.5 percent."
" Since the trough of the Great Recession, average inflation and output  growth are around 1 percentage point  lower , and the 10 -year Treasury rate has averaged 2.4 percent ."
" Average inflation rates for the other major advanced economies have declined by almost half, while the inflation rates of major emerging market economies are less than onefifth of what they were."
" Indeed, w ith few exceptions , we are all facing lower rates of interest, growth, and inflation."
" In a number of countries, including the United States, these declines have been accompanied by strong labor markets and a much lower unemployment  rate."
"Such changes in the macroeconomic environment  are significant because the longrun normal  levels of inflation, output, interest rates , and the unemployment rate are important structural features by which we guide policy."
" Standard estimates of the natural rate of unemployment —u*—and the neutral rate of in terest —r*—have been declining for 2 decades, and particularly since the crisis."
"  - 5 - Many factors are contributing to the se changes —wellanchored inflation expectations  in the context of improved monetary policy, demographics, globalization, slower  productivity  growth, greater demand for safe assets, and weaker links between unemployment and inflation."
" T rend inflation, productivity, and interest rates were  declining well  before the crisis."
" But, for monetary policymakers in that era , the threat of high inflation felt proximate , the hard -fought battle to control high inf lation having been just recently won."
 T echnological progress seemed likely to continue to sustain rapid increases in productivity—an outcome we continue to await .
" And the effective lower bound for interest rates was mainly a theoretical concern, except of course in Japan ."
"  For example , the stresses surr ounding the euro crisis and, later, the China -related volatility events in 2015 and 2016 led to a general pullback in demand for risky assets that put downward pressure on U.S. interest rates and weighed on U.S. confidence and growth."
" In addition, we  have seen how monetary policy in one country can influence economic and financial conditions in others through financial market s, trade, and confidence channels."
" In the face of the dramatic economic and financial collapse during the crisis , policymakers quickly exhausted conventional monetary policy tools and employed a range of unconventional measures to support the ir econom ies."
"  Broadly across  different  economies , socalled unconventional monetary policies have generally been successful at lowering interest rates and supporting economic recovery, though cyclical and structural headwinds have made achieving our  inflation targets a challenge."
 We must continue to assess additional strategies and tools to bolster our economies and meet our inflation and employment mandates.
" For example, t he Bank of Canada examin es its framework every five years as part of the renewal of its inflation -control agreement with the federal government."
" Canadian officials have announced the bank will “ assess a broad range of monetary policy frameworks ahead of the renewal in 2021” of t his agreement.2  The                                                  1 See Alan Greenspan (1988), “Trade Deficit and Budget Deficit,” C -SPAN video of a speech delivered at the Economic Club of New York, New York, June 14, https://www.c -span.org/video/?29921/trade -deficit -budgetdeficit&start=58  (quoted remark is 3 minutes, 20 seconds into the video) ."
