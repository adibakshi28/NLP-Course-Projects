"Yellen   Chair   Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at  “Fostering a Dynamic Global Recovery ,” a symposium sponsored by  the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City   Jackson Hole, Wyoming                August 25 , 2017   A decade has passed since the beginnings of a global financial crisis that resulted in the most severe financial panic and largest contraction in economic activity in the United States since the Great Depression."
" Because of the reforms t hat strengthen ed our financial system, and with support from monetary and other policies, credit is available on good terms , and lending has advanced broadly in line with economic activity in recent years , contributing to today’s strong economy .1    At the same time, reforms  have boosted the resilience  of the financial system."
"  Nonetheless, the scope and complexity of financial regulatory reforms demand that policymakers and researchers remain  alert to both areas for improvement and unexpected side effects."
" I will then turn to the evidence regardin g how financial regulatory reform has affected economic growth, credit availability, and market liquidity."

  - 4 - compared with the tidal wave that nearly wiped out the financial secto r that September and led to a plunge  in economic activity in the following months .
 And distress was not limited to  the U.S. economy:  Global trade and economic activity contracted to a degree that had not been seen since the  1930s .
" Moreover, U.S. leadership of global efforts through bodies such as the Basel Committee on Banking Su pervision, the Financial Stability Board (FSB), and the Group of Twenty  has contributed to the development of standards that promote financial stability  around the world, thereby supporting global growth while protecting the U.S. financial system from adve rse developments abroad."

"  - 13 - regulation.18  Economic models of the resilienc e of the financial sector --so called top -down stress -testing models --reinforce the message from supervisory stress tests that the riskiness of large banks has diminished over the past  decade.19  Similarly, model -based analyses indicate that the risk of adverse fire  sale spillovers across banks or broker -dealers have  been sub stantially mitigated.20 Is This Safer System Supporting Growth?"
" I suspect many in this audience would agree with the narrative of my remarks so far:  The events of the crisis demanded action , needed reforms were implemented , and these reforms have made the system safer."
" Now --a decade from the onset of the crisis and nearly seven years since the passage of the Dodd -Frank Act and international agreement on the key banking reforms --a new question is being asked:  Have reforms gone too far, resulting in a finan cial system that is too burdened to support prudent risk -taking and economic growth?"

" Given the uncertainty regarding the effect of capital regulation on lending , rulemakings of the Federal Reserve and other agencies were informed by analyses that balanced the possible stability gains from greater loss -absorbing capacity against the possible adverse effects on lending and  economic growth .24  This ex ante  assessment pointed to sizable net benefits to economic growth from higher capital standards --and subsequent research supports this assessment.25  The steps to improve the capital                                                  23 The related literature is sizable."

"   - 17 - Credit appears broadly available to small businesses with solid credit histories, although indicators point to some difficulties facing firms with weak credit scores and insufficient credi t histories.26  Small business formation is critical to economic dynamism and growth."
" For example, the Federal Reserve and the other banking agencies have recently completed the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act (EGRPRA) review."
" For the final EGRPRA report to the Congress, see Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and National Credi t Union Administration (2017), Joint Report to Congress:  Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act  (Washington:  Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, March), https://www.ffiec.gov/pdf/2017_FFIEC_EGRPRA_Joint -Report_to_Congress.pdf ."
" Substantial progress has been made toward the Federal Reserve’s economic objectives of maximum employment and price stability , in putting in place a regulatory and supervisory structure that is well  designed to lower the risks to financial stability , and in actually achieving a stronger financial system ."
" Enhanced resilience supports the ability of banks and other financial institutions to lend, thereby supporting economic growth through good times and b ad."
 The balance of research suggests that the core reforms we have put in place have substantially boosted resilience without unduly limiting credit availability or economic growth .
