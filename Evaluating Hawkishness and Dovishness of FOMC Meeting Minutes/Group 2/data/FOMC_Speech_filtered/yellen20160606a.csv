" I will discuss  recent economic developments, the outlook, and their implications for monetary policy."
" Most importantly, the economy has registered considerable progress over the past several years toward the Federal Reserve’s goals of maximum employment and price stability, and, as I will explain, there are good reasons to expect that we will advance further toward those goals."
" The news from the labor market over the past year has been generally good, with  significant job gains, the  unemployment rate declining below  5 percent, rising household incomes , and tentative signs of faster wage growth."
" Inflation has been lower than our objective of 2 percent, but I expect it to move up over time for reasons that I will describe."
"  If incoming data are consistent with labor market conditions strengthening  and inflation making progress toward our 2 percent objective, as I expect, further gradual increases in the federal funds rate are likely to be appropriate and most conducive to meeting and maintaining those objectives."
" However, I will emphasize  that monetary policy is not on a preset course and significant shifts in the outlook for the economy  would necessitate corresponding shifts in the appropriate path of policy."
 Will U.S. productivity growth pick up and allow stronger growth of gross domestic product (GDP) and incomes or instead continue to stagnate?
" The uncertainties are sizable, and progress toward our goals and, by implication, the appropriate stance of monetary policy will depend on how these uncertainties evolve ."
" Indeed , the policy path that my colleagues and I judge most likel y to achieve and maintain maximum employment and price stability has evolved and will continue to evolve in response to developments that alter our  economic outlook and  the associated risks to th at outlook."
" In particular, the job market has strengthened substantially, and I believe we are now close to eliminating the slack that has weighed on the labor market since the recession."
" T he unemployment rate had fallen to  5 percent, down from a peak of 10 percent in 2009."
" In addition, t he Bureau of Labor Statistics’ mea sure of the job openings rate was  at a record high  in March , and the quits rate --the share of employees voluntarily leaving their jobs --has moved up and i n March stood close to its pre -recession levels.1  The increase in the quits rate is a sign that workers are feeling more confident about the job market and are likely receiving more job offers."
" P ayroll gains were reported to have been much smaller in April and May  than earlier in the year , averaging only about 80,000 per month.2  And while t he unemployment rate was reported to have fallen further  in May, that decli ne occurred not because more people had jobs but because fewer people reported that they were actively seeking work ."
" A n encouraging aspect of the report , however, was that average hourly earnings for all employees in the nonfarm private sector increased 2 -1/2 percent over the past 12 months --a bit faster than in recent years and a wel come indication that wage growth may finally be picking up.3   Although this recent labor market report was, on balance, concerning, let me emphasize that one should never attach too much significance to any single monthly report ."
" For example, the number of people filing new claims for unemployment insurance --which can be a good early indicator of changes in labor market conditions --remains quite low, and the public’s perceptions  of the health of the  labor market , as reported in various consumer surveys , remain positive."
" That said, the monthly labor market report is an                                                  2 Payroll employment is now reported to have increased 123,000 in April and 38,000 in May."
" According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, payrolls in May were held down about 35,000 by workers on strike at Verizon; thus, the strike can account for a relatively small portion of the slowdown in payroll growth in May."
" In addition, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s “wa ge growth tracker,” wage gains for continuously employed full -time workers have been gradually trending hi gher in recent years and were 3 -1/2 percent over the 12 months through April."
" However, the employment cost index, another broad measure of labor compensation costs, has remained quite soft, rising only 13/4 percent over the year ended in March."
" During the downturn, the Philadelphia area and the city itself saw unemployment rise by less than it did  for the nation as a whole, but unemployment took longe r to recover thereafter.4  In the City of Philadelphia, in particular, unemployment was still running above 10 percent as recently as 2013."
" But unemployment here has fallen appreciably since then, helped by a revival in residential and commercial construc tion that is evident around the city."
" Unemployment rates rose more during the recession for African  Americans and Hispanics than for the nation overall, and even though those rates have also come down by more during the economic expansion, unemployment remains higher for these groups ."
" Unemployment rates for young African  American and Hispanic men without a college degree remain especially high , and one important benefit from further improvement in the labor market would be increased job opportunities for these men and other groups that currently still experience high unemployment."
" To be sure, many of the factors that contribute to the labor market outcomes of minority groups  are not amenable to monetary policy, and measures beyond the scope of monetary policy should be considered to alleviate the economic challenges                                                  4 The discussion refers to data for t he Philadelphia -Camden -Wilmington, PA -NJDE-MD M etropolitan Statistical Area."
" Since 1990, the area’s unemployment rate has averaged about 1/4  percentage point lower than the national rate."
" By contrast, i n the C ity of Philadelphia itself, the unemployment rate has generally run about 2  percentage points higher than for the broader metropolitan area."
"  While the economy has made great st rides toward the FOMC’s objective of maximum employment, somewhat less progress has been made toward our inflation objective."
" Inflation has run persistently below the Fed’s goal of 2 percent over the past several years even as the labor market strengthene d significantly.5  Over the 12 months through April, the price index for personal consumption expenditures rose only about 1 percent."
" But I remain optimistic, because two factors that have been holding down inflation will likely prove only temporary."
" Fir st, the sharp drop in crude oil prices since the middle of 2014 has lowered prices of gasoline and other energy products, significantly restraining overall inflation."
" As the do wnward pressure on prices from these two forces dissipates and as the labor market strengthens further, I expect inflation to move back to 2 percent."
"                                                  5 The notion that inflation can be too low sounds strange to many people, but  very low inflation typically means very low nominal interest rates, leaving little room for monetary policy to push rates down to offset adverse shocks to the economy, thereby increasing the chances that  recessions and the associated job losses would be more severe and persistent."
"  In addition, persistent and unexpectedly low inflation may significantly raise the real cost of making mortgage and other loan payments if accompanied by (as is typically the case) smaller -thananticipated nominal income gains."
" GDP growth was reported to have b een relatively weak early this year, but this measure of growth in economic activity  can vary significantly from quarter to quarter."
" Indeed, while spending data for the second quarter are limited at present, recent data on retail sales and motor vehicle s ales point to a significant step -up in consumer spending and GDP growth this quarter.6    Stepping back from near -term indicators , I woul d like to focus more broadly on the factors likely to affect economic performance over the coming years."
" But speaking for myself, a lthough t he economy recently has been affected by a mix of countervailing forces, I see good reasons to expect that the positive forces supporting employment growth and higher inflation will continue to outweigh the negative ones."
" And as I just noted, I expect to see inflation moving up to 2 percent  over the next couple of years ."
 The increase in employment over the past several years  has contributed to higher household income s and strengthening consumer confidence .
" If the May labor report was an aberration or reflects a temporary slowdown resulting from the  weakness in economic activity at the start of the year, then  job growth should pick up and support further gains in income ."
" Both home sales and construction have been gradually improving, and residential investment made  a noticeable contribution to GDP growth over the past year."
" Housing has been supported by low mortgage rates, and while mortgage credit is still difficult to obtain for households with low credit scores or hardto-document income, those with good credit histories are generally able to borrow at very favorable terms.8  And fiscal policy at the combined national , state,  and local levels, which subtracted  from GDP growth for much of recovery, is now a small positive."
" Economic developments abroad have significantly restrained growth in the United States over the past year, although I am cautiously optimistic that these headwinds are now fading."
" Concerns about slowing growth in China and falling commodity prices, whic h afflicted global financial markets early this year and thus likely weighed on demand, appear to have eased somewhat."
" That said, net exports have been a drag on U.S. GDP growth over the past year and are likely to continue to weigh on growth over the                                                  7 In 2013, according to the Energy Information Agency, households purchased about 730 gallons per household on average."
" New drilling and energy -sector employment have plunged , and the effects have spilled over to businesses serving the energy production sector."
" As I said, the positive economic forces have out weighed the negative, and despite the challenges that the economy continues to face,  I continue to expect further progress toward our employment and inflation objectives ."
 The first involves the thrust and resilience of domestic demand.
" The U.S. economy has performed better than many others around the globe, and that performance has relied chiefly on the resilience of domestic sources of demand, consumer spending in particu lar."
" I continue to think that the answer to that question is yes, but the weak investment performance in recent months is conc erning, and Friday’s employment report provides another reminder that the question is still relevant."
" Much of the turmoil early this year appeared to be associated with concern over the outlook for Chinese growth, which in turn has broad implications for commodity prices and global economic growth."
" However, it is widely acknowledged that China faces considerable challenges as it continues to rebalance its economy toward domestic demand and cons umption."
"  More generally, in the current environment of sluggish growth, low inflation, and already very accommodative monetary policy in many advanced economies, investor perceptions of and appetite for risk can change abruptly."
"  - 10 - A third  key uncertainty for the U.S. economy is the outlook for productivity growth --that is, increases in the amount of output produced per hour worked."
" While the job market has strengthened significantly, GDP increases have been less impressive."
" That combination of solid labor market gains and mode rate GDP growth reflects the fact that labor productivity growth has been unusually  weak in recent years, averaging less than 1/2 percent per year since 2010.9   Over time, productivity growth is the key determinant of improvements in living standards, supporting higher pay for workers without increased costs for employers."
 Recent weak  productivity growth likely helps account for the disappointing pace of wage gains during this economic expansion.
" Therefore, understanding whether, and by how much, productivity growth will pick up is a cruci al part of the economic outlook."
" From 2007:Q4 through 2016:Q1, productivity growth averaged about 1  percent per year."
" By comparison , business -sector productivity growth averaged 1 -1/2 percent per year over the two decades from the mid -1970s to the mid1990s, and then it averaged 2¬3/4 percent per year over the next dozen years until the latest recession began."
" Similarly, Fernald (2014) dates the most recent slowdown in measured productivity growth to before the great recession, in 2005."
"  - 11 - development  spending , and the start -up of new firms, and that these factors have, in turn, lowered productivity growth."
" In the meantime, it would be helpful  to adopt public policies designed to boos t productivity."
" Strengthening education and promoting innovation and investment, public and private, will support longer -term growth in productivity and greater gains in living standards."
 A fourth  important uncertainty for the economic outlook involves how quickly inflation will move back to 2  percent.
" As long as oil prices do not resume their earlier declines and the dollar does not rise substantially  further, my expectation is that inflation will move up to 2 percent over the next one to two years."
" In addition, a further strengthening of labor market conditions would typically be estimated to exert modest upward pressure on inflation over the next couple of years ; but such estimates are inherently imprecise, and the effect on inflation could turn out to be significantly different , either upward or downward, than I expect."
"  Uncertainty concerning the outlook for inflation also reflects , in part, uncertainty about the behavior of those inflation expectations that are relevant to price setting."
" For two decades, inflation has been relatively stable, reacting less persistently than before to temporary factors like a recession or a swing in oil prices."
" The most convincing explanation for this stabil ity, in my view, is that longer -term inflation expectations have remained quite stable.12  So it bears noting that some survey measures of longer -term                                                  11 See Reifschneider, Wascher, and Wilcox (2015)."
"  - 12 - inflation expectations have moved a little lower over the past couple of years, while proxies for these ex pectations inferred from financial  market instruments like inflation -protected securities have moved down more noticeably."
" It is unclear whether these indicators point to a true decline in those inflation expectations that are relevant for price setting ; for example, the financial  market measures may reflect changing attitudes toward inflation risk more than actual inflation expectations."
" If inflation expectations really are  moving lower, that could call into question whether inflation will move back to 2 percent as quickly as I expect."
" My overall assessment is  that the current stance of monetary policy is generally appropriate, in that it is providing support to the economy by encoura ging further labor market improvement that will help return inflation to 2 percent."
" At the same ti me, I continue to think that the federal funds rate will probably need to rise gradually over time  to ensure  price stability and maximum sustainable  employment in the longer run."
" First, the current stance of monetary policy is stimulative, although perhaps not as  stimulative as might appear at first glance."
" At present, many estimates show the neutral rate to be quite low by historical standards --indeed, close to zero when measured in real, or inflation -adjusted , terms.13  The current actual value of the federal funds rate, also measured in real terms, is even lower, somewhere around minus 1 percent."
" With the actual real federal funds rate modestly below the relatively low neutral real rate, the stance of monetary policy at present should be viewed as modestly accommodative .14   Although the economy is now fairly  close to the FOMC’s  goal  of maximum employment,  I view our  modestly accommodative stance of policy as appropriate for several reasons."
" First, with inflation continuing to run below our objective, a mild unders hooting of the unemployment rate considered to be normal in the longer run could help move inflation back up to 2 percent more quickly ."
" Second, a stronger job market could also support  labor market improvement along other dimensions, including greater labor force partic ipation ."
 A third reason relates to the risks associated with the constraint on conventional monetary policy when the federal funds rate is near zero.
" If inflation were to move persistently above 2  percent or the economy were to become notably overheated,  the Committee could readily increase the target range for the federal funds rate."
" However, if inflation w ere to remain persistently low or the expansion w ere to                                                  13 The neutral rate is not directly observable and must instead be inferred from economic data, and estimates will vary depending on the methodology employed."
" I n recent years, the neutral rate has  likely been held down below norm al levels because of the factors I discussed earlier, including  persistently weak growth abroad, the high exchange value of the dollar, low rates of household formation , and weak productivity growth."
" 14 The targeted federal funds rate, currently 0.3 7 percent, less the 12 -month core inflation rate for personal consumption expenditures through April, equals about negative 1.2 percent."
"  - 14 - falter, the FOMC would be able to provide only a limited amount of additional stimulus throug h conventional means.15    These motivations notwithstanding, I continue to believe that it  will be  appropriate to gradually reduce the degree of monetary policy accommodation, provided that labor market conditions strengthen further and inflation continues  to make progress toward our 2 percent objective."
" Because monetary policy affects the economy with a lag, steps to withdraw this monetary accommodation ought to be initiated before the FOMC’s goals are fully reached."
"   But I stress that the economic outlook, including the pace at which the neutral rate may shift over time, is uncertain , so monetary policy cannot proceed on any preset path.16   This point is well illustrated by events so far this year ."
" In addition, data received during the winter suggested that U.S. growth had weakened  even as  progress in the labor market remained solid."
" Because the implications of these developments for the economic outlook were unclear, the FOMC                                                  15 There are unconventional policy tools that could be employed to provide further support to aggregate demand, if necessary, and the efficacy and costs of using those tools would be weighed by the FOMC, as appropriate."
" However, so long as these tools are considered i mperfect substitutes for the federal funds rate as an instrument of policy, the argument that the effective lower bound on nominal interest rates represents a source of asymmetric risk remains valid."
"  In addition, consume r spending appears to have rebounded, providing some reassurance that overall growth has  indeed picked  up as expected."
" Does the latest reading on the unemploy ment rate indicate that we are essentially back to full employment, or does relatively subdued wage growth signal that more slack remains?"
"      Conclusion   To summarize, I have explained why I expect the U.S. economy will continue to improve and why I expect that further gradual increases in the federal funds rate will probably be appropriate to best promote the FOMC’s goals of maximum employment and price s tability."
" What is certain is that monetary policy is not on a preset course, and that the Committee will respond to new data and reassess risks so as to best achieve our goals."
