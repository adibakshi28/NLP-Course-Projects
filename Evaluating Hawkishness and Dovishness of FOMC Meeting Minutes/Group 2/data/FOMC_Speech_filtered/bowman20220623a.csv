"For release on delivery  11:00 a.m. EDT June 23, 20 22         The Outlook for Inflation and Monetary Policy    Remarks by   Michelle  W."
"  I will to uch on some of the banking issues I expect are  on your minds, but one of the biggest issues for everyone right now is inflation, what the Fed is doing to get inflation under control, and the implications for your businesses, your customers, and your communities."
 Inflation is the highest we have seen in the United States  in 40 years and so far  it shows little sign of moderating.
" That tightness  is contributing to inflation, because labor is the largest input cost for producing goods and providing services."
" Inflation is a significant challenge for everyone, but it hits lower - and moderate -income people the hardest, since they spend a larger share of their incomes on necessities and often have less savings to fall back on."
 Inflation is also a burden for businesses that must som ehow balance unpredictable costs while setting  prices that aren’t so high that they discourage customers from purchasing.
 Inflation that continues at these levels is a threat to sustained e mployment growth and to the overall health of the economy.
"  The inflation data  show that , after moderating slightly for a short time, price increases for motor vehicles have picked up again, energy prices rose sharply in May, and prices for food have risen more than 10 percent from a year ago."
" The inflationary effect from the invasion of Ukraine has proven to be lasting for both energy and food  - 2 - commodity prices, with little prospect of the conflict or those price pressures abating very soon."
 One important factor that we often point to in driving today’s spending decisions and inflation outlook are expectations of future inflation.
" Near -term expectation s tend to rise as current inflation increases, but when inflation expectations over the longer -term — the next 5 to 10 years —begin to rise, it may indicate  that consumers and businesses have less confidence in the Fed’s ability to address higher inflation a nd return it to the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) goal of 2 percent ."
" If expectations move significantly above  our 2 percent goal, i t would make it more difficult to change people’s perceptions about the duration of high inflation and potentially more difficult to get inflation under control."
" As we see surveys like the Michigan survey report higher longer -term inflation expectations, we need to pay close attention and continue to use our tools to address inflation before these indicators rise further or expectations of higher inflation become entrenched."
" As I mentioned earlier, one force driving inflation is the extremely tight labor market."
" Even with the se gains, wages have not kept pace with inflation, which has  - 3 - made it much more difficult for many workers to make ends meet in the face of soaring housing, energy,  and food costs."
"  Job creation signals strong labor market demand, particularly in the curre nt environment , with a  large number of  available jobs and fewer job seekers."
" While the strong job market has brought some of these workers back into the workforce, it seem s that many are still waiting or may not return, meaning that labor shortages will likely persist in many sectors of the economy."
" I’ve laid out many of the challenges, so now let me talk about what the Federal Reserve is doing to get inflation under control."
" In the face of inflation  that continues to be much too high and in light of the recent high readings, the FOMC raised the federal funds rate by 75 basis points  at our most recent meeting last week."
" On June 1, the Fed took a separate step to tighten monetary policy by beginning to reduce its large balance sheet of securities holdings."
" I strongly supported the FOMC’s decision last week, and I expect to support additional rate increases until we see significant progress toward bringing inflation down."
" Based on current inflation readings, I expect that an additional rate increase of 75 b asis points will be appropriate at our next meeting as well as increases of at least 50 basis  - 4 - point s in the next few subsequent meetings, as long as the incoming data support them ."
" The case for further rate hikes is made stronger by the current level of the “real” federal funds rate, which is the difference between the nominal rate and near -term inflation expectations."
" Since  inflation is unacceptably high, it doesn’t make sense to have the nominal federal funds rate below near -term inflation expectations."
" While I expect that the labor market will remain strong  as the FOMC continues to tighten monetary policy, these actions do not come without risk."
" But in my view, our number one responsibility is to reduce inflation."
" The Fed’s credibility, earned over decades of l ow inflation, is a powerful policy tool that is critical to our long -term success."
" As a step toward that goal, I also supported the Committee’s action to begin reducing the Fed’s balance sheet, which is pr oviding  unneeded economic stimulus making inflation worse."
" In closing, I know that inflation, and our efforts to lower it, may present challenges for banks."
" The first session on your agenda this morning discussed interest rate risk, and I would be interested to learn how you are managing t his risk so far and what you expect as the year progresses."
