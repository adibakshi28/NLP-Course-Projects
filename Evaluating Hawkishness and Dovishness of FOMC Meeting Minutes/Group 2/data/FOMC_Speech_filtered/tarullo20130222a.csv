" While the recent cris is was no exception, it ha s presented particular challenges to the policy foundations  of central banks, especially those like the Federal Reserve that carry out regulatory manda tes alongside their monetary policy missions."
" The squeeze came from both the liability side of banks’ balance sheets, in the form of more attractive savings vehicles such as money market funds, and from the asset side, with the growth  of public capital mark ets and international competition."
" But in sweeping away the remnants of one key element of the New Deal regulatory system, neither GrammLeach-Bliley nor financial regulators su bstituted new regulatory mechanisms to match the wholesale changes in the stru cture of the financial services industry and the dramatic growth of novel financial instruments."

" And, in the immediate afterm ath of the crisis, there was a need to harness the broadbased demands for refo rm and move forward on some priority reforms without benefit of learning from national initiatives."
