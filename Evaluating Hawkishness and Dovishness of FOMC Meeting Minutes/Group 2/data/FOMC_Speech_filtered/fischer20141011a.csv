" In particular, t he Federal Reserve’s objectives are given by its dual mandate to pursue maximum sustainable employment and price stability , and our policy decisions are targeted to achieve these dual objectives .2  Hence, at first blush, it may seem that there is little need for Fed policymakers to pay attention to developments outside the United States ."
" To  anticipate how these shocks affect  the U.S. economy, the Federal Reserve devote s significant resources to monitoring developments in foreign economies , including emerging market economies (EMEs) , which account for an increasingly important share of global growth."
 2 The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has judged that 2 percent inflation in the price of personal consumption expenditures is most consistent over the longer run with the Federal Reserve’s statutory mandate.
"                                                      - 4 - weighed on global growth, which need s to be taken into account in the setting of U.S. monetary  polic y."
"International Transmission of Monetary  Policies  The recognition that a change in interest rates in one nation can spill  over  to other countrie s dates back at least to the 18thcentury writings of David Hume on the international effect of changes in the money supply .4  The standard model s incorporat ing the international transmission of monetary policy  were developed in Per Jacobsson’s tenure at the IMF --the pioneering research  in the early 1960s by IMF staffer Marcus Fleming and Robert Mundell , which extended standard macroeconomic models to the analysis of an open international economy --work that we know now as the Mundell -Fleming model."
"                                                     - 5 - In the Mundell -Fleming framework , as well as in modern development s of the same theme, a shift toward a more accommodative monetary policy in the United States spills over to foreign economies  by causing their interest rates to fall--though typically by less than in the United States --and their currencies to appreciate against the dollar."
" At the same time , international capital flows tend to shift toward foreign economies in response to the ir relatively more attractive interest rate s."
" A decline in U.S. policy rates has a relatively large effe ct on foreign policy rates in economies that opt to limit exchange rate fluctuations, at least for economies with reasonably open capital accounts."
" Thus, for example, a fall in U.S. policy rates has a  commensurate effe ct on interest rates in Hong Kong."
" By contrast, the central bank in an economy with a freely floating exchang e rate might choose to lower its interest rate by a much smaller amount than in the United States if it believes that domestic conditions so warrant ."
" In this case, the  country’s exchange rate would appreciate as investors rebalance their portfolios in favor of assets denominated in its currency in response to the higher interest rate differential .5   Moving beyond the Mundell -Fleming framework, there is also evidence that monetary policy actions can influence investors’ willingness to hold risky assets , the socalled risk -taking channel .6  Such effects seem  to be most potent when financial 5 See Mundell (1963) and Fleming  (1962)."
 One key implication of the Mundell -Fleming framework is that a central bank can exercise full control over both the exchange rate and the domestic interest rate only when there are significant barriers to the international capital mobility.
" Accordingly, policymakers face the  constraint of the “impossible trinity, ” which states that a country cannot simultaneously have an independent monetary policy, free capital movement , and a fixed exchange ."
 6  Several recent papers discuss risk -taking channels through which monetary policy influences financial conditions more broadly than the level of safe interest rates.
 And countries that offer high prospective returns but have weak policy framework s or other structural vulnerabilities ma y be particularly sensitive to fluctuations in international investment associated with global risk factors.7   International spillovers from monetary policy have been a contentious issue going back at least to the 1920s .
" To facilitate the United Kingdom’ s return to the gold standard at its pre -war parity in 1925, which valued the pound above purchasing power pari ty, the Fed cut interest rates substantially ."
" Britain’s subsequent departure from gold created further challenges for the Federal Reserve; tight U.S. money polic y in the wake of the exit of the s terling bloc from g old in the fall of 1931 helped  keep the United States on gold until 1933 but  exacted high economic costs on the United States and other countries remain ing on gold.8  During the Bretton Woods  period, overly expansi onary  U.S. monetary policy starting in the second half of the 1960s was exported to trading partners through the system of fixed exchange rates."
" However, the Fed’s success in achieving a permanent reduction in inflation through tight monetary policy bolstered the credibility of policies focused on ach ieving low and stable inflation , and many other countries followed."
" Avdj iev and Tak áts’s (2014) study of crossborder bank lending during the t aper tantrum shows a larger pullback for countries with weaker current account balances , and Sahay and others  (2014) find that country -specific market reactions during this period also were affected by  high inflation, weak growth prospects, and relatively low reserves."
" Some EME  critic s argued that U.S.  policy accommodation contributed to a  surge of capital inflows and excessive credit growth  in their economies , creating risks of financial instability ."
" The largest market reactions occurred after  announcements in late 2008 and early 2009 associated with the initial program of quantitative easing , commonly referred to as QE1 , likely at least in part because global financial conditions were extremely stressed at that time , but also perhaps because QE1 demonstrated that it was still possible to ease policy, even when the f ederal f unds rate was constrained by its  effective lower bound.12   Although much of the recent commentary on spillovers has focused on the United States, it bears mentioning that other countries’ monetary polic y announcement s can leave an imprint on international asset prices , with market reactions to new initiatives announced by the European Central Bank ( ECB ) in the past few weeks the most recent example.13  However, event studies tend to find larger international interest rate spillovers for U.S. policy a nnouncement s than for those of other central banks.14   11  See Neely (2011); Fratscher, Lo Duca, and Straub (2013); Rogers, Scotti, and Wright (2014); and Bowman, Londono, and Sapriza (2014)."
" Similarly, earlier work by Ehrmann and Fratzscher (2005) finds larger reactions in euro -area interest rates to U.S. rate changes than vice versa."
"                                                     - 9 - It is also worth emphasizing that asset purchases are merely one form of monetary accommodation, made necessary when policy interest rates hit their zero lower bound."
" Earlier studies of the international effects of conventional U.S. monetary policy --namely , changes in the policy rate --have also found significant spillovers to asset prices in other countries.15  Studies that have compared the spillovers of monetary policy across conventional and unconventional measures generally conclude that the effects on global financial markets are roug hly similar.16  Given the relatively fast recovery of many EMEs from the crisis, post -crisis monetary  accommodation in the U nited States and other advanced economies created policy challenges for many EMEs.17  If they resisted currency appreciation pressures by lowering their policy rates, they risked  over stimulating  domestic demand, exacerbating financial excesses, and overheating their economies."
" In the event, EMEs tried to make the best of a difficult set of tradeoffs by allowing some exchange rate 15  See, for example, Ehrmann  and Fratzscher (2009)  and Hausman and Wongswan (2011) ."
"  16  Among studies of spillovers from conventional versus unc onventional U.S. monetary policy, Rogers, Scotti, and Wright (2014) report no significant differences in relative announcement effects on advanced foreign economy  asset prices  and Treasury yields ; Bowman, Londono, and Sapriza  (2014) find similar EME asset price responses ; Takáts and Vela (2014) report mixed results for EMEs, with a weaker post -2007 relationship in levels  of EME policy rates with U.S. rates but a stronger post -2008 relationship in levels  of five -year yields; and Glick and Leduc (2013) also r eport similar spillovers to exchange rates."
" The effects of the Bank of England’s quantitative easing program on corporate bond yields and sterling exchange rates are similar to predictions from a model estimated over an earlier period by Joyce, Lasaosa, Stevens, and Tong (2011)."
"                                                     - 10 - appreciation, partially reducing their interest rates, and in some countries a lso using capital controls."
"  Along with the boost from U.S. monetary policy during this period, many other factors contributed to the easing of global financial conditions between 2009 and 2012, including macroeconomic policy in a number of other countrie s and other measures that supported stabilization of the global financial system."
" EME sovereign yields declined by more during that period than can be explained by movements in U.S. Treasury yields alone, and there was a worldwide recovery in markets for riskier assets.18   I would also argue strongly that U.S. monetary policies were not beggar  thy neighbor policies  in that , on balance , they generally did not drain demand from other economies ."
 Federal Reserve staff analysis finds that an easing of monetary policy in the United States benefits foreign economies from both stronger U.S. activity and improved global financial conditions.
" And, over a longer sample , Ahmed and Zlate ( forthcoming ) show that capital flows to EMEs are affected by factors other than relative interest rates,  including relative growth prospect s and global risk sentiment."
                                                     - 11 - The t aper t antrum  of 2013 We should also expect spillovers when monetary policy is tightened.
"  21 Powell (2013)  notes that EME s with larger  current account deficits experienced both greater  depreciations of their currencies and larger increases in their bond yields  in mid -2013, suggesting that, while a  reassessment of U.S. monetary policy may have triggered the retrenchment from  EME  asset s, investor concerns about underlying vulnerabilities appear to have amplified the  reaction s."
"  Some  critics of our policies have argued that , by continuing for so long with quantitative easing, the U nited S tates fueled a global boom in asset prices and credit growth that could provid e the seeds of the next financial crisis, with the removal of monetary accommodation serving as an eventual trigger."
"     - 13 - Second , the tightening of U.S. policy will begin only when the U.S. expansion has advanced far enough , in terms both of reducing the output  gap and of moving the inflation rate closer to our 2 percent goal."
" The stronger U.S. economy should directly benefit our foreign trading partners by raising the demand for their exports, and perhaps also indirectly, by boosting confidence gl obally."
" And if foreign growth is weaker than anticipated, the consequences for the U.S. economy  could lead the Fed to remove accommodation more slowly than otherwise."
" Since the 1990s, many EMEs have made remarkable progress on reducing inflation, improving government debt ratios, building foreign reserves , and better regulating and capitalizing  their banking systems."
" In addition, the development of local -currency debt markets has made EMEs less vulnerable to exchange rate fluctuations."
" To be sure, some EMEs continue to face a wide array of structural and policy challenges, including , prominently, rapid credit growth ."
"The Fed’s Responsibility to the Global Economy  So far, I have focused on the immediate spillovers of U.S. monetary policy abroad and the feedback of those effe cts to the U.S. economy."
 There is no question that sharp declines  in U.S. output or large deviations of U.S. inflation from its target level would have adverse effects on  the global economy.
" Conversely, strong and stable U.S. growth in the contex t of inflation close to our policy objective has substantial benefits for the world."
" Thus, as part of our efforts to  achiev e our congressionally  mandated objective of maximum sustainable  employment and price stability, the Federal Reserve will also  seek to minimize adverse   - 15 - spillovers and maximize the beneficial effect of the U.S. economy on the global economy ."
" In the United States, we are working to e nsure that our financial institutions and other market participants are prepared for the normalization of monetary policy and the return to a world of higher interest rates."
" Concluding Remarks   To summarize and conclude , the Fed’s statutory objectives are defined by its dual mandate to pursue maximum sustainable employment and price stability in the U.S. economy."
