" Recently, the Board doubled its resources for this program to better support MDIs.  We brought  to bear  the resources of our c ommunity development function, whi ch promotes economic growth and financial stability in  lower -income communities ."
" Labor Market Disparities  Turning to the workforce more broadly, I want to spend some of my time today talking about disparities  and share some findings from  a conference we hosted yesterday at the Board titled “Disparities in the Labor Market:  What A re We Missing?”  In fulfilling its dual mandate, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has set a target of 2 percent for inflation but does not have a similarly fixed numerical goal for maximum employment."
" That is because the level of maximum employment depends on “nonmonetary factors that affect the structure and dynamics of the labor market,”  which “may change over time and may not be directly measurable.”3  Understanding how close the labor ma rket is to our fullemployment goal requires consulting a variety of evidence along with a healthy dose of judgment."
 This approach to maximum employment has allowed t he FOMC to navigate the current expansion in a way that has likely brought more people ba ck into productive employment than might have been the case with a fixed unemployment  rate target based on precrisis standards .
" The Federal Reserve is also keenly interested in disparities in employment, labor force participation, income, and wealth beca use they may have implications for the growth capacity of the economy."
" When we consider appropriate monetary policy, we need to have a good sense of how fast the economy can grow without fueling excessive                                                  3 The FOMC’s Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy is available on the Board’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/mon etarypolicy/files/fomc_longerrungoals.pdf ."
   - 5 - price inflation.
" At a time when the retirement of  the babyboom generation looks likely to be something of a drag on the growth of the labor force, it is especially important to consider whether relatively low levels of employment and labor force participation for some prime workingage groups represent slack that, if successfully tapped, could increase the labor force and boost economic activity."
" With a richer understanding of economic or social barriers that inhibit labor market success and prosperity for some groups, we may be tter grasp how much these individuals can be helped by broad economic expansion and how much targeted intervention is required through other policy means.4   There is also an important connection between the economy’s potential growth rate and equality of opportunity."
" To the extent that dispar ities in income and wealth across race, ethnicity, gender, or geography reflect such disparities in opportunity, families and small businesses from the disadvantaged groups will then underinvest in education or business endeavors, and potential growth will fall short of the levels it might otherwise attain.5                                                    4 For evidence on the relationship between monetary policy and labor market disparities between some demographic groups, see Carpenter and Rodgers (200 4)."
" The share of wealth held by the top 1 percent rose to 39 percent in 2016, up from 30 percent in 1989.6  Some research suggest s that widening income  and wealth inequality may damp consumer spending in the aggregate, as the wealthiest househ olds are likely to save a much larger proportion of any additional income they earn relative to households in lower income groups that are likely to spend a higher proportion on goods and services.7   Disparities by Race and Ethnicity   When we disaggregate  the economy -wide labor market statistics, we find significant and persistent racial and ethnic disparities.8  In August, the national unemployment rate of 4.4 percent, which is low by historical standards, masked substantial differences across different d emographic groups."
" As shown in figure 1, unemployment rates ranged from 3.9 percent for whites to 4 percent for Asians,                                                  6 Staff calculations from forthcoming SCF data (to be released on September 27); for additional analysis of these data, see Bricker and others (forthcoming)."
" Labor force participation rates, shown in figure 2, also differ subs tantially, although by less than unemployment rates, with the rate for African Americans lowest at 62.2 percent."
" Even more striking, a significant portion of the gaps in unemployment rates across racial and ethnic groups cannot be attributed to differences in their underlying characteristics, such as age and education levels.9    Although the differences in employment rates between racial and ethnic groups are still quite large, they have narrowed recently, after having widened considerably during the recession, and  are near their lowest levels in decades."
" Differences in unemployment rates across racial and ethnic groups tend to widen sharply during recessions, as less advantaged groups shoulder an outsized share of total layoffs, and these differences shrink during recoveries."
" For example, in the second quarter of 2017, the unemployment rate f or black adult men was a little more than 3  percentage points higher than for white adult men."
"  - 8 - racial differen ces in unemployment rates will continue to shrink if the overall unemployment rate falls further.10   More broadly, the persistent disparities in employment outcomes are mirrored in significant and persistent racial and ethnic differences in families’ incom e and wealth."
"  As the economic expansion continues and brings more Americans off the sidelines and into productive employment, it seems likely that the positive trends in employment and participation rates for historically disadvantaged groups will continue."
                                                  10 Data on recent estimates of unemployment r ates for adult men (20 years and older) by race and ethnicity are available from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
" After controlling for sectoral and educational differences, the research suggests that these factors include discrimination as well as differences in access to quality education and informal social networks that may be an important source of information a nd support regarding employment opportunities.13   Federal Reserve Work  on Labor Market Disparities  While the policy tools available to the Federal Reserve are not well suited to addressing the barriers that contribute to persistent disparities in labor market outcomes, understanding these barriers and efforts to address them is vital in assessing maximum employment as well as potential growth."
" The Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking provides a portrait of household finances, employment, housing, and debt; the Survey of Young Workers provides in sights into younger adults’ employment experiences soon after entering the labor force; and the Enterprising and Informal Work Activities Survey provides information about income                                                  13 For example, see Fryer (2011) and Ritter and Taylor (2011)."
  - 10 - generating activities that are often outside the scope of other employment and income surveys.14    Each recent edition of the semiannual Monetary Policy Report  (MPR) has focused on some aspect of the comparative economic experience of different racial and ethnic groups.
"In addition, as indicated in the minutes published after each meeting of the Federal Open Market  Committee (FOMC), Federal Reserve staff regularly report on the differential labor  experiences of different racial and ethnic groups as background for the FOMC ’s deliberations  on monetary policy."
"   Across the Federal Reserve System, a variety of initiatives are aimed at understanding economic disparities and how to foster more -inclusive growth."
 The Opportunity and Inclusive Growth Institute at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis brings together researchers from a var iety of fields to analyze barriers to economic opportunity and advancement.
 The Economic Growth and Mobility Project at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia aims to bring together researchers with community stakeholders to focus on differences in pove rty and economic mobility across demographic characteristics.

" - 11 -  In short, a deeper understanding of labor market disparities is central to the mission of the Federal Reserve because it may help us better assess full employment, where resources may be underutilized, and the likely evolution of the labor market and overall economic activity."
