"Bowman   Member   Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   via prerecorded video   to the  Uneven Outcomes in the Labor Market Conference  Washington, D.C.  (virtual)         February 7, 2024  Mandate for Maximum Employment  Good afternoon and welcome to the third day of the Federal Reserve’s Uneven Outcomes in the Labor Market C onference.1  It is a pleasure to join so many researchers, policymakers, and practitioners interested in understanding the labor market and its implications for the overall economy and the financial wellbeing of workers."
" As many of you are aware, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has a mandate to effectively promote maximum employment and price stability ."
 There are many pathways for workers to find employment.
" In fact, the Census Bureau’s November 2023 analysis of business applications shows that business formation since 2021 has remained 32 percent higher than in the previous ten years.4  Many of these new businesses were started by minority business owners.5  Increased rates of workers voluntarily quitting their jobs and high levels of unemployment during the pandemic appear to have encouraged some workers to become self -employed  or become  entrepreneurs."
 This growth in start -up businesses could help to address the challenge of closing employment gaps for workers who typically face the greatest headwinds in the labor market.
" For example, start -ups are more likely to hire new workers and workers with lower levels of educational attainment.6  New businesses have also been responsible for a surprising amount of job growth, with an average of nearly one million jobs created each quarter from early 2021 through the beginning of 2023, which is a significantly higher pace than was typical prior to the pandemic.7    3 August Benzow and Nora Esposito, “ Minority - and Women -Owned Businesses Tend to be Younger, Making them More Vulnerable in the Coming Recession ,” Economic Innovation Group , August 2020 , https://eig.org/minority -andwomen- owned -businessesvulnerable -recession ."
" Otherwise, they may underperform, not reaching their growth potential either in revenue or employment."
" Moreover, personal financial resources are often limited, which  can constrain growth."
" Ideally, small businesses should be able to access external funding, which can be a key to their growth and stability."
  Conclusion  The Fed continues to support the growth of startups and small businesses as a means of creating opportunity for all workers.
