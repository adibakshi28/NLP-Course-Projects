"WallerMember Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve SystemFebruary 18, 2022Views are my own and do not represent any position of the Board of Governors or other Federal Reserve policymakers.1•The authors discuss three impacts from running a “hot” economy: labor market inclusiveness, potential financial market instability and a greater risk of excessive inflation."
"•Since time is short, I will focus most of my comments on the benefits of labor market inclusiveness.2•The Federal Reserve’s new framework states that “full employment is a broadbased and inclusive goal.” •A challenge for policymakers is to try and determine when that goal has been achieved."
"•One interpretation is that it is when all groups have similar labor market outcomes according to various metrics.3•For example, those metrics could include unemployment rates, employment -topopulation ratios and labor force participation rates.•If these metrics do not show similar labor market outcomes, the question then becomes, “what can monetary policy do to improve these metrics?”4•The evidence from the authors’ research is that economic expansions show a strong narrowing of differentials for unemployment rates across groups.•And, only weak evidence for narrowing of labor force participation rates.•This is for prime age workers (25 -54)—not very inclusive to people my age!  The good news is I find it true for prime age and all workers.5•What should unemployment rates look like in a racially blind, gender -neutral labor market?"
"•Given a certain matching efficiency, job finding and job separation rate, an equilibrium unemployment rate is generated."
"•If these colors are meaningless attributes, then all groups will have the same unemployment rate and the ratios will be 1."
"•Education ratios, because of differences in productivity, will not be 1.7•By looking at the ratio, we get a measure of relativedifferences as opposed to absolute differences.•Looking at relative differences gives a better view of improving (or worsening) situations than absolute differences.•It measures gains and losses in percentage terms.8•Consider income; someone makes $100,000 and someone else makes $50,000.•Now double both incomes; the first person will still make twice as much."
"•Second, is there a trend in these ratios toward 1 (improvement) or away from 1 (worsening)?•Third, do these ratios display cyclical variations that could be affected by monetary policy?10Takeaways:1) Ratio greater than 1."
 Women experienced large unemployment at the start of  the COVID shock.
 Men experienced larger unemployment in previous recessions.14Takeaways:1) Ratio greater than 1 but not surprising.2) Clear downward trend.3) No apparent cyclical variation.15Takeaways:1) Ratio greater than 1 but not surprising.2) No apparent trend.3) No apparent cyclical variation.16Takeaways:1) Ratio greater than 1 but not surprising.2) No apparent trend.3) No apparent cyclical variation.17•So what conclusions do I draw from this data?
" •It is unlikely that this type of improvement is directly driven by monetary policy.18•Third, running the economy “hot” does improve the relative performance for some groups, but not all, when comparing unemployment rates.•In particular, longer expansions improve job finding rates for Black workers.•Doing a similar exercise using relative employment to population ratios also shows improvement for Black and Hispanic workers.19Empirical Studies•Aaronson, Stephanie R., Mary C."
