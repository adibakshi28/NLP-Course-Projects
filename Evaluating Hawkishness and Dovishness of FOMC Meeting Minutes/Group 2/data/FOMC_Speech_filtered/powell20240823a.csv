"Powell   Chair   Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at  “Reassessing the Effectiveness and Transmission of Monetary Policy ,”  an economic symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  Jackson Hole, Wyoming        August 23, 2024   Four  and a half years after COVID19’s arrival, the worst of the pandemic -related economic distortions are fading."
" Our objective has been to restore price stability while maintaining a strong labor market, avoiding the sharp increases in unemployment that characterized earlier disinflationary episodes when infla tion expectations were less well anchored."
"Today, I will begin by addressing the current economic situation and the path ahead for monetary policy."
" I will then turn to a discussion of economic events since the pandemic arrived, exploring why inflation rose to levels not seen in a generation, and why it has  fallen so much while unemployment has remained low ."
"  For much of the past three years, inflation ran well above our 2 percent goal, and labor market conditions were extremely tight."
" The Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) primary focus has been on bringing down inflation, and appropriately so."
" Prior to this episode, most A mericans alive today had not experienced the pain of high inflation for a sustained period."
" Inflation brought substantial hardship, especially for those least  - 2 - able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation."
" H igh inflation triggered stress and a sense of unfairness that linger today.1 Our restrictive monetary policy helped restore balance between aggregate supply and demand, easing inflationary pressures and ensuring that inflation expectations remained well anchored."
" Inflation is now much closer to our objective, with prices having risen 2.5 percent over the past 12 months  (figure 1).2  After a pause earlier this year, progress toward our 2 percent objective has resumed."
 My confidence ha s grow n that inflation is on a sustainable path back to 2 percent .
"Turning to employment , in the years just prior to the pandemic, we saw the significant benefits to society that can come from a long period of strong labor market conditions:  low unemployment, high participation, historically low racial employment gaps, and, with inflation low and stable, healthy real wage gains that were increasingly concentrated among those with lower incomes.3   Today, the labor market has cooled considerably from its formerly overheated state."
" The unemployment rate began to rise over a year ago and is now at 4.3 percent —still low by historical standards, but almost a full percentage point above its level in early 2023 (figure 2)."
" So far, rising  1 Shiller (1997) and Stantcheva (2024) study why people dislike inflation."
 Pfafjar and Winkler (2024) study households’ attitudes toward inflation and unemployment.
" Binetti, Nuzzi, and Stantcheva (2024) investigate households’ attitudes toward, and understanding of, inflation."
 Kaplan and Schulhofer -Wohl (2017) and Jaravel (2021) document heterogeneity in the inflation rate experienced by households across the income distribution.
" While such an estimate is subject to uncertainty, it suggests that inflation remained near 2.5 percent through July."
"  - 3 - unemployment has not  been the result of elevated layoffs, as is typically the case in an economic downturn."
" Job gains remain solid but have slowed this year .4  Job vacancies have fallen, and the ratio of vacancies to unemployment has returned to its pre -pandemic  range ."
" All told, labor market conditions are now less tight  than  just before the pandemic in 2019—a  year when inflation ran below 2 percent."
 It seems unlikely that the labor market will be a source of elevated inflationary pressures anytime soon.
 But t he inflation and labor market data show a n evolving situation.
 The  upside risks to inflation have diminished.
 And the downside risks to employment have increased.
"    4 Payroll employment grew by an average of 170,000 per month over the three months ending in July."
" T he preliminary estimate indicates a downward adjustment to March 202 4 total nonfarm employment of 818,000."
" With an appropriate dialing back of policy restraint, there is good reason to think that the economy will get back to 2 percent inflation while maintaining a s trong labor market."
"The Rise and Fall of Inflation  Let’s now turn to the questions  of why inflation rose, and why it has fallen so significantly even as unemployment has remained low ."
" But pent -up demand, stimulative policies, pandemic changes in work and leisure practices, and the additional savings associated with constrained services spending all contributed to a historic surge in consumer spending on goods ."
" T he labor force would not return to its pre -pandemic trend until mid -2023 (figure 3) .6  Supply chains were snarled by a combination of lost workers, disrupted international trade linkages, and tectonic shifts in the composition and level of demand (figure 4) ."
  Enter inflation.
" After running below target through 2020, inflation spiked in March and April 2021."
" The initial burst of inflation was concentrated rather than broad based, with extremely large price increases for goods in short supply, such as motor  6 The Federal Reserve Board staff’s estimate of the labor force makes two adjustments to the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ published estimates: (i) reweighing Current Population Survey respondents such that the labor force estimates in all years reflect the Census Bureau’s latest vintage of population estimates; and (ii) accountin g for net immigration that is likely not fully reflected in the Census Bureau’s latest population estimates, as detailed in the CBO’s 2024 Demographic Outlook (see https://www.cbo.gov/publication/59899)."
 The pre -pandemic trend described here is calculated  by appending the CBO’s January 2020 projected labor force growth from the start of the pandemic through 2024:Q2 onto the level of the labor force just before the start of the pandemic.
" My colleagues and I judged at the outset that these pandemic -related factors would not be persistent and, thus , that the sudden rise in inflation was likely to pass through fairly quickly without the need for a monetary policy response —in short, that the inflation would be transitory."
" Standard thinking has long been that, as long as inflation expectations remain well anchored, it can be appropriate for central banks to look through a temporary rise in inflation.7   The good ship Transitory was a crowded one, with most mainstream analysts and advanced -economy central bankers  on board.8  The common expectation was that supply conditions would improve reasonably quickly, that the rapid recovery in demand would run its course , and that demand would rotate back from goods to services, bringing inflation down."
" Monthly readings for core inflation declined every month from April to September 2021 , although progress came slower than expected (figure 5) ."
" Beginning in October, the data turned hard against the transitory hypothesis.9  Inflation rose and broadened out from goods into  7 For example, former Chair Ben Bernanke and Olivier Blanchard summarize the standard approach in their work on inflation the following way:  “Standard central banking doctrine holds that, so long as inflation expectations are reasonably well anchored, there is a case for ‘looking through’ temporary supply shocks rather than responding to the short -run increase in inflation”  (Blanchard and Bernanke, 2024, p."
" Clarida (forthcoming) notes how central banks around the world faced a sharp rise in the relative price of goods and chose, at least initially, to accommodate the price pressures with an expected transitory increase in inflation."
" 8 In the September 2021 Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), the median projection for headline inflation in 2022 was 2.2 percent."
" In the August 2021 Survey of Professional Forecasters (the closest survey to the September SEP), the median projection for headline inflation in 2022 was also 2.2 percent."
" 9 Beginning with the data for October, readings for monthly core PCE jumped to 0.4 percent or higher and inflationary pressures broadened out across goods and services categories."
 Measures of wage inflation also accelerated.
" I t became clear that the high inflation was not transitory, and that it would require a strong policy response if inflation expectations were to remain well  anchored ."
" By early 2022, headline inflation exceeded 6 percent, with core inflation above 5 percent."
" The improvements in supply conditions and rotation in demand from goods to services were taking much longer than expected, in part due to further COVID waves in the U .S.10  And COVID continued to disrupt production globally, including through new and extended lockdowns in China.11   High rates of inflation were a global phenomenon, reflecting common experiences:  rapid increases in the demand for goods, strained supply chains, tight labor markets, and sharp hikes in commodity prices.12  The global nature of inflation was unlike any period since the 1970s ."
" Back then, high inflation became entrenched—an outcome we were utterly committed to avoiding."
" This increase in labor demand was met, in part, by w orkers rejoining the labor force as health concerns began to fade."
"12 The global nature of this inflationary episode is emphasized in Cascaldi -Garcia and others (2024) and Clarida (forthcoming) , among others ."
" There were nearly twice as many job openings as unemployed persons from March 2022 through the end of the year, signaling a severe labor shortage (figure 6 ).13  Inflation peaked at 7.1 percent in June 2022."
"At this podium two years ago, I discussed the possibility that addressing inflation could bring some pain in the form of higher unemployment and slower growth."
 Some  argued that getting inflation under control would require a recession and a lengthy period of high unemployment.14  I expressed our unconditional commitment to fully restoring price stability and to keeping at it until the job is done.
 The summer of 2022 proved to be the peak of inflation.
 T he 41/2 percentage point decline in inflation from its peak two years ago has occurred in a context of low unemployment —a welcome and historically unusual result.
 How did inflation fall without a sharp rise in unemployment above its estimated natural rate?
" Pandemic -related  distortions to supply and demand, as well as severe shocks to energy and commodity markets, were important drivers of high inflation, and their  13 It has been argued that the natural rate of unemployment had risen , and that the unemployment rate was less informative about tightness in labor market than other measures such as those involving vacancies."
" More generally, research has emphasized that the unemployment rate and the ratio of vacancies to unemployment often provide similar signals, but the signals differed in the pandemic period , and the ratio of vacancies to unemployment is a better overall indicator."
" 14 For example, Ball, Leigh, and Mishra (2022) and Cecchetti and others (2023) present analyses emphasizing that disinflation would require economic slack."
 The unwinding of these factors took much longer than expected but ultimately played a large role in  the subsequent disinflation.
" Our restrictive monetary policy contributed to a moderation in aggregate demand, which  combined with improvements in aggregate supply to re duce inflationary pressures while allowing growth to continue at a healthy pace."
" As labor demand also moderated, the  historically high level of vacancies relative to unemployment has normalized primarily through a decline in vacancies, without sizable and disruptive layoffs , bringing the labor market to a state where it is no longer a source of inflationary pressures."
  A word on the critical importance of inflation expectations.
 Standard economic models have long reflected the view that inflation will return to its objective when product and labor markets are balanced—without the need for economic slack—so long as inflation expectations are anchored at our objective.
" That’s what the models said, but the stability of longer -run inflation expectations since the 2000s had not been tested by a persistent burst of high inflation."
 I t was far from assured that the inflation a nchor would hold.
 Concerns over de -anchoring contributed to the view that disinflation would require slack in the economy and specifically in the labor market.
" An important takeaway from recent experience is that anchored inflation expectations, reinforc ed by vigorous central bank actions, can facilitate disinflation without the need for slack."
This narrative attributes much of the increase in inflation to an  extraordinary collision between overheated and temporarily distorted demand and constrained supply.
" While researchers differ in their approaches and, to some extent, in their conclusions , a consensus seems to be emerging, which I see as attribut ing most of the rise in inflation to  - 10 - this collision .15  All told, the healing from pandemic distortions, our efforts to moderate aggregate demand, and the anchoring of expectations have worked together to put inflation on what increasingly appears to be a sustainable path to our 2 percent objective."
"  Disinflation while preserving labor market strength is  only possible with anchored inflation expectations, which reflect the public’s confidence that the central bank will bring about 2 percent inflation over time."
 Our Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy emphasizes our commitment to reviewing our principles and making appropriate adjustments through a thorough public review every five years.
 The limits of our knowledge —so clearly evident during the pandemic —demand humility and a questioning spirit focused on learni ng lessons from the past and applying them flexibly to our current challenges.
 Di Giovanni and others (2022) and Bai and others (2024) use different techniques and emphasize supply constraints and shocks in the increase in inflation over 2021 and 2022.
