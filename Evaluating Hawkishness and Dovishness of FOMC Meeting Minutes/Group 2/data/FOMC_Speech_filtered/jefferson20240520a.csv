" Second, I’ll discuss my thinking on the current stance of monetary policy."
" Third, I’ll review the dynamics of housing prices which can feed into the persistence of inflation."
 The housing sector  is also one of the most interest rate–sensitive sectors of the economy.
" A s such , it’s an important channel of monetary policy transmission ."
Understanding the various channels of monetary transmission is crucial to fulfillment of the dual mandate given to the Federal Reserve by the Congress:  maximum employment and stable prices.
  This mandate guides my thinking about monetary policymaking.
 Aggregate Economic Activity  The U.S. economy continues to grow at a solid  pace.
" Adjusted for inflation, GDP was reported to have increased at a 1.6 percent annual rate in the first quarter  of 2024."
  - 2 - demand —grew 3.1 percent in the first quarter.
" Nevertheless, I expect spending growth to slow later this year as restrictive monetary policy weighs on demand, particularly on interestsensitive spending."
 I will be monitoring incoming data to understand better how much more help we will get from the supply side to bring inflation down further.
" Still, employers added an average of 242,000 jobs in the three months ended in April, and t he unemployment rate remained below 4 percent last month."
The supply of workers and the demand for labor continue to come into better balance.
 This r ebalancing of the labor market has resulted in nominal wage growth easing even as unemployment remains historically low.
"  Inflation   Of course , I have been keeping a close eye on inflation."
" The good news is that inflation has eased dramatically from the peak reached almost two years ago, as shown in  - 3 - figure 3."
" However, inflation remains above the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) 2 percent inflation objective ."
 It is too early to tell whether the recent slowdown in the disinflationary process will be long lasting.
"  Fortunately, data on expectations suggest that the FOMC’s inflationfighting credibility remains intact."
"  While there has been a recent uptick in Americans’ inflation expectations over the next 12 months, longterm inflation expectations, over the next 10 years, remain close to prepandemic levels ."
 That  shows the American people believe that we will make good on our commitment to bring inflation fully back to our objective .
" I am acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship as it erodes p urchasing power, especially for those on fixed incomes and those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials , including housing, transportation, and food."
 That is why my colleagues at the Fed and I are so committed to returning inflation to our target.
"Monetary Policy   So,  what does the current state of the economy mean for the policy rate we set at the Fed?"
" I believe that our policy rate is in restrictive territory as we continue to see the labor market come into better balance, and inflation decline although nowhere near as quickly as I would have liked."
 The FOMC noted that it does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent.
"We will reinvest any proceeds in excess of this cap in Treasury securities , as detailed in the May 1, 2024 operating policy statement published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York .2  The Housing Market   The Fed sets policy to promote its dualma ndate objectives of maximum employment and price stability, and employment and inflation depend on conditions in the entire economy."
" - 5 - As I said earlier , the housing sector is one of the most interest rate–sensitive parts of the economy."
 The current  restrictive stance of monetary policy has weighed on the housing market.
 That is help ing to bring supply and demand into better balance and put downward pressure on inflation.
 One aspect of inflation that has gotten a fair amount of attention is housing and rental costs.
" To calculate housing services inflation, government statistics don’t use home prices because a home is partly an investment."
" Instead, housing services inflation is computed using monthly rents that capture what tenants pay to rent a house or apartment and what homeowners would, in theory, pay to rent their  own home."
" In this figure, notice that increases in market rents, the blue and red line s, peaked in 2022, and PCE housing services inflation, the black  line, lagged market rents and peaked in 2023."
 Lags in Housing  Services Inflation  The primary reason for this lag is that market rents adjust more quickly to economic conditions than what landlords charge their existing tenants.
 This  lag suggests that the large increase in market rents during the pandemic is still being passed through to  - 6 - existing rents and may keep housing services inflation elevated for a while longer.
 This observation is important because it is an example of one of the underlying sources of lags with which monetary policy affects inflation.
Another factor affecting passthrough of restrictive monetary policy is that fixed -rate mortgages are common in the U.S.  It is often argued that this loan structure dampens the effect of monetary policy.
" Fixed -rate mor tgages do dampen the effect of monetary policy, but, according to recent research, not as much as previously thought.3   There is a delay between  when mortgage rates go up and  when household mortgage payments go up, as shown in figure 7."
 The cumulative effect of a higher interest rate on aggregate mortgage payments grows over time as more new loans are originated at the higher rate.
"  3 See, for example, Daniel  Ringo (2024) , “Inframarginal Borrowers and the Mortgage Payment Channel of Monetary Policy,” working paper, May."
"  - 7 - The staff’s research documents that, historically, borrowers like these who are not deterred by higher rates are responsible for a little over half of the passthrough of interest rates to mortgage payments."
  The housing sector is also a key part of the transmission mechanism of monetary policy.
"  Of course,  no one sector dictates monetary policy."
 We look at the totality of the data to set policy and achieve the objectives given to the Fed by Congress:  maximum employment and price stability.
"Considering the lagged  effects of monetary policy, I am encouraged that over the past two  years, we have made good progress toward our dualmandate objectives."
