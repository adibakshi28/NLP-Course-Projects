"   For release on delivery  5:00 p.m. EDT  April 4, 2013         Communication in Monetary Policy     Remarks by   Janet L."
"Yellen   Vice Chair   Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at  Society of American Business Editors and Writers  50th Anniversary Conference   Washington, D.C.        April 4, 2013  Thank you for inviting me here and for offering me what I consider a perfect opportunity to speak on a topic at the heart of the Federal Reserve’s efforts to promote a stronger economy --the vital role and growing use of communication in monetary policy.1  Some of you cover the Federal Reserve and are familiar with how it sets monetary policy through the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) ."
 I hope to show how communication plays a distinct and special role in monetary policymaking.
"  Suppose, instead of monetary policy, we were talking about an example of transportation policy --widening a road to ease traffic congestion."
  At the heart of everything I’ll be explaining today is the fact that monetary policy is different.
" The effects of monetary policy depend critically on the public getting the message about what policy will do months or years in the future.2   To develop t his idea, I will take you on a tour of past  FOMC communication , the present , and what I foresee for the future."
" Until fairly recently , most  central banks actively avoided communicating about monetary policy."
" Next , I’ll relate how the financial crisis brought unprecedented challenges for monetary policy  that required  the use of unconventional policy tools , including some barely contemplated before the crisis ."
" I am encouraged by recent signs that the economy is improving and healing from the trauma of th e crisis, and I expect that, at some point , the FOMC will return to a more  normal  approach to monetary policy."
" As these remarks go on to explain, unlike most government policy action s, monetary policy is primarily concerned with affecting expectations of the future."
 It’s a revolution in our understanding of how communication can influence the effectiveness of monetary policy.
"  The FOMC’s job, as signed by the Congress, is to use monetary policy to promote maximum employment and stable prices, objectives that together are known as the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate."
"  In normal times, the Committee pursues these goals by influencing  the level of a s hortterm interest rate called the federal funds rate, which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans ."
" When the FOMC pushes the federal funds rate up or down, other short -term interest rates normally move in tandem."
" Medium - and longer -term interest rates, including auto loan rates and mortgage rates, generally adjust also, through a mechanism I will return to in a moment."
" By pushing the federal funds rate up or down, the FOMC seeks to influence a wide range of interest rates that matter to hou seholds and businesses."
" Typically, t he FOMC act s to lower the federal funds rate, with the intention of reducing interest rates  generally , when the economy is weak ening  or inflation is declining below the Committee’s longer -run objective ."
 The FOMC raises  the federal funds rat e when inflation threatens to rise above its  objective or when economic activity appears likely to rise above sustainable levels .
"   It is hard to imagine now, but only two decades ago, the Federal Reserve and other central banks provided the public with very little information about such monetary policy moves --the spirit of “n ever explain ” was very much alive."
 Some believed that markets would ove rreact to details about monetary policy decisions.
" In sum, the con ventional wisdom among central bankers was  that transparency was of little benefit for monetary policy and, in some cases , could cause problems that would make policy less effective."
 It wasn’t until February 1994 that the Committee issued a postmeeting statement  disclosing a change in monetary policy .
 The ree valuation starts with a question that puzzled many of my students when I was a professor:  H ow is it that the Federal Reserve manages to move a vast  economy just by raising or lower ing the interest rate on overnight loans by 1/4 of a percentage point?
"  - 6 - depend on expectations of income, employment, and other economic conditions  over the longer term, as well as longer -term interest rates ."
 But  the effects of today’s monetary policy actions are largely due to the effect they have on expectations about how policy will be set over the medium term.
" Starting in the mid -1960s, the Federal Reserve did n’t act forcefully in the face of rising inflation , and the public grew less certain of the central bank’s commitment to fighting inflation."
 This uncertainty led expectations of future inflation to become “unanchored” and more likely to react to economic developments.
" In 1973, an oil price shock led to a large increase in overall inflation."
" Expectations of higher inflation in the future affected the public’s behavior --workers demanded raises , and businesses set prices and otherwise acted in anticipation of                                                  5 Another factor that adds to the importance of expectations is that changes in monetary policy affect real activity and inflation with a substantia l time lag."
  - 7 - higher costs --and this helped fuel  actual inflation .
 The FOMC ’s occasional efforts to  reduce inflation in the 1970s were ineffective partly due to the expectation that it ultimately wouldn’t do enough.
" By contrast, most of you probably know about the F ederal Reserve’s successful inflation fighting in the early 1980s."
" The FOMC raised the federal funds rate very high, causing a deep recession but also convincing the public that it was committed to low and stable  inflation ."
 Anchoring inflation expectations at low levels helped ensure that jumps in commodity prices or other supply shocks would not generate persistent inflation problems .
" Unlike in the 1970s, these pric e shocks did not result in a broad and lasting increase in overall inflation because the public believed the Federal Reserve would keep inflation in check."
 The FOMC wasn’t forced to raise interest rates --which softened the blow of higher fuel costs on households and businesses --because of  the credibility the Federal Reserve had built since the 1980s.
"If the public’s expectations have always been important, you might wonder how monetary policy had any effect prior to the transparency revolution."
" In 1993,  economist John Taylor documented that FOMC policy changes since the mid -1980s had fairly reliably followed a sim ple rule based on inflation and output."
" It had cut the federal funds rate to the very low level of 1  percent , but unemployment remained elevated, and the FOMC sought some further way to stimulate  the economy."
" For the first time, the Committee was using communication--mere words --as its primary monetary policy  tool."
 Monetary Policy  since the Onset of the Financial Crisis  The situation in 2008 and 2009 was like nothing the Federal Reserve had faced since the 1930s.
" With its traditional tool for expansionary monetary policy --lowering the federal funds rate --off the table,  the FOMC turned to unconventional  and, in some cases , newly  invented policy options to try both to help stabilize the financial system and to arrest the plunge in economic activity ."
" The public had grown accustomed to monetary policy that focused on changes to the federal funds rate target, wi th occasional , and at this point fairly limited , guidance that a particular policy  stance would probably last for a while."
" Beyond the task of describing the new policies, extensive new communication was needed to justify these  - 10 - unconventional policy actions and convincingly connect them  to the Federal Reserve’s employment and inflation objectives."
"These purchases were intended t o, and I believe have, succeeded in significantly lowering long erterm interest rates and raising asset prices  to help further the Federal Reserve’s economic objectives."
" This is  an easing of monetary policy, also known as  accommodation, beyond what is provided by maintaining the federal funds rate close to zero ."
" - 12 - policy  strateg y.10  This statement laid out, for the first time , the rates  of inflation and unemployment that th e FOMC considers consistent with the dual mandate ."
" Specifically, it stated that the longer -run inflation goal most consistent with the FOMC’s price stability mandate is 2 percent, and that the central tendency of FOMC participants’ estimates of the longer -run normal rate of unemployment ranged from 5.2 to 6 percent."
" As the statement also made clear, economic developments may cause inflation and unemployment to temporarily move away from the objectives, and the Committee will use a balanced approach to ret urn both, over time , to the longer -run goals ."
" On the one hand, for example, the current rate of unemployment, at 7.7 percent, is f ar above the 5.2 to 6 percent  range in the statement and is expected to decline only gradually."
" Inflation, on the other hand, has been running at or below 2 percent and is expected to remain at similar level s for several years."
" In this circumstance , both legs of the dual mandate cal l for a highly accommodative monetary policy ."
" With unemployment so far from its longer -run normal level, I believe progress on reducing unemployment should take center stage for the FOMC, even if maintaining that progress might result in inflation slightl y and temporarily exceeding 2 percent."
" The Committee reaffirmed this statement in January 2013, and I expect it to remain a valuable roadmap for many years to come , indicating h ow monetary policy will respond to changes in economic conditions.11                                                  10 See Board  of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2012), “Federal Reserve Issues FOMC Statement of Longer -Run Goals and Policy Strategy ,” press release, January 25 , www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20120125c.htm ."
"11 See “Statement  on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy,” as amended effective January 29, 2013, on the Board’s website at www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_LongerRunGoals.pdf ."
" - 13 - Meanwhile,  the FOMC has continued to enhance its communication about how it would use the federal funds rate to return inflation and unemployment to its longer -run objectives."
"  Specifically, the Committee said it anticipates that exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate will be appropriate “at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6 -1/2 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee’s 2 percent longer -run goal, and longer -term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored.”12   I consider these thresholds for possible action a major improvement in forward guidance."
" As for the date at which tightening of monetary policy is likely to occur, market participants, armed with this new information about the Committee ’s “reaction function,”  can form their own judgment and alter their expectations on timing as new information accrues over time."
  - 14 - public should expect a later “lift off” in rates --an expectation that would reduce longer -term interest rates and thereby provide moreaccommodative financial conditions.
 Communication and Monetary Policy Challenges Ahead  The threshold guidance for the federal funds rate looks ahead to a time when the economy has healed from the worst effects of the financial crisis.
 Getting back to more normal economic conditions will allow for a more normal approach to monetary policy.
" In its March statement, the FOMC reaffirmed its expectation that a highly a ccommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the current asset purchase program ends  and the economic recovery has strengthened .14  Accordingly, there will likely be a substantial period after asset purchases conclude but before the  FOMC  starts removing accommodation by reducing asset holdings  or raising the federal funds rate ."
" But the course of the economy is uncertain, and the Committee added the thresholds for unemployment and inflation, in part, to help guide the public if economic developments warrant liftoff sooner or later than expected."
  I hope I’ve been able today to convey the vital role that communication plays in the Federal Reserve’s efforts to promote maximum employment and stable prices.
 Better times and a transition away from unconventional policies may make monetary policy less reliant on communication.
