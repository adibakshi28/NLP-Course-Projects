"For release on delivery 3:00 p.m. EDT April 16, 2013           Panel Discussion on “Monetary Policy: Many Targets, Many Instruments."
" Before the financial crisis, the focus was on one policy instrument:  the shortterm policy interest rate."
" While central banks did not uniformly rely on a single pol icy target, many had adopted an “inflation targeting” framework that, as the name implie s, gives a certain preeminence to that one objective."
" By one authoritative account, about 27 countries now operate fullfl edged inflationtargeting regimes.2  The United States is not on this list, but the Federal Rese rve has embraced most of  the key features of flexible inflation targeting:  a commitment to promote low and stable inflation over a longerterm horizon, a predictable moneta ry policy, and clear and transparent communication."
 The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) struggled for years to formulate an inflation goal that would not seem  to give preference to price stability over                                                  1 The views I express here are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.
"  2 See Gill Hammond (2012), State of the Art of Inflation Targeting , Centre for Central Banking Studies, CCBS Handbook No. 29 (London:  Bank of England), www.bankofengland.co.uk/education/Documents/ccbs/handbooks/pdf/ccbshb29.pdf."
   - 2 -maximum employment.
" In January 2012, the Committee adopted a “Statement on LongerRun Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy,” which includes a 2 percent longerrun inflation goal along with nume rical estimates of what the Committee views as the longerrun normal rate of unemployment."
 The statement also makes clear that the FOMC will take a “balanced approach” in seeking to mitigate deviations of inflation from 2 percent and employment from estimates of its maximum sustainable level.
 I see this language as entirely consistent with modern descripti ons of flexible inflation targeting.
"  For the past four years, a major challe nge for the Federal Reserve and many other central banks has been how to address persistently high unemployment when the policy rate is at or near the e ffective lower bound."
" I have been very keen, however, to retain what  I see as the key ingredient of a flexible inflationtargeting framework:  clear comm unication about goals and how central banks intend to achieve them."
"  With respect to the Federal Reserve’ s goals, price stab ility and maximum employment are not only mandated by the C ongress, but also easily understandable and widely embraced."
 Wellanchored inflation e xpectations have proven to be an immense asset in conducting monetary po licy.
 They’ve helped keep in flation low and stable while monetary policy has been used to help promot e a healthy economy.
" After the onset of the financial crisis, these stable expectations al so helped the United States avoid excessive disinflation or even deflation."
  The objective of forward guida nce is to affect expect ations about how long the highly accommodative stance of th e policy interest rate will be  maintained as conditions improve.
" By lowering privatesector expectations  of the future path of shortterm rates, this guidance can reduce longerterm interest rates and also raise asset prices, in turn, stimulating aggregate demand."
" Since September 2012, the FOMC has stated that a highly accommodative stance of  monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the economic recovery strengthens."
" Since December 2012, the Committee has said it intend s to hold the federal funds rate near zero at least until unemployment ha s declined below 61/2 percen t, provided that inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than 1/2 percentage point above the Committee’s 2 percent longerrun goal , and longerterm inflation expectations continue to be well anchore d."
" As Chairman Be rnanke has observed, in the years before the crisis, financial stability became a “junior pa rtner” in the monetary policy process, in contrast with its traditionally larger role."
" I don’t see pervasive evidence of rapid credit growth, a marked buildup in levera ge, or significant asset bubbles that would threaten financial stability."
"  However, I think most central bankers vi ew monetary policy as a blunt tool for addressing financial stability concerns  and many probably share my own strong preference to rely on microand macropruden tial supervision and regulation as the main line of defense."
  Let me conclude by noting that I have touched on only some of the important dimensions of monetary policy targets and instru ments that have arisen in recent years.
