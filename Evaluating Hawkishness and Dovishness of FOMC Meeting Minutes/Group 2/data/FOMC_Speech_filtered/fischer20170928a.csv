"For release on delivery  10:00 a.m. EDT (3: 00 p.m. local time ) September 28, 2017         The Independent Bank of England-- 20 Years On    Remarks by   Stanley Fischer   Vice Chair man  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at  “20 Years On,” a conference sponsored by   the Bank of England  London, England         September 28 , 2017   It is a pleasure to speak at this commemoration of 20 years of Bank of England monetary policy independence."
" In the first part, I will discuss several aspects of aggregate monetary policy:  central bank independence, policy transparency, and policy tools."
" Revisiting Goal Independence versus Instrument  Independence  We start by considering a central bank that influences economic activity only through its influence over the general level of interest rates.2  More than two decades ago, Guy Debelle and I offered two terms --goal independence  and instrument  independence --to describe such a central bank’s degree of independence."
 Our definitions were as follows:  “A central bank has goal independence  when it is free to set the final goals of monetary policy.
 2 The implications for monetary policy of central bank actions other than the use of its general monetary policy tools will be considered later.
 4 U.S. monetary policy independence in the post -World War II era dates at least from the Federal Reserve/Treasury Accord of 1951.
" - 2 -   Under the new law, the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), rather than the Treasury, set the policy interest rate."
" Inflation targeting, which began in the United Kingdom in 1992, continued under the new system and was codified in the Bank of England Act of 1998.5  The MPC was given an explicit numerical inflation target, corresp onding to effective price stability, alongside an implied stabilization goal for real economic activity.6  Consequently, the Bank of England from 1997 had  the combination that Debelle and I advocated:  instrument independence but not goal independence."
 We also judged that the vagueness of the Federal Reserve’s statutory objectives meant that the Federal Reserve “has considerable goal independence.”7  Today both the FOMC and the MPC have a numerical inflation goal --2 percent.
" In the United Kingdom, the Chancellor of the Exchequer sets the MPC’s inflation target:  currently 2 percent per year for the U.K. c onsumer price index.8  In the United States, in the FOMC’s  Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, first issued in 2012 and discussed annually, Committee participants have judged that the longer -run inflation objective that                                                     5 See the text of the act in Bank of England (2015a)."
" See Bank of England (2017a).)  6 From the start of inflation targeting in the United Kingdom in 1992, it was made clear that the authorities, when faced with a situation in which inflation was different from the target rate, would generally not  seek to restore inflation to tar get as quickly as possible."
" Rather, they typically would opt for a policy that sought to bring inflation back to target gradually, without unnecessary destabilization of real output."
" It is an approach consistent with the MPC’s remit in the Bank of England Act 1998 to achieve the inflation target through policies consistent with the economic policy of the U.K. government, “including its objectives for growth and employment.”  7 See Debelle and Fischer (1994, p."
" 8 For the most recent statement by the Chancellor of the Exchequer on the inflation target to be pursued by the MPC, see Hammond (2017)."
 But there is a subtle difference between  them in terms of who sets the inflation target.
" To date, that difference has not generated any major divergence between the approaches to monetary policy of the two central banks."
" First, instrument indepe ndence  requires the central bank to make  technical judgments about the instrument settings most appropriate for achieving  the statutory goals --and this choice is typically based on a discussion of the central bank’s monetary policy committee , informed by  the analysis of its staff."
" Second, mo netary policy decisions aim at affecting economy -wide interest rates  and, thereby, aggregate economic behavior."
" The aims and tools of monetary policy are therefore distinct from those of fiscal policy --whose instrument s of taxation , government purchases, and transfer payments are often used in the pursuit of distributional or region -specific objectives."
" Historically, this judgment has been the most prominent part of the cas e for central bank independence.10  Fourth, the same arrangement precludes the monetary authority from seeking  the short -run boost to economic activity that might be associated with a permanent increase in the inflation rate."
" Fifth, this arrangement seeks to avoid undesirably low inflation :  The policy committee, in pursuing  a symmetric inflation objective , should provide accommodation when needed to prevent inflation from being persistently below that objective."
" These were points the FOMC recognized in its Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, which observed that clarity concerning policy decis ions “increases the effectiveness of monetary policy, and enhances transparency  and                                                    10 For further discussion, see, for example, Bernanke  (2010), Debelle and Fischer (1994, p."
 Calls for more transparency concerning U.K. monetary policy and the Bank of England’s monetary actions predated independence.
" In 1993, it initiated the Inflation Report ."
" From the beginning, the Inflation Report  was intended to increase transparency about the U.K. monetary policy reaction function-- that is, the connection between policy instruments and economic variables, including the goal variables.15  After independence, the Inflation Report  presented the MPC’s inflation forecast."
" Furthermore, alongside other Bank statements, the Inflation Report  provides a publicly available analysis of the economy and of economic implications of developments like Brexit."
" - 6 - Bank’s change in focus --from markets in the pre -inflation -targeting era to macroeconomic implications of financial and other developments.16 The Bank expanded its policy comm unications after 1997, publishing MPC analogues to the FOMC releases  (some of them only recent innovations by the Fed):  postmeeting MPC statements and meeting minutes."
 And an innovation of Mervyn King in the early years of inflation targeting that has co ntinued in the era of independence is the Inflation Report press conference.
 New Monetary Policy Tools  The MPC and FOMC have extensively --particularly in recent years --used two monetary policy tools other than  decisions on the  current short -term interest rate.
" These tools are forward guidance and asset purchases .17 Monetary authorities used to be very reluctant to discuss the future course of the policy rate.18  By 1997, however, there was widespread recognition of the merits of                                                    16 The MPC arrangements also require that a l etter be  written from the Bank Governor to the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the event of an overshoot or undershoot of the inflation target that is in excess of 1 percent."
" As well as providing accountability, this arrangement  gives the Bank an opportuni ty to emphasize the longer -term nature of the inflation goal and the consideration given in MPC policy decisions to the stabilization of real economic activity."
" For example, Carney (2016)  outlined, among other things, “the horizon over which the MPC judge s it appropriate to return inflation to the target” and “the trade -off that has been made with regard to inflation and output variability in determining the scale and duration of any expected deviation of inflation from the target.”  17 In addition to these tools, the MPC has used the Funding for Lending Scheme to boost bank lending."
"717):  “Federal Reserve of ficials are extremely careful to avoid any public comment that might suggest or imply some particular outlook for interest rates.”  In the United Kingdom, in 1981 Chancellor of the Exchequer  - 7 - clarity on the reaction function and of having longterm interest rates incorporate accurate expectations of future policy."
 These considerations led to the FOMC’s use of forward guidanc e regarding the short -term interest rate in its postmeeting statements during the mid2000s.
" The MPC, in contrast, for a long time generally preferred to let markets infer likely future rates from the extensive communication it provided about its reaction function.19 Beginning in 2008, with the policy rate at or near its lower bound, regular forward guidance acquired new efficacy.20  Through forward guidance, additional accommodation from short -term interest rate policy could be provided by communicating how long the policy rate was expected to remain at its lower bound."
" In addition, the SEP shows individual FOMC participants’ expectations regarding the policy rate, though it does not identify the individuals in the                                                    Geoffrey Howe observed (Howe, 1981) that it was not the authoriti es’ “practice to forecast  interest  rate movements.”  19 Although it provides a n inflation forecast in the Inflation Report , the MPC does not form an interest  rate forecast in conjunction with that inflation forecast."
" Instead, its current practice is to report a “CPI inflation projection based on market interest rate expectations” (Bank of England, 2017b, c hart 5.1)."
" The fact that the MPC ’s Inflation Report  forecast s (for real output  growth, inflation, and the unemployment rate ) condition on market expec tations of interest rates is one difference between the MPC forecasts and the FOMC participants’ projections that are summarized in the SEP."
" Another difference is that the SEP consolidates information on the projections constructed and submitted separatel y by the individual FOMC participants, while the Inflation Report ’s economic projections are arrived at collectively by the MPC  and are therefore the forecasts of the committee as a whole."
 - 8 - interest rate dot plot.
" In the United Kingdom, the MPC started providing forward guidance in its postmeeting statements in 2013.21 As the policy rate --Bank Rate --is still at its lower bound  in the United Kingdom, it remains to be seen whether MP C forward guidance will continue during policy firming."
" In the early post -World War II decades, both U.K. and U.S. authorities sporadically attempted to influence longterm interest rates directly by transacting in longer -term Treasury securities."
" By 1997, however, monetary policy operations in longer -term securities markets had fallen into disuse.22  The financial crisis changed matters, with both countries’ central banks expanding their balance sheets through large -scale purchases of longer -dated securities to put downward pressure on longer -term interest rates and set in motion movements in asset prices and borrowing costs that would stimulate spending by households and businesses."
" 22 Federal Reserve operations  for monetary policy purposes in longer -term securities markets had largely been absent since the Operation Twist experiment of the early 1960s (see, for example, Meltzer (2009, pp."
" In the United Kingdom, operations in longer -term securities markets had continued to figure importantly in monetary policy until the mid -1980s, reflecting attempts by the authorities to influence the term structure of interest rates or to control the stock of money or the volume of liquidity (see Fischer (1987), Goodhart (1999), and Batini and Nelson (2005))."
"  - 9 - policy once interest rates normalize.23  The FOMC has indicated its preference that, barring large adverse shocks to the economy, adjustments to the  federal funds rate will be the main means of altering the stance of monetary policy.24 Changing Perspe ctives on the Lender of L ast Resort  The financial crisis and recession confirmed the value of central bank tools that affect the financial system, beyond those most associated with monetary policy."
" The lender of last resort is also a less impersonal , and more allo cative, device th an aggregate monetary policy tools, because it involves direct lending by the central bank instead of an attempt by monetary policy to alter the overall cost of private -sector borrowing."
" For these reasons, the lender -oflast-resort functi on is bound to be more rule driven than interest rate policy, and it is inevitably associated with collateral arrangements and other safeguards to protect against losses and with strict eligibility criteria."
" The Federal Reserve, which always had regulatory powers, received enhanced authority and devoted more resources to financial  stability.29  In both countries, it remains the case that not all financial stability responsibilities rest with the central bank --so it is less independent in this area than in monetary policy proper --and that the central bank’s tools for achieving financ ial stability are still being refined."
" Second, aggregate monetary policy  tools  are often blunt weapons  against financial imbalances , so deploying them might produce a conflict between financial stability and short -term economic stabilization ."
" Macroprudential  tools  may be more direct and more appropriate for fostering financial stability.31  Third, financial policy might need less frequent adjustment than monetary policy."
" Perhaps reflecting this judgment, the FPC meets quarterly, which contrasts with the MPC’s eight meetings a year.32  The lower frequency of meetings may also reflect the de sirability of a relatively stable regulatory structure; financial tools likely should not be as continuously data dependent  as monetary policy tools."
"  But the case for monetary policy independence set out in the 1990s remains sound, and Bank of England monetary policy independence is now widely accepted in the United Kingdom, as it long has been in the United States."
" It is also clear that central bank responsibilities  other than policy rate decisions --specifically, the lender -oflast-resort function and financial stability --are closely connected with monetary policy  and that these responsibilities play a prominent role  in macroeconomic stabilization ."
