"Stein  Member  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System  at the  National Bureau of Economic Research Conference:   Lessons from the Financial Crisis for Monetary Policy  Boston     October 18, 2013   Thank you."
" The first sch ool is generally suspicious of any kind of time -varying lean, be it with macroprudential tools  such as time -varying , countercyclical capital buffers or margin requirements , or with monetary policy."
" It also points to the politicaleconomy and regulatory -arbitrage impediments that can frustrate the implementation of discretionary time -varying regulation.2  The second school is more comfortable with the idea of t imevarying leans, but invokes what amounts to a separation principle: It takes the view that any financial -stability -motivated leans should come largely, if not entirely, from time -variation in the application of regulatory and supervisory tools, while monetary policy should stick to its traditional dual -mandate objectives of fostering full employment and maintaining price stability."
"Tarullo (2013) , “Macroprudential Regulation,” speech delivered at the Yale Law School Conference on Challenges in Global Financial Services, New Haven, Conn., September 20,  www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/tarullo20130920a.htm    - 3 - across a range of markets, this school of thought is more open to working on multiple fronts  and to formulat ing monetary policy with one eye on its potential implications for these imbalances.4    The debate between these three schools gets a lot of attention at venues like this one—and with good reason."
 Many                                                  4 To be clear: Taking account of financial -stability considerations when formulating monetary policy can be fully consistent with the dualmandate objectives of fostering full employment and price stability.
  Consider a traditional setting where the policymaker has a quadratic loss function over deviations of unemployment and inflation from their target levels.
" Suppose further that high financial -sector leverage or very buoyant credit co nditions today increase the probability of a sharp upward spike in credit spreads at some later date, and the latter prospect in turn raises the conditional variance of economic activity."
" Then the policymaker’s risk aversion over unemployment outcomes may make her willing to try to tighten credit conditions, even at the cost of some employment today, so as to reduce the variance of future employment."
