"  My first real -world involvement in economic policy began late in 1983, when I was invited by Secretary of State George Shultz to join a small team to advise him on the stabilization of the Israeli economy, then suffering from triple -digit inflation and other ills."
" A second Herbism is extremely useful when discussing economic growth or interest rates:  “The difference between a growth rate of 1 percent and a growth rate of 2 percent is 100 percent.”  I have many more but                                                  1 The views expressed here are my own and not necessarily those of others at the Board, on the Federal Open Market Committee, or in the Federal Reserve System."
" I replied with an excellent exposition of monetary and fiscal policies, the accelerating inflation rate, all of the mistakes that were being made, who was doing what to whom, and more."
" The world of central banking was very different then --a fact brought home by recalling that, in th e early 1990s, the interest rate in the United Kingdom was still set by the Treasury and not the Bank of England."
"   - 3 - I gave a speech on monetary policy independence and modern central banking at the tercentenary celebration , in which I made the case for central bank independence and concluded wi th the sentence “On her 300th birthday, it is time to allow the Old Lady to take on the responsibilities of independence.”2  At that time, visitors to Britain who raised the issue of independence for the Bank of England were typically treated to a lecture on why that was not possible in the British political system."
" Nonetheless, independence was granted to the Bank of England by a newly elected Labour government in 1997, and subsequent researchers have linked this independence to declines in both longer -term inflation risk premiums  and inflation expectations.3   The literature I discussed in my 1994 speech was developed with an emphasis --based on post -World War II experience-- on the problem of preventing high inflation."
" The inflation problem with which most of the leading economies are dealing is inflation that is too low, not too high."
" Further, now that we have had time to understand better the damage that the global financial crisis has wreaked on the world economy, and after much research on the effect of major financial crises on growth and on the dynamics of business cycles, we are focused to a much greater extent than in the past on the importance of financial stability."
" I shall argue that, al though high inflation is not the immediate concern that it was in the 198 0s and 1990s , monetary policy independence                                                  2 The lecture, titled “Modern Central Banking,” was printed in the conference volume, Capie and others (1994)."
"  - 4 - remains of the highest importance , and that it is important that we  preserve monetary policy independence to help foster desirable macroeconomic outcomes and financial stability."
"  The Case for Monetary Policy Ind ependence   By 1994, both theory and evidence suggested that more independent central banks deliver better outcomes , particularly lower and more stable inflation."
 Th e theoretical case for monetary policy independence focused on countering inflationary bias es that were likely to exert themselves in the absence of an independent central bank.
" Even in the absence of political interference, inflationary bias c an result from the problem of dynamic inconsistency if central banks cannot credibly commit to keeping inflation low.4   On the empirical side, many s cholars have studied whether monetary policy independence fosters low and stable  inflation in practice."
" Summarizing roughly 25 years of research in his 2008 paper, Alex Cukierman observed that “the evidence is consistent with the conclusion that inflation  and actual [independence] are negatively related in both developed and developing countries.”5  Further, monetary policy independence does not appear to be associated with adverse economic consequences."
" In particular, to the extent that independence of t he central bank  helps restrain inflation, it does not appear to result in significantly more volatile output, as some theoretical models had predicted.6                                                   4 These theoretical results are demonstrated in the seminal work of Kydland and Prescott (1977) and Barro and Gordon (1983)."
"   - 5 - Cukierman goes on to note, however, that the causality from independence to lower inflation is not cle ar, and several studies over the p ast 10 to 15 years have found conflicting results on that front.7    Let me touch on four issues that are now an essential part of the understanding of central bank independence, but that were less prominent in the 1990s."
" First,  there is a distinction between the term s monetary policy independence  and central bank independence ."
" In the literature that developed before the global f inancial c risis, central bank independence referred to independence  from political influences in the setting of monetary policy ."
" But many c entral banks have roles outside monetary policy --in particular, bank regulation and supervision."
" The purposes may be ge neral, such as preserving the value of the currency, maintaining the stability of the financial system, and, in some countries, promoting economic growth or employment."
" These purposes have typically to be translated into operational goals --for instance, m aintaining an inflation rate of 2 percent."
     The academic literature was developed during the early 1990s when the Federal Reserve had already been given its statutory mandate of maximum employment and price stability.
" After careful deliberation, the Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) clarified th at inflation of 2 percent is most consistent with the goal of price stability."
" Virtually every central bank has the authority to engage in asset market transactions, with the goal of setting a specific-- typically short -term--interest rate or, closely related, of controlling the money supply."
" Third, the pow er to set the short -term interest rate or the money supply is a formidable one."
" In almost all countries, the central bank’s accountability is enforced by requiring regular reporting on monetary policy actions and outcomes to the legis lature, to the executive branch, and to the public."
" The argument is often put as “You need as many instruments of policy as you have policy goals,” a result often attributed to Jan Tinbergen, co -winner of the first Nobel Prize in economics.9  Tinbergen’s result is correct if the targets have to be achieved exactly, but it is not correct if there are tradeoffs among the goals of policy, and the  central bank utility or loss function includes the costs of missing each of the targets and the interactions among them.10   Based on the Tinbergen result, central banks whose mandated goals are narrow, such as having only an inflation target, are often considered to have more independence than central banks with additional targets or with multifaceted objectives."
" In practice, I doubt that any central bank targets inflation to the exclusion of all other outcomes."
" For example, the Bundesbank was generally thought to have a very strict focus on inflation in the years in which it had an independent monetary policy before the founding of the European Central Bank."
"  - 8 - that period have concluded that it  likely responded to deviations from target of both expected inflation and output growth.11  I do not regard the Fed’s dual mandate, which gives it both an inflation and an employment goal, as causing significant difficulties for Fed decisionmakers, and not e that if the Fed had only an inflation target and found itself in the situation we find ourselves today, it would face precisely the same difficulty we currently face --how to get the inflation rate up to meet the inflation target."
" The Fed Today  The Feder al Reserve System’s current mandate of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long -term interest rates was established by an amendment to the Federal Reserve Act in 1977."
" The Congress , in effect, recognized the principle of instrument independenc e by requiring that the Federal Reserve Board report semiannually directly to the Congress about the Board’s and the FOMC’s plans to meet these objectives and by exempting monetary policy from Government Accountability Office (GAO) review as part of the Fu ll Employment and Balanced Growth Act of 1978."
" A key venue for reviewing the Fed’s approach to pursuing its mandated goals remains the semiannual  testimony of the Chair, along with the associated Monetary Policy Report."
" 12 Not only do the principles of democracy demand such accountability, but economi c theory also points to accountability as one way of addressing an inflationary bias that might otherwise take hold."
" Transparency can also make monetary policy more ef fective by helping to guide the public’s expectations  and clarify the Committee’s policy intentions.15                                                  13 Prior to 1999, the  FOMC released statements only after meetings at which  the federal funds rate wa s changed."
" 14 There are a number of additional transparency improvements that are less directly related to monetary policy communication, including detailed reports on liquidity facility and lending programs during the financial crisis, which can be found on the Board’ s website at www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/bst_reports.htm ."
" Central Bank Independence and New Challenges  Low inflation  The basic governance structure set up in the late 1970s was envisioned as a means to monitor and encourage the Federal  Reserve to pursue its mandates, and an aggressive and successful campaign to bring down inflation followed."
" Indeed, the high inflation of the 1970s and early 1980s was one of the primary motivations for the broadening and deepening of monetary policy independence worldwide."
  Today c onsumer price inflation remains below  the F OMC’ s objective of 2 percent.
"   - 11 - meeting, participants saw inflation as  very low this year but expected it to pick up notably next year and rise further in 2017.16   Although the presence of low inflation makes the traditional inflationary bias less of an immediate concern, actions that would compromise monetary policy independence would still be dangerous."
 The anchoring of inflation expectations has been a hardfought product of the disinflation of the 1980s and subsequent Federal Reserve policy.
" Today, even with low inflation, t he balance of evidence suggests that survey -based measures of longerterm inflation expectations have likely remained fairly steady and consistent with our objective ."
" The  ancho ring of these expectations is due  in great  part, I suspect,  to the continued credibility of the Fed’s independence from political interference, along with the adoption of the explicit inflation target of 2 percent."
" To put this point clearly, the concern over the effects of political interference in monetary policy remains as valid in practice when inflation is too low as when inflation is too high."
 That is primarily because political horizons are typically shorter than those that need to be taken into acco unt in making monetary policy decisions.
"  Recently, there have been proposals to restrict monetary policy independence."
" One proposal, label ed “Audit the Fed ,” would subject the Federal Reserve’s conduct of monetary policy to unlimited congressional polic y audits.17  (Financial audits are al ready conducted regularly.)18                                                  16 See the Summary of Economic Projections submitted in conjunction wit h the September 2015 FOMC meeting, an addendum to Board of Governors (2015)."
"   - 12 - Another proposal  would require the F OMC  to adopt and follow a specific equation in setting monetary policy and to face immediate congressional hearings and investigation by the GAO whenever the FOMC  deviates from the policy dictated by that equation.19  In the terminology I have used in this speech, these proposals could accurately be described more as restrictions on the Federal Reserve’s instrument independence than as measures that would increase transparency or accountability."
" Since the Federal Reserve is already very transparent abou t its monetary policy decisions, review by the GAO would not meaningfully augment communications with the public but would instead reflect an effort by the Congress to influence the Fed’s  policy decisions."
"  We should recognize that if a GAO review and, li kely, a congressional hearing were held every time a monetary policy decision deviated from a simple equation, as has been proposed, the Fed would be subjected to the very sort of political pressure from which experience suggests central banks should be independent."
 Financial stability  The research on monetary policy independence at the end of the 20th century was conducted on the assumption that the central bank was focused on its direct macroeconomic mandates such as inflation and employment.
" In answering this question, we need to consider an important difference between the use of traditional monetary policy and the use of macroprudential policies."
"  In the face of an incipient bubble growing in the housing sector at a time when inflation and unemployment are at thei r target levels, the first instinct of regulators and others --the central bank among them --is to turn to macroprudential instruments, such as constraints on the loanto-value ratio or the debt -service -toincome ratio of borrowers."
"  This representation can be done as in the British case by having a separate committee to make financial stab ility decisions, the Financial Policy Committee (FPC), located in the Bank of England, whose membership is different from that of the Monetary Policy Committee and on which also sits a nonvoting member from the U.K. Treasury.25  In the U.S. case, the Financial Stability Oversight Council is a coordinating committee, with all of the principal regulators as members and the Secretary of the Treasury as chairman."
"  I have heard foreign central bankers argue, “You can’t be independent in one function (monetary policy) and not independent in another (financial stabilit y), without the nonindependence with respect to financial stability seeping over to weaken the independence of monetary policy.”  I do not believe this is correct --as proof, I think each of us feels and is more independent in some of the decisions we make about our lives than in others."
" Thus, I think the Fed retains its monetary policy independence despite its nonindependence with respect to financial stability policy."
"  - 17 - between --there will be far more experience on which to base the choice of regulatory system, and changes will quite likely be made.28 Finally, as I mentioned at t he Federal Reserve Bank of Boston last month, as a result of the currently limited nature of the macroprudential toolkit, there could be times when adjustments in monetary policy itself should be discussed as a means to curb emerging risks to financial sta bility."
" Alternatively , financial stability considerations can sometimes point to the need for accommodative monetary policy."
" For example, the accommodative U.S. monetary policy since 2008 has helped repair the balance sheets of households, nonfinancial f irms, and the financial sector."
  The challenge to monetary policy independence then derives from the use of a single tool to achieve multiple outcomes across different time horizons.
" I do not regard this challenge as a serious constraint on monetary polic y independence, but rather as an inherent aspect of the fact that monetary policy works in the first instance through financial markets and financial institutions."
   The multifaceted nature of macroprudential policy and its interactions with the governanc e of monetary policy have important consequences that are not yet fully understood.
" The interaction between financial stability and monetary policy, its implications for central bank independence, and the resulting effects on macroeconomic outcomes deserv e extensive study that is already well under way but probably still in its infancy."
  - 18 - Conclusion  The economic environment has changed considerably in the quarter -century since economists began the careful study of the theory and evidence on the potential benefits of monetary policy independence.
