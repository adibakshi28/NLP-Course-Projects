" Most notably, the Federal Reserve’s stress testing policy statement—which governs how the hypothe tical scenarios are determined —requires that the severely adverse scenario include a rapid increase in the unemployment rate to at least 10 percent, as well as steep declines in house prices."
 Such conditions are historically associated with subdued inflation  and a fall in interest rates.
" For example, instead of the usual demanddriven recession, a scenario could explore the impact of an inflationary shock to supply."
"16 The global market shock is specified by a large set of risk factors that include, but are not limited to: equity prices , foreign exchange rates, selected -maturity government yields , selected maturities and  - 8 -  would help us understand how the trading books and counterparty concentrations of firms would change under a range of financial conditions."
" As compared to the global market shock, the exploratory market shock was characterized by a less severe recession with greater inflationary pressures ."
" This is valuable information to us and the public, since  it suggests that these banks’ trading and counterparty exposures may  not be an unexpected source of vulnerability during a rising inflation scenario (although that test did not explore the effects of unrealized losses from interest rate risk)."
