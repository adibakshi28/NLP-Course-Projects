"For release on delivery1:15 p.m. EST (10:15 a.m. PST)January 3, 2016Monetary Policy, Financial Stability, and the Zero Lower BoundRemarks byStanley FischerVice ChairmanBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve Systemat theAnnual Meeting of the Amer ican Economic AssociationSan Francisco, CaliforniaJanuary 3, 2016Thank you."
" The list of challenges we face is long and includes fundamental issues such as lenderof-lastresort policies in the modern financial system, the role of central banks in the supervision of the financial sector, and the appropriate role of forward guidance in monetary policy communications."
" Those are the topics I will not discuss today.Rather, I will focus primarily on three related issues associated with the zero lower bound (ZLB) on nominal interest rates a nd the nexus between monetary policy and financial stability: first, whether we are moving toward a permanently lower longrun equilibrium real interest rate; second, what steps can be taken to mitigate the constraints imposed by the ZLB on the shortterm interest  rate; and, third, whether and how central banks should incorporate financial stability c onsiderations in the conduct of monetary policy.1Are We Moving Toward a World Wi th a Permanently Lower LongRun Equilibrium Real Interest Rate?We start with a key question of the day: Are we moving toward a world with a permanently lower longrun equilibrium real inte rest rate?"
 The equilibrium real interest rate--more conveniently known as r*--is the le vel of the shortterm real rate that is consistent with full utilization of resources.
"My comments today reflect my own views and are not an official position of the Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee.-2rate that would prevail in the longrun once all of the shocks affecting the economy die down.2In terms of the Federal Reserve’s approach to monetary policy, it is the real interest rate at which the ec onomy would settle at full employ ment and with inflation at 2 percent--provided the economy is not at the ZLB."
An international perspective on mediumto-longrun real interest rates is provided by U.S. Executive Office of the President (2015).
" Fundamentally, th e balance of saving and investment demands does so."
 One apriori likely factor is persistent weakness in aggregate demand.
"The slowdown of productivity growth, which has been a prominent and deeply concerning feature of the past four years, is another factor reducing r*.6Others have pointed to demographic trends resulting in th ere being a larger share of the population in age cohorts with high saving rates.7Some have also pointed to high saving rates in many emerging market countries, coupled with a lack of suitable domestic investment opportunities in those countries, as putting dow nward pressure on rates in advanced economies--the global savings glut hypothesis advanced by Ben Bernanke and others at the Fed about a decade ago.8Whatever the cause, other things being equal, a lower level of the longrun equilibrium real rate suggests that the frequency and duration of future episodes in which monetary policy is constrained by the ZLB will be higher than in the past."
" Prior to the crisis, some research suggested that such ep isodes were likely to be relatively infrequent 6It is also a major factor explaining the phenomenon of the economy’s impressive performance on the jobs front during a period of historically slow growth.7See, for instance, Gordon (2014, forthcoming).8See Bernanke (2005)."
" Moreover, the experience of the past seve ral years in the United States and many other countries has taught us that conductin g monetary policy effectively at the ZLB is challenging, to say the least.10And while unconventional policy tools such as forward guidance and asset purchases have been extremely helpful, there are many uncertainties associated with the use of such tools.11I would note in passing that one pos sible concern about  our unconventional policies has eased recently, as the Federal Re serve’s normalization tools proved effective in raising the federal funds rate following our December meeting."
" Many of the factors that determine r*, pa rticularly productivity growth, are extremely difficult to forecast."
" 9See, for instance, Reifschneider and Williams (2000), Blanchard and Simon (2001), and Stock and Watson (2003).10For a discussion of various issues reviewed by the Federal Open Market Committee in late 2008 and 2009 regarding the complications of unconventional monetary policy at the ZLB, see the set of staff memos on the Board’s website at www.federalreserve.gov/foia/fomc/readingrooms.htm .11See Williams (2013).-5What Steps Can Be Taken to Mitigate th e Constraints Associated with the ZLB?Against that backdrop, a second key questi on for central banks is, What steps, if any, can be taken to mitigate the constraints associated with the ZLB?"
" xRaising the Inflation Target : One step that has been proposed by many, including Olivier Blanchard, is the possibility of raising the target rate of inflation from 2 percent to some higher level."
 One concer n I have raised in the past about such proposals is that high levels of inflati on may also be associated with higher inflation variability.
The welfare costs of high and variable inflation could be substantial.
" For example, more variable  inflation would make longrun planning more difficult for households and businesse s."
" And higher and more variable inflation would likely also lead to higher  levels of indexation in the economy over time that, in turn, would make it more difficult for central banks to achieve their inflation goals."
 xNegative Interest Rates :  Another possible step woul d be to reduce shortterm interest rates below zero if needed to provide additional accommodation.
" Our colleagues in Europe are busy rewriting economics textbooks on this topic as we speak--and also helping us to remember earlier discussions of negative interest rates by Keynes, Irving Fisher, Hicks, and Gesell.12To provide further monetary accommodati on amid weak inflation prospects, the European Central Bank lowere d its deposit rate into negative territory in June 12The Europeans have long been intrigued by the possibility of negative rates, beginning with Gesell’s stamp scrip proposal in 1906 and some apparently successf ul experiments with stamp scrip in Austria in the 1930s."
" In addition, the rate cuts into negative territory have acted as expected through the exchange rate channel."
" It is unclear how low policy rates can go before  cash holdings rise or other problems intensify, but the European experience ha s certainly shown that zero is not the effective lower bound in those countries.Could negative interest rates be a policy response that the Federal Reserve could choose to employ in a future crisis?"
 Another concern is whether the complex and interconnected infrastructure supporting securities transactions in the U.S. financial system could readily adap t to a world of negative interest rates.
" And we should not forgetthat additional effective investment in e ducation also adds to the nation’s capital.As another example, numerous studies of  the effects of the Federal Reserve’s asset purchases suggest that these operati ons have reduced the level of the term premium embedded in longterm interest rates."
" If aggregate demand depends primarily on the level of longterm interest rates, it might be possible, in principle, to maintain a level of longterm rates consistent with full employment and stable prices by lowering term premiums while at the same time raising the level of -8short-term rates by a compensating amount ."
" This result could be accomplished, for example, if the Treasury took step s to shorten the average maturity of Treasury debt outstanding or, alternatively, if the Federal Reserve maintained large holdings of longterm assets.xEliminating the ZLB Associated with Physical Currency :  While the European experience suggests that interest rates can be pushed somewhat below zero, the existence of physical currency likely still limits how deeply interest rates can be pushed into negative territory."
" Indeed, the Scandinavian countries have embraced the development of new pa yments technologies that seem to be reducing the need for physical currency  for transactions in those countries.13Nonetheless, a transition to a cashless economy in the United States seems very far off; indeed, U.S. currency outstanding  has been increasing relative to nominal gross domestic product over recent decades, driven importantly by foreign demands for U.S. bank notes."
" Moreover, to eliminate the ZLB associated with physical currency by going cashless, c ountries would need to transition to an economy that did not require widespread use of physical currency, and central banks in those countries would need to  cease issuing physical currency on demand (for example, in response to de mands spurred by negative rates on so13See Alderman (2015).-9called inside money).14For all of these reasons, as a practical matter at least for the United States, it seems highly unlikely that the constraints associated with the ZLB could be meaningfully addressed by steps to encourage a transition to a cashless economy.None of these options for dealing with the difficulties of the ZLB suggest that it will be easy either to raise the equilibrium real rate or to mitigate the constraints associated with the ZLB."
" And, of cour se, such issues are clearly worthy of additional research.How Should Central Banks Incorporate Financial Stability Considerations in the Conduct of Monetary Policy?The challenges associated with the ZLB and the potential risks resulting from an environment of extremely low rates for a prolonged period of time bring me to the third question: How should central banks incorporate financial stability considerations in the conduct of monetary policy?"
" Or, put anothe r way, can we conduct monetary policy in a way that reduces the likelihood of financial instability?15The first response of policymakers to the question of whether monetary policy--defined as the shortterm polic y interest rate--should be used  to support financial stability is to say that macroprudential tools, rather than adjustments in shortterm interest rates,should be the first line of defense.14As an alternative to eliminating currency, a number of authors--including Goodfriend (2000), Buiter (2003), Agarwal and Kimball (2015), McAndrews (2015), and Rogoff (2014)--have discussed various mechanisms that could effectively implement a Gesell tax on physical currency.15See International Monetary Fund (2015) for a broad discussion of many issues in this area.-1 0Macroprudential tools are primarily regulatory or supervisory in nature and target specific activities, markets, and financial institutions."
" Second, in such instances, one could consider using monetary policy--the short term policy interest rate--to lean against the wind of financial stability risks.18The use of monetary policy to address financial stability concerns raises two distinct but closely related sets of questions ."
" The first is whether adjustments in the policy rate can indeed enhance financial stability by reducing either the odds of a financial crisis or the severity of such a crisis once it is under way--and, if so, through which channels.19Provided that the first question is answered  in the affirmative, the second question is how leaning against the wind interacts with the traditional objectives of monetary policy--namely, the employment and inflation mandates in the United States."
" This tradeoff could be small or even nonexistent when both traditional macro objectives and 18See, for instance, Stein (2013) and Carlson and others (forthcoming) for a discussion on the possible use of monetary policy tools to foster financial stability objectives.19Implicit in this discussion is some degree of confidence that the central bank could identify a buildup of financial stability risks."
" Adrian, Covitz, and Liang (2014) offer some views on effective financial stability monitoring.-1 2financial stability objectives call for the same policy action--for example, when the credit cycle is approaching its peak, output is above potential, and inflation pressures appear to be building."
" In contrast, when different objectives call for different policy actions--for example, when some financial assets appe ar overvalued but economic growth remains tepid and inflation is subdued--policymakers may find this tradeoff much more difficult to assess and will search for macroprudentia l tools."
" Perhaps unsurprisingly, recent contributions in the literature that quantify this tradeoff point to a range of recommendations, with some reporting an optimal monetary policy that leans against the wind and some suggesting otherwise.20I would like to conclude on this issue by saying that the issue is a bit more complicated than suggested so far--for, given th at financial variables are a critical part of the transmission mechanism of monetary policy, when policymakers say the economy is overheating, they may well be considering the beha vior of asset prices as a critical part of that phenomenon and part of the reason to tigh ten monetary policy."
" Thus, I believe that the real issue of whether adjustments in in terest rates should be used to deal with problems of potential financial instability is macroeconomic, and that if asset prices across the economy--that is, taking all financia l markets into account--are thought to be excessively high, raising the interest rate ma y be the appropriate st ep."
" Along with other monetary policy issues, particularly the role of the lender of last resort in a world of significant uncertainty, they deserve the a ttention the profession in both academic andgovernmental institutions is, will be, and should be giving them."
