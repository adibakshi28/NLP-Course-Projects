"    Remarks by   Christopher Waller   Member     Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at the  Reykjavik Economic Conference    Reykjavik, Iceland         May 24, 2024   Thank you for t he invitation  to be here and speak to you today.1   I want to step away from shorter -term questions about the economic outlook and monetary policy to delve into a subject of longer -term significance —r*."
" While there are many concepts of r*, I interpret it to be the real policy interest rate that  is neither stimulating nor restricting economic activity  with inflation anchored at the central bank’s inflation target."
" R ecently, for example, discussions  have focused on whether or not r* has risen, which has important implications for the conduct of monetary policy."
" For the purposes of this discussion, I am going to be talking about the longrun, real v alue of r*, when inflation and employment have reached the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) goals."
" Because of that, an estimate of r* points toward where monetary policy is headed over the longer  run."
" But r*  is not a precise number, unlike the unemployment rate, which can be measured directly."
" Though hard to precisely measure, having some understanding of the current level of r* is a matter of obvious importance for monetary policy, so I will focus today on factors that have contributed to the apparent decline in r*  over the past several decades  and look at how they may influence its value going forward."
" - 3 - To get some indication of how r*  has evolved over time, it is helpful to look at the real, or inflation -adjusted , yield of the 10year Treasury security, the most widely held safe and liquid asset."
"  Think of r* as the level of the real federal funds rate once all the cyclical ups and downs of the economy have been factored out, including near -term policy tightening or loosening that sometimes is necessary to move employment and inflation back to the FOMC’s goals."
 One is a series starting in the 1980s using the nominal 10year Treasury yield and subtracting out the Michigan survey’s view of expected inflation over the next 5 to 10 year s (the solid black line) .
" The second measure is a market -based measure, Treasury InflationProtected Securities, or TIPS , which started trading in the late 1990s  (the red dashed line) ."
  I want to pause here and show another measure of longerterm interest rates that some people use to gauge the value of r*—the real return on capital.
" In my view, t his is not the appropriate interest rate to use for discussing r* because it includes some measure of riskiness of business activity and is not directly related to the stance of monetary policy."
" Many researchers have documented the decline in government yields around the world, so I will 5 See, for example, Ricardo  Reis (2023), “ The Future L ongRun L evel o f Interest R ates,” presentation a t the SUERF Conference, Vienna , Austria, December , https://www.suerf.org/wp -content/uplo ads/2023/09/l_c5ab0bc60ac792 9182aadd 08703f1ec6_47133_suerf.pdf ; and Emmanuel Farhi and Francois Go urio (2018) , “Accountin g for Macro -Financ e Trends :  Market P ower, I ntangibles, a nd Risk Premia,” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity,  Fall, 147–2 23, https://www.brookin gs.edu/wpc ontent/uploads/2018/09/FarhiG ourio_finald raft.pd f."
"Let me start by discussing what is not  responsible for this difference in yields .7  First, it cannot be caused by longerrun trends in productivity."
 Trend productivity affects the real return on capital first and foremost.
" So even if trend productivity growth was falling over time, both rates of return would have fallen."
 So falling productivity growth cannot be an explanation.
"Second, this difference in yields cannot be the result of declining population growth."
 It is obvious that what makes U.S. government debt different from the real return on capital and other interest rates  is its safety and global liquidity.

"  - 6 - have  influenc ed the supply and demand for safe, liquid assets ."
" I will try to make the case that the demand for safe, liquid assets outgrew the supply over the past 40 years, which drove a secular increase in the price of U.S. Treasur y securit ies and , thus , a secular decline in their real yield."
"To be clear, I am not focusing on day -today move ments  in interest rates from idiosyncratic events that will ultimately unwind."
" Instead, I am thinking about factors that have longterm consequences for short -term market interest rates and, hence, r* ."
inflation.
" Second, the Great Moderation during this period meant economic performance in the U nited States was less volatile , which meant less variability in the monetary policy rate ."
 This lowered the interest rate risk from holding Treasuries.
" As a result, the opportunity to hold a default -free asset with less risk of inflation and economic volatility made U.S. Treasuries more attractive."
 I interpret this to mean that the inflation risk and real risk of holding Treasur y securit ies made them safer to hold as time went on.
"Now let me turn to five  factors that I believe played a role in causing the demand for safe , liquid assets to grow faster than the supply of these assets , pushing down Treasury  yields and r*."
" Some of these factors are contributing to the downward trend in U.S. longer -term rates, while others affect global longer -term interest rates more broadly."
 This increased the global demand for safe liquid assets  to investors around the world who previously did not have access to U.S. Treasuries.
The second factor causing demand for Treasur y securit ies to grow more than supply was  the large buildup of official reserves that started after the reforms that followed the 1998 financial c risis in Asia .
" The resulting demand for Treasury securities has contributed to pushing down yields and, thus , lowering r*."
" For example, Norway’s sovereign wealth fund holdings of Treasuries grew from $5.6 bill ion to $132.4 bill ion over this period.8  The growth in Treasury holdings by sovereign wealth funds  has clearly contributed to the decline in Treasury yields ."
" The argument here is that as people move past their prime working years, their demand increases for safe, liquid investments that ensure their principal is preserved for their needs in retirement."
" There is evidence that the large number of baby boomers who are retired or planning to do so soon has boosted demand for Treasur y securit ies.9  Outside the United States, population aging is accelerating even faster."
  The fifth  factor that  increased the demand for Treasuries came from  many new financial regulations implemented after the 2008 global financial crisis.
 This rule  has boosted demand for Treasur ies.
" Thus, we saw a significant increase in regulatorydriven demand for safe , liquid U.S. Treasuries  over the past 15 years ."
" On top of this, the Federal Reserve shifted from a limited - to ample -reserves regime to implement monetary policy effectively at the onset of the Global Financial Crisis .11  This regime shift resulted in more Treasury securities permanently held by the Federal Reserve."
 These policy choices have resulted in higher demand from the public and the Federal Reserve and put downward pressure on yields and r* .
" Not likely , although the growth in their demand may slow."
 So the growth in regulatory demand for Treasur y securit ies could slow (not increase) substantially .
" The U.S.  government issues Treasuries to finance deficit spending, which  obviously impact s Treasury supply."
 Deficit spending and the federal debt have been increasing since the  12 See Christopher J.
" I believe the factors increas ing demand that I just reviewed have outstripped the increase in supply over the past few decades, leaving r*  lower ."
" But i f the growth in the supply of U.S. Treasuries begins to outstrip demand, this  will mean lower prices and higher yields, which will put upward pressure on r* ."
"  It is probably not news to many people that the U.S. is on an unsustainable fiscal path.13  The latest outlook from the Congressional Budget Office paints a challenging picture of the future , with debt expected to grow at an unprecedentedly high rate for an economy at full employment and not involved in a major war.14   All of these financing pressures may  contribute to a rise in r*  in coming year s, but only t ime will tell how large a factor the U.S. fiscal position will be in affecting r* ."
     13 Discussion of growing U.S. deficits is not new.
" F or a discussion of the growing deficit at that time , see, for example, Ben S."
