" Japan is an important economic partner of the United States, and our economies are linked through trade in goods and services as well  as capital  flows that affect  interest rates and other aspects of financial  markets."
 I will conclude with so me remarks about the monetary policy decision we announced on Wednesday.
" The current economic expansion, now in its 11 th year, is the longest on record, and the economy continues to advance at a moderate pace, with real gross domestic product (GDP) growth running at 2 percent over the past year and 1.9 percent in the most recent quarter."
" Growth has been                                                  1 These remarks represent my own views, which do not necessarily represent those of the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee."
" The unemployment rate is near a half -century low, real wages are rising, and workers  who had earlier left the labor force are returning to find jobs."
" There is no sign that cost -push pressures are putting excessive  upward force on price inflation, and to me, plausible estimates of the natural rate of unemployment extend from just above 4 percent to the current level."
"  Core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation  over the 12 months ending in September, at 1.7 percent, remains muted, and headline inflation, currently running at 1.3 percent, is likely this year to fall somewhat below our 2 percent objective."
" Price stability, as I see it, requires that inflation expectations  as well as actual inflation be stable and consistent with our 2 percent inflation target."
" We do not directly observe inflation expectations, and I myself consult a wide range of survey and market estimates."
" Based on these estimates, I judge that measures of inflation expectations resi de at the low end of a range I consider consistent with price stability."
 Global growth has been sluggish since the middle of 2018.
 This slowdown in global growth as well as  increased uncertainty about the outlook for global trade policy appear to be headwinds for manufacturing activity and investment spending in the United States and abroad.2  Also another source of uncertainty in the global economy has been and continues to be Brexit.
" T he global growth outlook                                                  2 Caldara and others  find that increased trade policy uncertainty, independent of the actual effect of higher tariffs, can exert a significant negative drag on U.S. and global GDP."
 China is balancing its desire to curtail credit growth and promote delev eraging against its  understandable aspiration to maintain a rapid pace of economic growth in a country of 1.4 billion people.
" Finally, global disinflationary forces remain and present ongoing challenges to many central  banks in their efforts to achieve and maintain price stability."
" In sum, global conditions present  headwinds  for the U.S. outlook, and, as my colleagues and I at the Federal Reserve have emphasized, these headwinds have been a  prominent consideration in our recent monetary policy assessments."
economy.3   Channels and Linkages  Perhaps the most direct l ink betw een economic conditions abroad and in the United States is foreign demand for U.S. exports.
The pace of economic expansion abroad is a key determinant of the demand for U.S. exports .
" Most recently, the I nternational Monetary Fund projects foreign GDP growth in 2019 to have sl owed to its weakest pace since the financial crisis."
"    The pace of economic growth in our major trading partners affects the demand for U.S. exports not only directly, but al so indirectly by influencing t he value of the dollar ."
" When foreign growth weakens and central banks abroad ease monetary policy to support their domestic economies , returns on dollar assets appear relatively more attractive, capital flows into U.S. market s, and these flows will tend to boost the foreign exchange value of the dollar."
" A stronger dollar, for either reason, makes U.S. exports more expensive for foreign buyers, makes U.S. imports from abroad more attractive to U.S. purchasers, and thereby tends to lower demand for U.S ."
" Slow  productivity growth and population aging have lowered potential growth rates in major  foreign economies, decreasing demand for investment and increasing desired saving, both of which have contributed to low er equilibrium interest rates abroad , with spillovers to the rest of the world, including in the United States.4  Global  developments influence not only U.S. economic  activity and fina ncial markets, but also U.S. inflation."
 Global factors —through their influences on U.S. aggregate demand and supply that I just described—can alter U.S. inflation dynamics.
" A n appreciation of  the dollar can                                                  4 See Richard Clarida (2019), “The Global Factor in Neutral Policy Rates:  Some Implications for Exchange Rates, Monetary Policy, and Policy Coordination,” International Finance Discussion Papers 1244 (Washington:  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve S ystem, April), https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/ifdp/files/ifdp1244.pdf ."
"  - 6 - lower the dollar price of U.S. imports , although empirically, this effect is less than onefor-one, as foreign exporters tend to keep the dollar price s of their goods comparatively stable relative to ob served exchange rate fluctuations .5  In addition, swings in global commodity prices influence U.S. inflation."
" Over the past year,  the rise in the dollar and falling oil prices have been important contributors to the subdued pace of U.S. inflation."
" To begin with, Japanese growth, while slower than in the United States, has been running above the pace needed to absorb new entrants to the labor force, and its strong labor market is operating with an unemployment rate near multidecade lows at 2.2 percent."
" Also, as in the United States, weak exports have recently been a drag on Japanese growth."
 One example is the relationship between episodes of global financial stress and the exchange rate .
"Goldberg  (2005),  “Exchange Rate Pass -Through into Import Prices ,” Review of Economics and Statistics , vol."
" One aspect of this, as mentioned earlier, is that changes in the value of the dollar tend to have a relatively limited effect on U.S. import prices and import demand."
" Despite the importance of the yen in global financial markets, a significant portion of Japan’s trade is also invoiced in dollars rat her than yen, including not only Japan’s exports to the United States, but also its exports to other countries in Asia.6  Some scholars have proposed that the importance of the dollar in Japan’s trade lessens the responsiveness of Japan’s exports to moveme nts in the yen while making exports more sensitive to changes in the value of the dollar and, therefore , U.S. monetary conditions.7   Regarding inflation, through the considerable efforts of the Bank of Japan’s quantitative and qualitative monetary easing program launched in early 2013, Japan has emerged from almost 15 years of modest deflation and is now operating with a positive inflation rate."
" While the inflation remains below the Bank of Japan’s longrun objective of 2 percent, it represents a notable accomplishment given the difficulty of changing public inflation expectations after a long period of modest deflation in consumer prices."
"  - 8 - Conclusion Returning to the U nited States , I would like to wrap up with a brief discussion of our monetary policy decision this week ."
" The economy is in a good place, and monetary policy is in a good place."
" Since monetary policy operates with a lag, the full effects of these adjustments on economic growth, the job market, and inflation will be realized over time."
"  We see the current stance of monetary policy as likely to remain appropriate as long as incoming information about the economy remains broadly consistent with our outlook of moderate economic growth, a strong labor market, and inflation near our symmetric 2  percent objective."
