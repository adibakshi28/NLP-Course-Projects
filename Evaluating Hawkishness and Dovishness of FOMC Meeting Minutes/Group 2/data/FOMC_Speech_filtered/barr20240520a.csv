" As many of you know, I have two roles at the Federal Reserve—my role as a governor of the Board and member of the Federal Open Market Committee  (FOMC) , where I participate in developing and setting monetary policy, and my role as the Vice Chair for Supervision, where I oversee our supervision and regulation of the banking sector."
"  To start, I will share a couple of observations about the current stance of monetary policy."
 Labor demand is being met with rising supply from both improved labor force participation and immigration.
 We have solid growth and low unemployment.
" The u nemployment rate has been below 4 percent for 27 months, the longest stretch of unemployment that low in more than 50 years."
I am strongly committed to meeting the mandate that Congress has given us to achieve maximum employment and price stability.
" We are doing very well on the employment component of our mandate, and we have also made tremendous progress over the past two years on the inflation component."
 Inflation has fallen from its peak of  1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.
" As noted in the FOMC’s statement following our meeting earlier this month, inflation readings in the first quarter of this year were disappointing."
 These results did not provide me with the increased confidence that I was hoping to find to support easing monetary policy by reducing the federal funds rate .
" In the same way that the public depends on monetary policy to support a healthy economy, the public also depends on a strong and stable financial system, so I would like a spend the remainder of my time discussing the prudential regulatory framework the Fed uses to oversee banks and promote financial stability."
" SVB was a highly vulnerable bank, and its vulnerabilities left the bank exposed to the specific combination of rising interest rates and slowing activity in the technology sector that materialized in 2022 and early 2023."
" This would better reflect  interest rate risk in capital, a problem that played a major role in b oth SVB’s and First Republic’s failures."
