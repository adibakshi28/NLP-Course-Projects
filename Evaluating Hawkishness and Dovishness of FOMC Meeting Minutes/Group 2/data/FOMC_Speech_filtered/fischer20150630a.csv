"For release on delivery  2:00 p.m. EDT (7:00 p.m. local time ) June 30, 2015         Monetary Policy in the United States and in Developing Countries     Remarks by   Stanley Fischer   Vice Chair man  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at the  Crockett Governors’ Roundtable 2015 for African Central Bankers       University of Oxford   Oxford, England         June 30, 2015    I would like to thank the organizers of the conference for inviting me to this event .1  I have been invited in the past and had very much wanted to take part --especially in light of my having been born in Zambia and having received my schooling in Zambia, South Africa, and Zimbabwe --but somehow it never worked out."
" Until the Great Financial Crisis, both the practice and the theory of modern central banking revolved around the inflationary tendencies inhere nt in the conflict between the short - and long -run effects of monetary expansion and in the temptations of monetary financing of government spending .3  Taking into account the fact that many leading central banks have recently had to deal with below -target  inflation , one would have to amend the previous sentence to say that the practice and the theory of modern central banking revolve around the benefits of keeping monetary policy independent of short -term political considerations --with respect to both the stabilization of the price level and the temptations of monetary financing of the budget."
 The mandate given to central banks in legislation passed in th e 1930s and 1940s typically included both monetary stability and the promotion of full employment and maximum output --and frequently other goals as well.
"  - 3 - As the inflationary forces that eventually led to the collapse of the Bretton Woods system gathered strength in the 1960s and 1970s, the focus of monetary policy shifted to the maintenance of the domestic value of the currency."
" In the decades that followed, central banks began to place greater emphasis on the stabilization of inflation, and that trend has continued to date.4 Although this shift in emphasis originated in the advanced economies, emerging market and developing economies eventually followed suit, with many of them bringing down high rates of inflation and formally adopting an inflation targe ting policy framework."
" Even in countries without formal inflation targeting frameworks, stabilization of inflation remains an important objective, sometimes alongside other important objectives such as stabilization of the external value of the currency, stabilization of the macroeconomy, financial stability, and the development of the monetary and financial systems."
" The U.S. Economy and Monetary Policy  In the United States, the Federal Reserve has , since 1977, been operating under a dual mandate to pursue  maximum sustainable employment and price stability.5  Our main challenge, since the global financial crisis, has been to make rapid (or at least as rapid as possible) progress toward achieving these objectives."
" While it has taken a long time, and extraor dinary monetary policy actions, the U.S. economy is now close to full employment, with core inflation, at 1.2 percent, below our 2 percent inflation target, but ,                                                  4 Note that the reference here is to the stabilization of inflation rather than just keeping inflation low."
" 5 While the dual mandate, with equal weight on employment and inflation, is exceptional among leading central banks, I believe that central banks with a legislated or declared sole or primary goal of maintaining price stability in practice rarely, if ever, act  as if the level of employment or economic activity is of little concern."
  Let me provide an update on recent progress toward the attainment of these goals and its effects on the current stance of the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy.
" U.S. economic activity and i nflation  The U.S. economy slowed sharply in the first quarter of this year, with the most recent estimate being that real GDP declined 0.2 percent at an annual rate."
" Confirming that view, the latest monthly data on real consumption provide welcome evidence that consumer demand is rebounding , and that economic ac tivity likely expanded at an annual rate of about 2.5 percent in the second quarter ."
" These gains are lower than those seen late last year but are still substantial, and they are above the rate needed to maintain the rate of unemployment at a constant rate of labor force participation."
 The unemployment rate has moved lower this year and registered 5.5 percen t in May.
 Both long -term unemployment and involuntary part -time employment declined as well.
  - 5 - There are grounds  for optimism that economic growth will be sufficient to promote further gains in labor market conditions.
 Our analysis of the determinants of U.S. trade suggests that the recent appreciation of the dollar will restrain economic growth to some extent for a time even after these transitory factors have dissipated.
"  Evaluating all of the indicators, the FOMC expects --as outlined in its June 17 statement --that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, with labor market indicators continuing to move toward levels consistent with the dual mandate."
"  - 6 - Turning to price stability, the other goal of our dual mandate, we have seen little progress toward inflation moving back to our target of 2 percent."
" The 12 -month change in headline personal consumption expenditures prices is now close to zero --though that very low level of inflation is temporary, in large part reflecting the large declines in energy prices around the turn of 2015."
 The stronger dollar is also weighing on U.S. inflation by reducing the prices we pay for our imported goods and services.
 Core inflation is running at 11/4 percent and will likely remain lower than we would like in the months ahead as the exchange rate effects pass through.
" Over the medium term, the FOMC expects inflation to rise gradually toward 2 percent as the labor market tightens  and the transitory effects of declines in energy and import prices wane; indeed, energy prices appear to have stabilized ."
"U.S. monetary policy  Based on our reading of economic conditions, the FOMC decided at its June 17 meeting to leave the federal funds rate target range at 0  to 1/4 percent."
 The Committee will assess progress --both realized and expected --toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.
" Of course, because monetary policy  affects the economy with a lag, we should not wait until we have reached our objectives to begin adjusting policy."
  We anticipate that  it will be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate when we have seen further improvement in the labor market and are  - 7 - reasonably confident that inflation will move back to 2 percent over the medium term.
"  Regarding inflation, an important factor working to increas e confidence in the inflation outlook will be continued improvement in the labor market."
 Theoretical and empirical evidence suggests that inflation will eventually begin to rise as resource utilization tightens.
" But that is only a forecast, and monetary policy will , in practice, be determined by the dat a--primarily data on inflation and unemployment."
 We are aware of the possibility that low interest rates maintained for a prolonged period could prompt an excessive buildup in leverage or cause underwriting standards to erode as investors take on risks they cannot measure or manage appropriately in a reach for yield.
" - 8 - U.S. Monetary Policy Spillovers and Global Interest Rates  As we consider the decision of policy rate normalization, we are mindful of possible spillovers to other economies , including emerging market and developing economies."
"  Beyond communicating our intentions, we also emphasize that monetary policy normalizatio n in the United States will occur in the context of a strengthening U.S. economy, which should benefit the emerging market and developing economies."
"Still, one feature of the era after the first increase of the federal funds rate will , in all likelihood , be higher U.S. and global interest rates compared with their extraordinarily low levels of recent years."
" The increase in global interest rates could cause investors to adjust their portfolios, triggering capital outflows from emerging market and developing  economies."
" This development is  - 9 - due to the significant economic progress of the continent of the past several years and to commodity booms, ample global liquidity, and low interest rates."
  Higher global interest rates could limit the possibilities for governments to finance their projects or budgets on the same favorable terms.
 The reduced ability of governments to finance their needs will likely increase the challenges faced by central banks in their efforts to assist the economic growth and development agendas of their national governments.
" For example, s ince the 1990s, many of them have made remarkable progress i n reducing inflation, improving government debt ratios, buil ding foreign reserves, and better regulating and capitalizing their banking systems."
 These improved economic fundamentals should bolster their resilience should normalization of monetary policy in the United States and some other advanced economies lead t o financial market stresses .
" Monetary Policy in Developing Countries  As mentioned earlier, the Federal Reserve has operated under a dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment, which has worked well for the U .S."
" When it comes to central banking  more generally , I doubt that there is any particular monetary policy framework that i s suitable for all countries f or all times."
" The central bank’s choice of monetary policy framework should depend on the objectives it aims to achieve, on the challenges that the economy faces , and on the  structure of the financial  - 10 - markets and the economy in which it operates ."
 And it is likely that the monetary policy framework will change over time as the domestic economy and the international financial system develop.
 The exchange rate regime is a key consideration.
" Over the longer term, this is a welcome development that will help meet the substantial financing needs of the private and public sectors, but greater finan cial integration and financial flows also complicate monetary policy in an environment in which exchange rate considerations are important --and they are generally very important."
" These are small open economies in which external shocks are often large, and  the excessive volatility inherent in free -floating exchange rates can be costly."
Why n ot simply peg the exchange rate?
" According to the impossible triad, or the more sophisticated version developed by Hélène Rey, the impossible duo, a pegged rate, combined with capital mobility, makes it difficult for monetary policy to be used independent ly to achieve macroeconomic stabilization and price stability.6  Nonetheless, some economies have successfully implemented pegged exchange rates."
"  Properly managed, some flexibility of exchange rates  can help economies absorb external shocks, including swings in prices of commodities to which these economies are still heavily exposed."
  - 11 - exchange rate systems among emerging market and dev eloping economies.
" However, none of us should underestimate the difficulties of managing the exchange rate and of developing knowledge about when and how much to allow the exchange rate to move in response to domestic and external economic shocks."
"  Even beyond the management of the exchange rate, central banks in developing countries face difficult challenges in developing their monetary policy frameworks."
" For many years, the standard I nternational M onetary F und approach to monetary policy --which embodie d the monetary approach to the balance of payments --emphasized money targets."
" As you know, the effectiveness of such a framework depends, among other things, on the stabilit y of the money demand function and on the structural relationship between monetary aggregates and macroeconomic variables."
" For this reason, advanced economies abandoned them, and some emerging market economies followed suit, generally, in favor of inflation targeting frameworks, with short -term interest rates as the main instruments and the use of open market operations to control the liquidity in the economy."
 However the conditions necessary for full -blown inflation  targeting achieved through adjustment of policy interest rates may not be present in some of these economies.
"    In the advanced economies and some emerging market economies, financial systems are relatively well developed, deep, and diversified, which facilitates the conduct  - 12 - of monetary policy through open market operations."
" Indeed, in many countries, interbank markets are stil l underdeveloped, and, even though some central banks use policy rates, changes to these policy rates have only limited effect on other interest rates and on the economy more generally."
" Thus, the ambitions of developing countries to modernize their moneta ry policy frameworks have to proceed in parallel with further efforts to develop the market institutions necessary to conduct monetary policy in a conventional way.7    Concluding Remarks  Central banking as a profession has come a long way, striving to ada pt itself to the challenges faced by economies over time, and both the practice and theory of central banking will continue to evolve."
" Nonetheless, significant challenges remain to develop financial systems and accelerate financial inclusion, to enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy, and to further expand the institutional a nd operational capacities of central banks."
"                                                    7 See, for example, Laurens and others (2015)  for a compreh ensive discussion on transitional monetary policy arrangements."
