"For release on delivery  4:00 p.m. EDT  November 4, 2016         The Economic Outlook      Remarks on “Policy Challenges after the Great Recession” by   Stanley Fischer   Vice Chair man  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at  “Macroeconomics after the Great Recession ”  17th Jacques Polak Annual Research Conference, sponsored by  the International Monetary Fund   Washington, D.C.        November 4, 2016    With today’s data in the news , I will first say a few words about labor market conditions before moving on to discuss  the economi c outlook and monetary policy .1  The labor market has , by and large, had a pretty good year."
" Including this morning’s release for October , payrolls have increased an average of 18 1,000 per month this year, a slower pace than last year but enough to keep the unemployment rate flat at about 5 percent."
" The unchanged unemployment rate reflects a positive, though perhaps transitory, devel opment --mainly a pickup in labor force participation."
" The rise in participation may reflect the effects of the modest pickup in wages we are now seeing, with the rate of increase in the employment cost index having risen from an annual rate of about 2 per cent last year to 2 -1/4 percent so far this year."
"     Over the course of the p ast two years , a vari ety of negative shocks have affected the U.S. economy, but employment has resumed robust growth after each temporary slowdown:  T his recovery  has been and continues to be powerful in terms of one of our two main targets --employment --and it is my view that the labor market is close to full employment."
 It is nonetheless interesting to ask  what level  of payroll gains  would maintain an unemployment  rate of roughly 5 percent .
" Unsurprisingly, t he level of payroll  gain s consistent with an unchanged unemployment rate is highly dependent on developments in labor force participation."
" If labor force participation w as to remain flat, job gains in the range of 125,000 to 175,000 would likely be needed to prevent unemployment from creeping up."
" If we assum ed a downward trend in participation of about 0.3 percentage point per year, in line with estimates of the likely drag from demographics, job gains in the range of 65,000 to 115,000 would likely be sufficient to maintain full employment."
  Last week we recei ved some encouraging news on output  growth.
" Household spending growth slowed , and residential investment declined."
" A  surge in exports  supported growth; however, much of the increase was in shipments of soybeans , while exports of other goods remained tepid."
" Growth was also supported by a buildup in inventories, breaking a streak of five quarters in which inventories contributed negatively to growth, the longest such run in more than  50 years."
" Overall, I expect GDP growth to continue at a moderate pace, supported by household spending, renewed business investment, and the waning effects of past dollar appreciation on export growth."
 I will now t urn to inflation.
" H eadline PCE  (personal consumption expenditures) inflation has moved up this year, wit h the 12month change reaching 1.2 percent in September."
" As the transitory effects of the earlier fall in oil prices and rise in the dollar fade, PCE inflation can be expected to rise further toward our 2 percent target, supported by higher core P CE inflation , which ran at a 1.7 percent pace in September."
 They relate in large part to the secular stagnation arguments that were laid out yesterday in Larry S ummers’ Mundell -Fleming lec ture--in particular the behavior of the rate of productivity growth.
" The  statement that the problem w e face is largely one of demand --and we do face that problem --seems to imply either that productivity growth is called forth by aggregate demand, or a Say’s Law of productivity growth, namely that productivity  growth produces its own demand."
" Rather, it will be answered by the behavior of output and inflation as we approach and perhaps to  some extent exceed our employment and inflation targets ."
