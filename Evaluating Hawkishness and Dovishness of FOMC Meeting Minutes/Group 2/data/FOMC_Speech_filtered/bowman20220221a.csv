"E ST  February 21, 2022         High Inflation and the Outlook for Monetary Policy     Remarks by   Michelle W."
"Bowman   Member     Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at  The American Bankers Association  Community Banking Conference         Palm Desert, California            February 21, 2022    Before we get to our conversation  on community banking, I would like to briefly discuss my outlook for the U.S. economy and my view of appropriate monetary policy.1   As I see it, the  main challenge for monetary policy now is to bring inflation down without harming the ongoing economic expansion."
 Inflation is much too high.
 Last year I noted that inflationary pressures associated with strong demand and constrained supply could take longer to subside than many expected.
"  Since then, those problems  have persisted and inflation has broadened, reaching the highest rate that Americans have faced in forty years."
"  High inflation is a heavy burden for all Americans, but especially for those with limited means who are forced to pay more for everyday items , delay purchases, or put off saving for the future."
"  I intend to support prompt and decisive action to lower inflation, and today I will explain how the Fed is pursuing this goal."
" In the near term, I expect that uncomfortably high inflation will persist at least  through the first half of 2022."
" We may see signs of i nflation easing in the second half of the year, but there is a substantial risk that high inflation could persist."
" Employment costs  for businesses, as measured  by average hourly wages , also rose last month ."
 And continued tightness in the labor market indicates that upward pressure on wage s and other  employment  compensation is  not likely to moderate soon.
"  My base case is that inflation will moderate later this year, which will depend , in part, on appropriate actions by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)."
 But with  1 My views on the outlook and monetary policy are my own  and do not necessarily reflect th ose of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee .
"   - 2 -  wage growth lagging behind inflation for the past year , many families may find it challenging to make ends meet  and continued rising home prices  will likely prevent many from entering the housing market."
"  I expect t o see continued strength in the job market this year, with further gains in employment, and my hope is that more Americans return to the labor force and find work."
 Th e strength in job creation  is a big positive  for those seeking employment  and for their families.
" Even with the improving labor market, I still hear from businesses that  qualified workers  are difficult to find , and labor shortages remain a  drag on hiring and on economic growth."
" I n my view, conditions in the labor market have been and are currently consistent with the FOMC’s  goal of maximum employment, and as such, my focus has been on the persistently high inflation."
" In part, the high inflation r eflect s supply chain disruptions associated with the economic effects of the pandemic  and efforts made to contain it ."
" Unfortunately, monetary policy isn’t wellsuited to address supply issues ."
" But strong demand and a very tight labor market  have also contributed to infla tion pressures, and the FOMC can help alleviate those pressures by removing the extraordinary monetary policy accommodation that is no longer needed."
"  In our most recent monetary policy statement— which was released following  our January meeting—we indicat ed that “with inflation well above 2 percent and a strong  - 3 -  labor market,” we expected that it would “soon be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate.”2  I fully supported that assessment, and the data we have seen since then have o nly increased the urgency  to get on with the process of normalizing our interest rate stance and significantly reducing the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet ."
 Returning the balance sheet  to an appropriate and manageable level  will be an important additional step to ward  addressing high inflation .
" I expect  that these steps will contribute to a n easing in inflation pressure s in the coming months , but further steps will likely be needed this year  to tighten monetary policy."
" Looking beyond this spring, my views on the appropriate pace of interest rate increases and balance sheet reduction for this year and beyond will depend on how the economy evolves."
 I will be particularly focused on how much progress we make on bringing do wn inflation.
"   - 4 -  inflation , bring ing it back toward our  2 percent goal, while keeping the economy on track to continue creat ing jobs and economic opportunity for Americans."
  I appreciate the opportun ity to share my views on monetary policy  with you this morning.
