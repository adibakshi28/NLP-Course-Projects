"For release on delivery  12:40 p.m. EDT ( 11:40 a.m.  CDT) May 17, 2024          Brief Remarks on the Economy, Monetary Policy, and Bank Regulation     Remarks by   Michelle W."
" Before  sharing my thoughts about the current bank regulatory environment , I will discuss  my views on the economy and monetary policy ."
"Update on the Economy and Monetary Policy Outlook  Over the past two years, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has significantly tightened the stance of monetary policy to address high inflation."
"After seeing considerable progress on slowing inflation last year, we have not yet seen further progress  this year."
" The 12 -month measures of total and core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation have moved roughly sideways since December and remained elevated at 2.7 percent and 2.8 percent, respectively, in March."
" With  average core consumer price index ( CPI) inflation this year through April running at an annualized rate of 4.3 percent, well above average inflation in the second half of last ye ar, I expect inflation to remain elevated for some time."
" The recent pickup seems to be evident across many goods and services categories, suggesting that inflation was temporarily lower in the latter half of last year."
 Inflation  1  The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.
" - 2 -  has hit lower -income households hardest since food, energy, and housing services price increases far outpaced overall inflation throughout this episode."
 Economic activity increased at a strong pace last year but may have  moderat ed early  this year.
" Firstquarter gross domestic product growth was temporarily dampened by volatile categories, like inventories and net exports, and over the past few months , including recent data revisions, consumers appear to have pulledback on goods spending  through April ."
" So far this year, p ayroll employment has increased at a strong pace through April, partly reflecting increased immigrant labor supply."
" Recent employment reports continue to show a tight labor market, and the unemployment rate remain s below 4 percent , with the number of job openings relative to unemployed workers still above its pre -pandemic level."
" Throughout l ast year, the average pace of job gains slowe d, and the labor force participation rate rose , but i n recent months, job growth has rebounded ."
" At its current setting, our monetary policy stance appears to be restrictive, and I will continue to monitor the incoming data to assess whether monetary policy is sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to our target."
" As I’ve noted recently, my baseline outlook continues to be that inflation will decline further with the policy rate held steady, but I still see a number of upside inflation risks that affect my outlook."
" - 3 -  First, much of the progress on inflation last year was due to supply -side improvements, including easing of supply chain constraints; increases in the number of available workers, due in part to immigration; and lower energy prices."
 It is unclear whether further supply -side improvements will continue to lower inflation.
" Geopolitical developments could also pose upside risks to inflation, including the risk that spillovers from regional conflicts could disrupt global supply chains, putting additional upwar d pressure on food, energy, and commodity prices."
" There is also the risk that the loosening in financial conditions since late last year and additional fiscal stimulus could add momentum to demand, stalling any further progress or even causing inflation t o reaccelerate."
" Finally, there is a risk that strong consumer demand for services, increased immigration, and continued labor market tightness could lead to persistently high core services inflation."
" Wage growth has remained at an elevated rate of about 4 to 5 percent, still higher than the pace consistent with our  2 percent inflation goal given trend productivity growth."
" In light of these risks, and the general uncertainty regarding the economic outlook, I will continue to watch the data closely as I assess the appropriate path of monetary policy."
 It is important to note that monetary policy is not on a preset course.
" While the current stance of monetary policy appears to be at a restrictive level, I remain willing to raise the  target range for the  federal funds rate at a future meeting should the incoming data indicate that progress on inflation has stalled or reversed."
 Restoring price stability is essential for achieving maximum employment over the longer run.
 They may choose to pursue  M&A to remain competitive with larger peers who can achieve that growth organically through their sheer scale.
" There is ample evidence that undermin es this argument, includi ng the resource demands on institutions of pursuing M&A activity , and the protracted time it takes to complete the regulatory review and approval process  (and the not insignificant failure rate we see represented in withdrawn applications) ."
" Reducing the efficiency of bank M&A can be a deterrent to healthy bank transactions —limiting  activity that preserves the presence of community banks in underserved areas , prevent ing institutions from pursuing prudent growth strategies, and undermin ing competition by preventing firms from growing to a larger scale, effectively creating a “protected class” of larger institutions."
" Review of Regulations under the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act  Finally, I ’d like to highlight another opportunity for stakeholders to provide feedback on the agencies’ regulations."
" In February, the Board  announced the initiation of  its review of its regulations to identify those  regulations  that are outdated, unnecessary, or overly burdensome in accordance with the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act  (EGRPRA )."
"  The lessons learned from supervisory failures during the bank stress last spring  clearly illustrate that bank examiners and bank management should focus on core issues, like credit risk, interest rate risk, and liquidity risk."
" We should rightly be concerned about regulatory pressure on a single issue that could lead to the misallocation of risk -management resources  away from risks that may be more material, such as interest rate, liquidity, and cyber risk s."
