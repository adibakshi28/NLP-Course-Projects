"For release on delivery  12:45 p.m. EDT   October 2, 2018 Monetary Policy and Risk Management at a Time of Low Inflation and Low Unemployment Remarks by Jerome H."
Today I will focus on the Federal Reserve’s ongoing effort s to promote maximum employment and stable prices.
" The unemployment rate stands at 3.9 percent, near a 20 -year low."
 Inflation is currently running near the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) objective of 2 percent.
" For example, the medians of the most recent projections from FOMC participants and the  Survey of Professional Forecasters, as well as the most recent Congressional Budget Office (CBO) forecast,  all have the unemployment rate remaining below 4 percent through the end of 2020, with inflation staying very near 2 percent over the same period.1   From the standpoint of our  dual mandate, this is a remarkably positive outlook."
" Indeed, I was asked at last week’s press conference whether these forecasts are too good to be true --a reasonable question!  Since 1950, the U.S. econom y has experienced periods  of low, stable inflation and periods of very low unemployment, but never both for such                                                  1 I am referring to the most recent forecast for year -end 2018 through 2020."
 The unemployment rate for each forecast bottoms out at 3.4 percent or 3.5 percent in 2019 and remains below 4 percent.
 Headline PCE (personal consumption expenditures) inflation is between 1.9 percent and 2.1 percent for all three years and forecasts.
"   - 2 - an extended time as is seen in these forecasts.2  Standard economic thinking has long offered an explanation for this:  If unemployment were to  remain this low for this long, employers would be pushing up wages as they compete for scarce workers, and rising  labor costs would feed into more -rapid price inflation faced by consumers."
"   This dynamic between unemployment and inflation is known as a P hillips curve  relation ship, and at times it can pose a fundamental tension between the two sides of the Fed’s mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability."
" Recent low inflation and unemployment have some analysts asking, “Is the Phillips curv e dead?”3  Others argue that the Phillips curve still lurks  in the background and could reemerge at any time to  exact revenge for low unemployment in the form of high inflation."
 The first is to explain how changes in the Phillips curve help account for the somewhat surprising but broadly shared current forecasts of continued very low unemployment with inflation near 2 percent.
" What is more likely, in my view, is that many factors, including better conduct of monetary policy over the past few decades, have greatly reduced, but not eliminated, the effect s that  tight labor markets  have on inflation."
"  However, no one fully understands the nature of these changes or the role they play in the                                                  2 For example, there have been four periods with quarterly average unemployment below 4 percent since 1950."
" In an early 1950s episode, inflation ranged from below zero to 8 percent."
" Toward the end of the 1950s, unemployment was near 4 percent for a time, dipping to 3.9 percent for one quarter."
" During this low unemployment period, inflation rose steadily from under 1 percent to over 3 percent."
 The remaining two episodes with unemployment under 4 percent --one each in the 1960s and 1990s --are discussed later in the speech.
" Common sense suggests we should beware when forecasts predict events seldom before observed in the economy.4    Thus, my seco nd objective today is to explain, given this uncertainty about the unemployment -inflation relationship, the important role that risk manag ement plays in setting monetary policy."
Historical P erspective on Jobs and Inflation  Let us start with a look at the modern history of jobs and inflation in the United States.
" Figure 1 shows headline inflation and unemployment from 1960 to today and extended through 2020 using the average of median projection s from  both FOMC participants  and the Survey of Professional Forecasters, and the CBO projections ."
" As the figure makes clear, a  multiyear period with unemployment below 4 percent and s table inflation  would, if realized, be  unique  in modern U.S. data .5   To understand the basis for these forecasts, it is useful to contrast two very  different periods included in  figure  1: From 1960  to 1985, and the period from 1995 to today."
" The first period includes the Great Inflation, and t he latter includes both the Great Moderation and the distinctly immoderate period of the G lobal F inancial Crisis and its aftermath."
"  Figure 2 shows unemployment  and core, rather than headline, inflation in these two periods."
" While our inflation objective concerns headline inflation, s witching to core                                                  4 Herb Stein (1998) made the analogous point that one should doubt the assertion that some program will “cause the economy to perform outside the range of its past experience” (p."
" Unless otherwise noted, all statements about inflation will be four -quarter percent changes in quarterly average data, and all statements about unemployment will be about the quarterly average unemployment rate."
"   - 4 - inflation makes some relationships clearer by remov ing a good deal of variability  due to food and energy prices, variability that is not primarily driven by labor mar ket conditions or monetary policy."
  There is a dramatic differen ce in the unemployment -inflation relation ship across these two periods.
" During the Great Inflation, unemployment fluctuated between roughly 4 percent and 10 percent, and inflation moved over  a similar range."
"  In the recent period, the unemployment rate also fluctuated between roughly 4 percent and 10 percent, but inflation has been relatively  tame , averaging 1.7 percent and never declining below 1 percent or rising to 2.5 percent."
" Even during the financial crisis, core inflation barely budged."
" As a thought experiment, look at the right panel and i magine that you could see only the red line  (inflation),  and not the blue line  (unemployment) ."
" Notice that, in each period, there is only one episode  in which unemployment  drops  below 4 percent ."
" In the late 1960s, unemployment remained at or below 4 percent for fo ur years , and during that time inflation rose steadily from under 2 percent to almost 5 percent ."
" By contrast, t he late 1990s episode of below -4percent  unemployment was quite  brief, and  during the episode and surrounding quarters inflation was reasonably stable and remained below  2 percent."
"  To explore the Phillips curve relation ship in these two periods more closely, we  need to bring in the concept of the natural rate of unemployment."
" In standard economic thinking, an unemployment rate above the natural  rate indicates slack in the labor market and tends to be associated with downward pressure on inflation; unemployment below  - 5 - the natural rate represents a tight labor market and is associated with upward inflation pressure."
     Figure 3 repeats figure 2 b ut replaces unemployment with labor market slack  as measured by unemployment minus the CBO ’s current estimate of the natural rate of unemployment  at each point in time .6  Periods of tight labor markets are shaded.
" During the Great Inflation, inflation generally rose in the tight, shaded periods and fell in the unshaded ones , just as conventional Phillips curve reasoning predicts ."
"  From 1995 to today, the large and persistent swings in the gap between unemployment  and the natural rate w ere associated with,  at most, a move of a few tenths in the inflation rate."
" Comparing the shaded and unshaded regions, you might see some association between slack and the minor ups and downs i n inflation, but the pattern is not at all consistent."
" A Simple F ramework for U nderstanding C hanges in the Jobs -Inflation R elation ship A natural starting point is the simplest form of a Phillips curve equation, which  posits that inflation this year is de termined by some combination of current labor market                                                  6 This estimate is the CBO’s current assessment of what the natural rate was at each period in the sample, not a measure of the natural rate as perceived in real time."
"  - 6 - slack, inflation last year, and some other factors that I will leave aside for this discussion (figure 4) :7 Inflation(t ) = -B Slack( t) + C  Inflation( t - 1) + Other(t)."
" With  a larger value of B , any change in labor market slack translates into a bigger change  in inflation."
" The value of C  determines inflatio n’s persistence-- that is, how long any given change in inflation tends to linger."
" As the value of C  increases, higher inflation this year translates more into higher inflation next year ."
" In t his case, slack has a large effect on inflation, and that effect tends to be very persistent."
" One implication of a large C  is that, if a boom drives inflation up, it will tend to stay up unless offset by a subsequent bust .8    Figure 5 shows regression estimates of B  and C , computed over 20year samples starting with the sample from  1965 to 1984 and including each 20year sample through 2017."
" During the Great Inflation samples, the value of C  is near 1, meaning that higher inflation on e year tended to translate almost onefor-one into higher inflation the next."
" The Phillips curve is also relatively steep in the Great Inflation samples, with 1  extra percentage point of lower  unemployment converting into roughly 1/2 percentage point of higher  inflation."
" Thus, the Great Inflation presented that nasty case just described."
" 8 The text refers to when C is less than 1, in which case a rise in inflation would ultimately die out on its own."
" When C is 1, the Phillips curve is of the “accelerationist” variety, and any offsetting rise in inflation due to labor market tightness would be permanent unless offset  by an equal amount of subsequent slack."
" In the most recent samples, the Phillips cur ve is nearly flat, with B very near zero, and C  is about 0.25, meaning that roughly one fourth of any rise or fall in inflation carries forward."
" These results give numerical form to  what we see in the right -hand panel of f igure 3, covering the recent period:  Large and persistent moves in the unemployment gap were associated with, at most, modest transitory moves in inflation."
" These developments amount to a better world for households and businesses, which no longer experience or even fear the scourge of high and volatile inflation."
" To provide a sound basis for monetary policy, it is important to understand what happened and why, so we can avoid a return to the bad old days of the 1970s."
" Like many, I believe better monetary policy has played a central role.9    To understand the mechanism, let us ask how central banks could, presumably inadvertently, amplify and extend the duration of inflation’s response to labor market tightness."
" To do so, the central bank c ould persistent ly ease the stance of monetary policy in response to an uptick in inflation."
" No responsible central banker today would intentionally do this , but much research suggests that  during the Great Inflation, misunderstandings about how the economy worked led the Fed effectively to behave in this manner.10  Some policymakers may have belie ved the misguided notion that                                                   9 The account I present of the role of anchored expectations in stabilizing the economy and favorably altering Phillips curve dynamics echoes a long -held view a t the Fed."
" 10 To be clear, during the periods of rising inflation in the 1960s and 1970s, the  FOMC was generally raising the federal funds rate, but with inflation rising, the real federal funds rate was rising much more slowly or even falling."
"  - 8 - accommodating permanently higher inflation could purchase permanently higher employment.11  Other  policymakers  misperceived the level of the natural rate of unemployment, which we now believe  had shifted up markedly in the 1960s."
" With the higher natural rate, the labor market was much tighter  and provided much greater upward pressure on inflation than policymakers  realized in real time ."
" As a result, they were continually “behind the curve .”12   The channel through which monetar y policy can amplify and extend inflation’s  response to shocks becomes even stronger when we take account of expectations."
" If people come to expect that upward blips in inflation will result in ongoing higher inflation , they will build that view into wage  and price decisions."
" In this case, people’s expectations become a force adding momentum to inflation, and breaking inflation’s momentum can require convincing people to change their minds and behavior --never an  easy task."
" Arguably, this is why a federal  funds rate near 20 percent --roughly 10 percent  in real terms --was required in the early 1980s to turn the tide on high inflation."
" The cost, in the form of very high unemployment, is clear in the Great Inflation figures."
 The Great Inflation taught us tha t a main task of monetary policy is to keep inflation expectations anchored at some low level.
"  This idea is behind the adoption in recent decades of inflation targets, such as the Fed’s 2 percent objective, by central banks around the world."
" When moneta ry policy tends to offset shocks  to inflation , rather than amplifying and extending them, and when people come to expect this  policy response , a surprise rise or fall in labor market tightness will naturally have smaller and less persistent effects on inflation ."
  - 9 - suggests that this reasoning can account for a good deal of the change in the Phillips curve relationship.13 It is also likely that many other factors have contributed to changes in inflation dynamics over recent decades .
" The baseline forecast s of most FOMC participants and a broad range of others  show unemployment remaining below 4 percent for an extended period, with inflation steady near 2 percent."
" Instead, the outlook is consistent with evidence of a very flat Phillips curve and inflation expectations anchored near 2 percent."
 First is the risk that inflation expectations might lose their anchor.
 We  attribute a great deal of the stability of inflation in recent years to the anchoring of longer -term                                                  13 Yellen (2017) gives a more detailed account of how a very flat Phillips curve with anchored expectations can account well for the recent inflation and unemployment dat a.
" For example, Pfajfar and Roberts, (2018) present evidence that when inflation is more stable, people simply pay less attention to it and that this could help account for changes in the Phillips curve relationship."
  - 10 - inflation expectations .
" T he survey measures have been particularly steady for some time.15  The financial market -based measures include both an expectations component and a volatile inflation premium component, so they tend to move around much more than the surveys, but we see no evidence of a material change in these measures, either."
"  The risks to inflation expectations are, of course, two sided ."
" Until this summer, inflation had remained stubbornly below 2 percent for several years."
 And major economies in much of the world have been struggling mainly with disinflationary forces.
" Some argue the contrary case-- that by only gradually removing accommodation as the unemployment rate has fallen, the FOMC may have fall en behind the curve, thereby risking an upward drift in expectations."
" From the standpoint of contingency planni ng, our course is clear:  R esolutely conduct  policy consistent with the FOMC’s symmetric 2 percent inflation  objective, and stand ready to act with authority if expectations drift  materially up or down."
"A second risk is that labor market tightness or tightness i n other parts of the  production chain might lead to higher inflation pressure than expected --the “revenge of                                                  15 That is, movements in these measures have been modest, especially taking into account precision of the surveys."
"  - 11 - the Phillips curve” scenario.16  As I mentioned, t he FOMC carefully mon itors a wide array of early indicators of inflation pressure  to evaluate this risk ."
" Specifically, the r ise in wages is broadly consistent with observed rates of price inflation and labor productivity growth and therefore does not point to an overheating labor market ."
" Further, higher wage growth alone need not be inflationary."
 The late 1990s episode of low  unemployment saw wages rise faster than inflation plus productivity growth without an appreciable rise in inflation.
"  - 12 - however, that the se measures are near levels that prevailed in the late 1990s or early 2000s , a period when core inflation remained under 2 percent."
"  While the late  1990s case proves that elevated values of these tightness measures do not automatically  translate into rising inflation, a single episode provides only limited reassurance."
"  Thus, the FOMC takes seriously the possibility that tight  markets for labor or other inputs could provide greater upward pressure on inflation than in the baseline outlook."
" Our best estimates, however, s uggest  that so long as inflation expectations remain anchored, a modest steepening of the Phillips curve woul d be unlikely to c ause a significant rise in inflation or demand a disruptive policy tightening.18  Once again, the key is the anchored expectations."
 Is the N atural R ate of Unemployment L ower T han E xpected?
 A third risk --in this case an upside risk --is that the natural rate of unemployment could be even  lower than current estimates .
" Some have argued that the Fed should be removing policy accommodation much more slowly, pushing the economy to see if the natural rate of unemployment is lower still."
" Advocates  of this view note that over the past several years of policy normalization, the  economy has continued to strengthen and unemployment has fallen, but inflation has remained quiet."
" As I discussed in a recent speech, many  analysts have accounted for the lac k of rising inflation pressure by lowering their estimate of the natural rate.19  For example, since the start of 2016, the unemployment rate has fallen about 1 percentage point, and estimates of the natural rate from  four well -known sources have fallen ove r that period between 0.3 percent and 0.7 percent ( figure  9)."
"  - 13 - If the natural rate is now materially lower than we believe, that would imply  less upward pressure on inflation-- the flip side of the “revenge of the Phillips curve” risk."
 Our policy of gradual interest rate normalization represents the FOMC’s attempt to take both of these risks seriously.
 Moving too slowly could risk rising inflation and inflation expectations.
" In light of that experience, I am glad to be able to stand here and say that the economy is strong, unemployment is near 50year lows, and inflation is roughly at our 2 percent objective."
"  This historically rare pairing of steady, low inflation and very low unemployment is testament to  the fact that we remain in extraordinary times."
" Our ongoing policy of gradual interest rate normalization reflects our efforts to balance  the inevitable risks  that  - 14 - come with extraordinary times , so as to extend the current expansion , while maintaining maximum employment and low and stable inflation."
