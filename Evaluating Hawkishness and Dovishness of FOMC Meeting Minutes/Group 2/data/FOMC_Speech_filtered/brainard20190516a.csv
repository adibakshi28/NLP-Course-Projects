"EDT  May 16, 2019 The Disconnect between Inflation and Employment in the New Normal Remarks by  Lael Brainard  Member  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System  at  “Certain Uncertainty:  Tax Policy in Unsettled Times”   National Tax Association 49th Annual Spring Symposium Washington, D.C. May 16, 2019  It is a pleasure to be here at the National Tax Association An nual Spring Symposium ."
" Just as it may take the tax experts and practitioners here today some time to disentangle the longer -term implications of recent major changes to tax policy, so , too, we are in the process of analyzing  the lessons for monetary polic y of apparent  post -crisis changes in the relationships among employment, inflation, and interest rates.1   The Congress has assigned the Federal Reserve the job of us ing monetary  policy to achieve maximum employment and price stability."
" Price stability me ans moderate and stable inflation, which the Federal Reserve has defined to be 2 percent inflation."
 Maximum employment is understood as the highest level of employment consistent with price  stability.
" In the aftermath of the Great Recession , which had de ep and persistent effects , it is important to understand whether there have been longlasting  changes in the relationships among employment, inflation, and interest rates  in order to ensure our policy framework remains effective."
 Employment and Inflation  This expansion will soon become the longest on record in the United States.
" Growth has persisted throughout the past decade, overcoming downdrafts from abroad and pullbacks in fiscal support  earlier in the expansion and  benefiting  last year from  a large fiscal boost."
  The job market is strong .
" At 3.6 percent, t he unemployment rate is now lower  than it was before the crisis."
  - 2 - years —a more comprehensive measure of slack that includes shifts in labor  force participation as well as unemployment —ha s recently risen  close to its  precrisis level.
" In contrast, the picture on inflation is puzzl ing this far into an expansion."
" Despite the strengthening of the labor market, the measure of core inflation  excluding  volatile  food and energy prices  did not move up to 2 percent on a susta ined basis until last year , and in the most recent reading, the 12 -month change has moved down to 1.6 percent."
 Other inflation measures paint a somewhat more reassuring picture.
" The Dallas Fed’s trimmed  mean measure of inflation, which provides a differe nt way to filter out idiosyncratic movements in various c omponents of inflation, has increased 2  percent in the past  12 months, slightly higher than its level  of 1.9 percent  for the two pr evious  years .2   The New Normal  Since the Great Recession , there have been several changes in macroeconomic relationships, which I refer to as the new normal.3  Now is  a good time to assess the characteristics  of the new normal and what they  mean for monetary  policy."
" The emerging contours of today’s new normal ar e defined by low sensitivity of inflation to changes in  labor market slack, a low longterm neutral rate of interest, and low underlying trend inflation."
"  In today’s new normal, price inflation has not moved up consistently as t he labor market has strengthened considerably over the course of the long expansion."
" This is what economists                                                  2 For an assessment of the  relative strengths of the ex -foodand-energy and trimmed  mean measures of personal  consumption expenditures  inflation , see Jim Dolmas and Evan F."

" - 3 - mean when they say the Phillips curve is very flat:  T he historical relationship between resource slack  and price inflation appears to have broken down.4  Although wage growth has been moving progressively  higher  as labor market slack has diminished,  broader price inflation has remained muted."
Another important feature of today’s new normal is that the long -run neutral interest rate seems to be lower than it w as historically.
 The neutral rate of interest refers to the level of the federal funds rate that would maintain the economy at full emplo yment and 2 percent inflation if no tailwinds or headwinds were buffeting the economy.
" Th e decline in the neutral rate likely reflects a variety of forces globally, such as the aging of the population in many large economies, some slowing in the rate of productivity growth, and increas es in the demand for safe assets."
"When one l ooks  at the Federal Reserve’s Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), it is striking that over the past five years, since the SEP  interest rate projections  first became available, th e median estimate of the long -run federal funds rate has declined 1 -1/2 percentage points , from 41/4 percent to 23/4 percent."
" Going back further to the two decades before the crisis  shows a similar  decline in today’s long -run neutral rate relative to  earlier Blue Chip consensus forecasts of the longrun federal funds rate.5 Third , underlying trend inflation—the trend  in inflation  after filtering out idiosyncratic and transitory factors —appears to be somewhat below the Federal Reserve’s goal of 2  percent."
"  This raises the risk that households  and businesses could come to expect inflation to run                                                  4 See Lael Brainard (2015), “ Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy ,” speech delivered at the 57th National Association for Business Economics Annual Meeting, Washington, D.C.

  Expectations are an important determinant of  actual inflation because wage and price behavior by businesses and households  is partly based on expectations of future inflation.
" While low inflation and low interest rates have many benefits, t he new normal presents  a challenge for the con ventional approach to monetary policy, in which the Federal Reserve could rely on changes in the level of the federal funds rate to achieve its inflation and employment goals ."
" In past  recessions, the Federal Reserve has typically cut interest rates by 4 t o 5 percentage points in order to support household and business spending and hiring."
" With the long -run neutral rate low and with underlying trend inflation somewhat below target, nominal interest rates are likely to remain below those levels , which therefore leaves  less room to cut rates as much as needed ."
" With less room to ease financial conditions and support economic activity  using our conventional  policy  tool, the economy may endure prolonged periods  during and after recessions  with short -term intere st rates pinned at their effective lower bound."
" That, of course, was what happened following the financial crisis, when the Federal Reserve kept interest rates close to zero from December 2008 t hrough November 2015."
"  That constraint  limits  the Fed eral Reserve ’s ability to provide stimulus through its conventional tool  and thus  could tend to leave inflation lower than it would otherwise be , and unemployment higher ."
 The experience of several years with the federal funds rate pinned at its effective lower bound and actual inflation below our  target could weigh on expectations for future inflation and thereby influence the behavior  of households and businesses that helps determine wages and prices .
" The experience of a sust ained period of low inflation could depress underlying trend inflation by feeding into lower inflation expectations, further reducing nominal -5 -interest rates and  the space to cut interest rates in what could become a downward spiral.6  So we need to be especially careful to preserve as much of our conventional policy space as we can, while exploring mechanisms to augment the effectiveness of our framework.7 Maximum Employment in the New Normal The new normal has some important benefits."
" With subdued inflation, the sustained expansion has  draw n workers back into the labor market after a damaging recession."
" The unemployment rate is approaching  a 50 -year low , and the overall labor force participation rate has remained constant  despite the longterm aging of th e population that would otherwise be pushing participation lower."
"  Like the overall unemployment rate, broader measures of labor market slack are also lower than their precrisis levels."
 The Bureau of Labor S tatistics ’ U6 measure shows that two groups have recently shrunk to precrisis levels after rising considerably during the recession:  those working part time who would prefer fulltime employment and people marginally attached to the labor force who have looked for work in the previous y ear but stopped looking more recently .
" The strong labor market is leading to employment gains among workers with 6 For a formal model of how this mechanism might work, see Michael T."

"  Given that the large majority of working -age households, those at the middle and lower  ends of the income distribution, rely primarily on wage income, advancing our employment mandate has served the country well."
" In today’s new normal, with the low responsiveness of inflation to labor market tightness, there appears to be little evidence so far of a tradeoff with our pricestability objective."
 The sustained strengthening of the labor market also adds to the productive capacity  of the economy by attracting people on the sidelines to join or rejoin the labor force and move into employment.
" The past three downturns were precipitated not by rising inflation pressure, but rather by the buildup of financial imbalances."
 Extended periods of abovepotential growth and low interest rates tend to be accompanied by rapid credit growth and 8 See Stephanie R.
"Historically, when the Phillips curve was ste eper, inflation tended to rise as the economy heated up, which naturally  prompt ed the F ederal Reserve to raise  interest rates ."
" In turn, the interest rate increases would have the collateral effect of damping increases in asset prices and risk appetite s."
" With a flat Phillips curve, inflation does not rise as much as resource utilization  tightens,  and, accordingly, provides less necessity for  the F ederal Reserve to raise rates  to restrictive levels ."
" At the same time, low interest rates along with sustai ned strong economic conditions are conducive to increasing risk appetite s prompting reach -foryield behavior and boosting financial excesses late in an expansion."
"  With the forces holding down interest rates likely to persist , valuation pressures  and risk y corporate debt, such as leveraged lending, could well  remain at  elevated levels ."

"  - 8 - A key implication of the weakening  in the relationship  between inflation and employment, then , is that we should not assume monetary policy will act to restrain the financial cycle as much as previously ."
" As a consequence, po licymakers may need to think differently about the interplay of the financial and business cycles  due to the combination of a low neutral rate, a flat Phillips curve, and low underlying inflation."
" W ith financial stability risks likely to be more tightly linked to the business cycle than in the past, it may make sense to  take actions other than tightening monetary policy to temper the financial cycle."
" In order to enable monetary policy to focus on supporting the return of inflation to  our symmetric 2 percent  target on a sustained basis along with maximum employment, we should be looking to countercyclical tools to temper the financial cycle."
" - 9 - If countercyclical  tools  and other regulatory safeguards  are not  adequate over the cycle, monetary policy will need to carry a greater burden in leaning against financial excesses."
" That would be unfortunate, because adding financial stability concerns to the burden of conventional monetary policy might undermine sustained achievement of our  employment and inflation goals."
"  Because the financial cycle is today likely to be tempered less than in the past by material increases in interest rates as the economy expands , the a ppropriate level of bank capital for today’s conditions  is unlikely to be the same as  in past business cycles :  Because interest rates  likely will do less  than in past cycles , regulatory buffers will need to do more."
"Achieving our Inflation Objective on a Sustained Basis  Finally, let  us turn to the apparent softness in underlying trend inflation."
" One hypothesis for the flat Phillips curve is that central banks have been so effective in anchoring inflation expectations that tightening resource utilization is  no longer transmitted to price inflation.11  Another possibility is that structur al factors such as administrative changes to health  care costs, globalization, or technological -enabled disruption have been dominant  in recent years , mask ing                                                  11 For evidence that inflation expectations may have played a role in flattening the Phillips curve, see Damjan Pfajfar and John M."

"  - 10 - the operation of cyclical f orces .12  Regard less, because inflation is ultimately a monetary phenomenon, the Federal Reserve has  the capacity and the responsibility to ensure inflation expectations are firmly anchored at —and not below —our target."
" As I have argued in the past, the fact that inflation has been running somewhat below  our longer -run goal of 2 percent may not be entirely due to labor market slack or to transitory shocks; it also likely reflects some so ftening in  inflation’s  underlying  trend .13  First, estimates of underlying inflation based on statistical filters are lower than they were before the financial crisis and are currently below 2  percent."
" Second, estimates of longer -run inflation expectations  based on the University of Michigan S urvey s of Consumer s and on inflation compensation from  financial market pricing are also running lower than before the financial crisis.14   Our goal now is  to get underlying trend inflation around our target on a susta ined basis."
" Although t here is no one widely agreed -upon method of measuring underlying inflation, one statistical approach  that has received attention in recent years  captures the idea that underlying inflation responds  to the                                                  12 For a discuss ion of cyclical and acyclical inflation, see Tim Mahedy and Adam Shapiro (2017), “What’s Down with Inflation?” FRBSF Economic Letter 201735 (San Francisco:  Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, November), https://www.frbsf.org/economic -research/files/el2017 -35.pdf ."

14 The Michigan survey’s measure of inflation expectations recently moved down to its alltime low.
" - 11 - experience with actual inflation , and that this responsiveness varies over time .15  We can use such an approach to get an idea of how much, and how quickly, underlying inflation might respond to an y particular path for actual inflation."
  It provides some reassurance that our goal may be achievable if inflation moves only slightly above 2 percent for a couple of years.
" The SEP inflation projections of Committee members suggest that many have, over the past year or so, envisaged a few years of a mild overshoot .16   Of course , it is not entirely clear how to  move underlying trend inflation smoothly to our target on a sustained basis  in the presence of a very flat Phillips curve ."
" One possibility we migh t refer to as “ opportunistic reflation” would be to take advantage of  a modest  increase in  actual  inflation to demonstr ate to the public our commitment to our inflation goal on a symmetric basis .17  For example, suppose that an unexpected increase in core i mport price inflation  drove overall inflation modestly above 2  percent  for a couple of years ."
 The F ederal Reserve could use that opportunity to communicate that a mild overshooting of inflation is consistent with our goals and to align policy with that statement .
 Such an approach could help demonstrate to  the public that the Committee is serious about achiev ing its 2  percent inflation objective on a sustained basis.
"Watson (2007), “Why Has U.S. Inflation Become Harder to Forecast?” Journal of Money, Credit and Banking, vol."
 Their model allows the responsiveness of underlying inflation to actual inflation to vary over time and suggests that responsiveness—the “gain” —has been lower in recent years than in the 1970s and 1980s.

" We want to be mindful of the risk of financial imbalances that could amplify any shock and hel p tip the economy into recession, which the Federal Reserve has less conventional space to address in today’s low interest rate environment."
" In my view, it is therefore wise to proceed cautiously, helping to sustain the expansion and further gains in employment and with appropriate regulatory safeguards that reduce the risk of dangerous financial imbalances."
