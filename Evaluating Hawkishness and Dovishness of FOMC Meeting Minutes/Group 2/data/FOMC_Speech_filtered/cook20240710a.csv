"     For release on delivery  7:30 p.m. EDT  (9:00 a .m., July 11 , local time)  July 10 , 2024          Common Inflation and M onetary Policy Challenges  across Countries     Remarks by   Lisa D."
" Examining  the common inflation experiences and monetary policy challenges across several countries , including Australia and the United States, is a help ful exercise for policymakers and economists alike ."
" Today , I will first talk about how monetary policymakers responded in similar fashion to the C OVID -19 pandemic and , later, to high inflation during the recovery."
 I will discuss common features of the recent inflation experience across countries and the importance of global shocks.
" With disinflation  in train  across most countries , I will consider what we can learn from past cycles of monetary easing."
 I will finish with a discussion of how the use of alternative scenarios could help monetary policymakers communicate how they might respond to a range of possible economic outcomes.
" Common Monetary Policy Response to the Pandemic  In the spring of 2020, economies around the world shut down or sharply limited business  activity, especially for in -person services , including dining out and traveling ."
" The Rise of Inflation and the Common Monetary Policy Response  Over the course of 2021, as financial conditions improved , a strong recovery in consumer demand  outpaced still constrained supply capacity  in many countries , leading      - 3 - to production and transportation bottlenecks, which ultimately resulted in inflation."
" The surge in inflation was initially mostly concentrated in finished goods  and commodities but later spread to services .2  As the economy started reopening with the lifting of lockdowns and rollout of vaccines, demand for services picked up."
" Similar to what played out with goods, the pickup in demand for services ran into a constrained supply of service workers."
" As services are more labor  intensive than goods, and labor supply was still reeling from the consequences of the pandemic, the rebalancing of consumption from goods to services led to higher rates of  inflation  and nominal wage growth ."
"  In response to rising  inflation, central banks around the world started to remove some of the support that they provided during the height of the pandemic."
  Then  some central banks began to raise interest rates.
" The first to do so were EME central banks that saw particularly sharp increases in inflation driven by exchange rate depreciation  and by the surge in prices for food, which makes up a large part of the consumption baskets in their economies ."
" Advanced economy central banks generally were more patient on raising interest rates in 2021, as inflation expectations in their economies were better anchored than in emerging economies ."
" The BOE  first raised its policy rate in Dec ember 2021, citing a strong labor market and sharply rising inflation."
" Understanding the R ise and Fall of Inflation  in Recent Years   The inflation surge in the aftermath of  the COVID -19 pandemic  was synchronized across advanced and emerging economies , as figure 2 illustrates ."
" The rapid increase in prices reflected an upswing in  demand for goods, strained supply chains , tight labor markets , and sharp hikes in commodity prices exacerbated by Russia ’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine ."
" The run -up was not only for overall  headline  inflation , but also for its core component s."
A plethora  of factors can explain the global co -movement in headline and core inflation.
" The pandemic experience was also a stark reminder of the importance of international trade and input -output linkages for the propagation of supply shocks —for example , production and shippin g disruptions in the semiconductor industry in Asia constraining production and creating important price pressures in downstream markets , such as motor vehicles in the U.S.      - 5 - Research on the recent inflation  episode  is still very much in its infancy , and I look forward to learning from the ongoing work  on the subject."
  One important contribution already is Ben Bernanke and Olivier Blanchard ’s analysis of pandemic -era inflation in 11 economies.
  Separate teams for each of the 11 economies estimated a  comparable  model of inflation  and its drivers.
"and, with some variation , for other countries that “ relative price shocks and sectoral shortages drove the initial surge in inflation, but as these effects have reversed, tight labor markets in most (although not all) countries have become a relatively more important factor."
"”3   In a recent F EDS  Note s article , economists at the Federal Reserve Board took head -on the task of decomposing world inflation into common and country -specific components and using this decomposition to analyze the sources of inflation  around the world .4  Despite the different approach, they  reached conclusions broadly in line with those of Bernanke and Blanchard ."
" As shown in figure 3, they find that the global component s of inflation accounted for a large part of the variation in the average inflation around the world during the post -COVID period ."
  This study also found that t he global components of inflation also predict  the path of near -term inflation .
" This persistence  and the recent decline in global components of core and noncore inflation suggest that the world disinflationary process  3 See Ben Bernanke and Olivier Blanchard  (2024) , “An Analysis of Pandemic -Era Inflation in 11 Economies ,” Hutchins Center Working Paper 91  (Washington:  Brookings Institution , May ), quoted text on p."
"4 See Danilo Cascaldi -Garcia, Luca Guerrieri, Matteo Iacoviello , and Michele Modugno  (2024) , “Lessons from the Co -Movement of Inflation around the World ,” FEDS  Note s (Washington:  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,  June 28), https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds -notes/lessons -from -theco-movement -ofinflation -around -theworld -20240628.html ."
 The predicted path is  in line  with a gradual return of inflation toward central  bank targets .
"Of note, as shown in figure 5, the authors  find that the postpandemic  rise in global inflation was linked to both commodity -driven price shocks and shocks to global economic activity —such as the sharp decline and rebound in activity due to the COVID -19 pandemic and the associated labor market shortages."
"  This situation contrasts with the 1 970s and 1980s, when commodity price shocks played a prominent role in inflation’s fluctuations ."
" Additionally, idiosyncratic shocks were important drivers of the surge in global inflation in 2022 and its decline in 2023."
" In sum, through the lens of the model, the ongoing disinflation is driven by waning effects of commodity price shocks and by a gradual normalization of global economic activity , amid the resolution of shortages and imbalances in labor markets."
" Current Common Monetary Policy Challenges  With global components of inflation turning down, most countries have experienced a significant fall in inflation relative to its peak."
" Some are considering how long to keep rates at restrictive levels or, if inflation picks up again, whether to raise rates further."
" The Bank of Canada, the ECB,  the Swedish Riksbank , and the Swiss National Bank, have begun to cut policy rates , highlight ing progress toward meeting inflation goals amid  sustained softness in economic activity ."
" Indeed, unlike in the U .S., the level of gross domestic product (GDP)  in some advanced economies  remains well below what      - 7 - would be implied by their respective pre -COVID  GDP trends .5  Even among those cutting rates, however, the future path of the policy rate is generally seen as dependent on a continuing decline of inflation toward target levels."
" For all central banks, the question is how best to ensure continued disinflation while avoiding unnecessary damage to the economy."
"  The generally desired outcome is a soft landing, in which inflation returns to the central bank’s target  inflation level or range  without inducing a recession  or a large increase in unemployment ."
 But Fed Board staff have examined past episodes of monetary policy easing in 13 advanced economies over the past five decades.
" They find that soft landings are rare, according to their analysis published in another  recent F EDS  Note s article .6  In most of the cases that they stud ied, central banks  were not successful in bringing inflation back to near target  in a timely manner ."
" And when they were successful in taming inflation, i t often was associated with a recession."
 Soft landings were also more likely when policy easing began with inflation already  close to target and when there was a relatively firm growth backdrop.
" In the U .S., what I have seen so far appears to be consistent with a soft landing:  Inflation has fallen significantly from its peak , and  5 See François de Soyres, Joaquin Garcia -Cabo Herrero, Nils Goernemann, Sharon Jeon, Grace Lofstrom, and Dylan Moore (2024) , “Why Is the U .S."
 It is possible that some features of the recent inflation episode may make a soft landing more likely  in countries around the globe .
" As I discussed, Bernanke and Blanchard found that much of the inflation episode came from relative price shocks and sectoral shortages that have since been resolved."
" And while they found that tight labor markets have since taken over as the main drivers of inflation, there are signs that such tightness i s easing."
" Thus, my baseline forecast (and that of many outside observers) is that inflation will continue to move tow ard target over time, without much further rise in unemployment."
" Monetary Policy Communications  Of course, forecasts are subject to considerabl e uncertainty, and policymakers must consider a range of possible outcomes."
 A key challenge of monetary policy communications is discussing how policy would respond to changes in the economic outlook.
"     - 9 - In his recent review of forecasting for monetary policymaking and communications at the B OE, Ben Bernanke suggested that the Bank consider supplementing its published forecasts with the use of alternative scenarios to help the public understand its policy reaction function.7  For similar reasons I try to incorporate a discussion of alternative scenarios in my own speeches."
"  The BOE was an early innovator with its fan charts , which emphasized that its forecasts for GDP and inflation were subject to growing uncertainty the longer the time horizon."
" Since 2012, t he Federal Reserve’s Summary of Economic Projections also includes the path of the policy rate that each policymaker  “deems most likely to foster outcomes for economic activity and inflation that best satisfy his or her individual interpretation of the statutory mandate to  7 See Ben S."
"Bernanke  (2024) , Forecasting for Monetary Policy Making and Communication at the Bank of England:  A Review  (London:  Bank of England, April ), https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/independent -evaluation -office/forecasting -formonetary -policy -making -andcommunication -atthe-bank -ofengland -areview/forecasting -formonetary -policy -making -andcommunication -atthe-bank -ofengland -areview ."
     - 10 - promote maximum employment and price stability .”8  I continue to take great interest in communications and other monetary policy practices by foreign central banks.
" What is not unique to the pandemic is that we often have common macroeconomic experiences and face common monetary policy challenges , which is what make s discussions like the one today so valuable ."
