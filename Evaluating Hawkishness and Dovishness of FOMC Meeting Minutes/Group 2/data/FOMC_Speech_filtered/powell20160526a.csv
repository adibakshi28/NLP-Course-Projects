"For release on delivery  12:15 p.m. EDT  May 26, 2016          Recent Economic Developments, the Productive Potential of the Economy,  and Monetary Policy     Remarks by   Jerome H."
" I will begin by reviewing recent economic developments and then turn to supply -side considerations , such as the level of potential output and the potential growth of our economy."
 I will conclude with a discussion of monetary policy.
" Employment has surpassed its 2008 peak by 5 million workers, and the unemployment rate has fallen from 10 percent to 5 percent, close to the level that many observers associate with full employment."
" Job growth continues to be substantially faster than the underlying growth of the labor force, so the labor market continues to tighten."
" Despite the strong job gains, the unemployment rate has flattened out at 5 percent over the past six months thanks to a welcome increase in the labor force participation rate."
" Meanwhile, there are tentative and encouraging signs of a firming in wages, seen most clearly in the data on average hourly earnings, which are rising faster than inflation and productivity."
 Growth of personal consumption slowed noticeably in the first quarter.
" As a result, gross domestic product ( GDP ) growth  - 2 - over the two quarters end ing in  March 2016 is estimated to have averaged only 1 percent on an annualized basis."
 This estimate may continue to move around as more data come in.1  And there are good reasons to think that underlying growth is stronger than these recent readings suggest.
" Labor market data generally provide a better real -time signal of the underl ying pace of economic activity.2  In addition, retail sales surged in April, as did consumer confidence  in May , suggesting that the pause in consumption may have been transitory."
" Moreover, stronger demand would be more consistent with an environment that remains quite supportive of growth, with low interest rates, low gasoline prices, solid real income gains, a high ratio of household wealth to income, healthy levels of business and household confidence, and continuing strong job creation."
" Indeed, current  forecasts for second -quarter  GDP growth are for a rebound to around 21/4 percent.3   Inflation remains below the 2 percent target  of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) , with total inflation as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures at 3/4 percent over the 12 months ending in March and core inflation at 1 -1/2 percent, both slightly higher than a year earlier."
" Core inflation has been held down by falling import price s, owing in large part to the rise in the dollar, as well as the indirect effects of lower oil prices on core prices."
" If oil prices an d the dollar remain broadly stable, inflation should move up further over time to our 2 percent objective."
" Inflation expectations seem to be under some downward                                                  1 For exam ple, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, a 70 percent  confidence band around the estimate o f first -quarter GDP would extend from negative 0.7 percent to 1.7 percent , which implies that the spending data should be taken with a grain of salt."
 2 Analysis by Board staff finds that lagged employment growth provides a better signal of current -quarter GDP or employment growth t han does lagged GDP growth.
" 3 For example, the May Blue Chip forecast for second -quarter real GDP growth was 2.3 percent, and the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s GDPNow forecasting model predicted 2.5 percent, as of May 17."
" While I see expectations as stay ing reasonably well anchored, it is essential that they remain so and that inflation return over time to the 2 percent objective."
" However, underlying risks will likely remain until global growth is on a stronger footing."
 Growth and inflation remain stubbornly low for most of our major trading partners.
" In China, stimulus measures should support growth  in the near term but may also sl ow China’s necessary transition away from its exportand investment -led business model."
 There is also some remaining uncertainty about China’s exchange rate policy.
"   Despite these downside risks, I see U.S. demand growing at a moderate pace, the labor market continuing to heal, and inflation returning over time to the FOMC’s 2 percent objective."
 The economy is on track to attain the Committee’s dual mandate of stable prices and maximum employment.
"  Supply -Side Considerations  For several years after th e crisis, economic activity remained far below its potential , and the need for highly accommodative policy seemed clear."
" As the shortfall  - 4 - of output from  potential has narrowed, supply -side considerations such as the level and growth rate of potential output naturally begin to matter more for policy."
" Throughout the recovery period, forecasters have consistently overestimated bot h actual and potential GDP growth while underestimating the rate of job creation and the pace of decline of the unemployment rate ( table  1)."
" For example, in 2007, the average expectation for longrun GDP growth from the Blue Chip s urvey of 50 forecasters was 2.9 percent  (table 2) ."
 Blue Chip forecasters also underestimated the decline in the unemployment rate .
" Output growth can be decomposed into increases in hours worked and changes in output per hour, or productivity growth."
" For the United States, much of the post -crisis decline in estimates of potential output growth  appears to  reflect weak labor productivity growth rather than damage to labor supply."
 Labor productivity has increased only 1/2 percent per year since 2010--the slowest five -year growth rate since World War II and about one -fourth  of the average postwar rate (figur e 2).
" For further perspective, productivity growth averaged 11/2 percent during the socalled slow productivity period from  1974 to 1995 and 3 percent during the techboom decade from  1995 to 2005."
  One factor holding back productivity in recent years has been the meager growth  in the business sector’s capital stock  (figure  4).
 This weakness is consistent with the weak recovery in demand .4  Another important factor is the marked decline in total factor productivity (TFP) growth (figure  5).
" TFP is that part of pr oductivity that is not explained by capital investment or labor quality; it is thought to be mainly a function of technological innovation.5  A broad decline in the dynamism in our economy may also be contributing to lower TFP.6  There is strong evidence that the slowdown in TFP growth in the United States preceded the financial crisis, particularly in sectors that produce or use information technologies.7                                                          4 See Eugenio Pinto and Stace y Tevlin (2014), “Perspectives on the Recent Weakness in Investment,” FEDS Notes (Washington:  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, November 21), www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/notes/feds -notes/2014/perspectives -onthe-recent -weakness -ininvestments -20140521.html ."
 Their analysis indicates that investment growth over the expansion has been consiste nt with a model using business output growth and the user cost of capital.
"  5 Over long periods of time total factor productivity is primarily driven by innovation, knowledge and the efficiency with which  inputs are put to use owing to the evolution of business practices as well as the influences of public capital stock , government regulations and other factors."
"  7 See John Fernald (2014) , “Productivity and Potential Output before, during, and after the Great Recession,” NBER Macroeconomics Annual, vol."
" Some have argued that part of the TFP slowdown may actually be a measu rement problem, owing to the difficulty in measuring the productivity of health care, information technology, and other services."
"Reinsdorf (2016), “Does the United States Have a Productivity Slowdown or a Measurement Problem?” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity , March 4, www.brookings.edu/about/projects/bpea/papers/2016/byrne -etal-productivity -measurement ."
" - 6 - The range of opinions on the future path of productivity growth is  wide, and the historical record provides ample grounds for humility.8  A middle -ground position that seems to underlie many current forecasts is that productivity is probably still being held down by cyclical factors  and lingering effects of the crisis ."
" As those factors dissipate, labor productivity growth should move up to 11/2 percent or so, the lower end of its longer -run range."
"  In addition to productivity, the other principal factor in potential output is labor supply, whi ch is determined by the working -age population, the natural rate of unemployment , and the trend labor force participation rate."
 Both the natural rate of unemployment and labor force participation initially appeared to suffer c risisrelated damage.
  The natural rate of unemployment reflects the matching of characteristics that employers are seeking with those of the unemployed.
" But there are other factors, such as demographic change, that may have led to a decline in the natural rate of unemployment.9  Blue Chip forecasters’ estimate of the natural rate have now returned to around 5 percent, about the same as before the c risis, suggesting that                                                  8 On the pessimistic end of the spectrum are analysts such as Robert Gordon; among the optimists are Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee."

Norton)."
"  9 For example, o lder labor force cohorts ha ve lower participation but also lower unemployment rates."

" The United States now stands at the low end of labor force participation for both men and women in this age group-- above Italy, but well below Germany, France, and Spain.12   Lower potential growth would likely translate into lower estimates of the level of interest rates necessary to sustain stable prices and full emp loyment."
" S ome of the decline in longer -term rates is explained by lower estimates of potential growth, and some by other factors such as very low term premiums ."
" To sum up so far, estimates of longrun potential growth of the U.S. economy have dropped from about 3 percent to about 2 percent in the wake of the c risis, with much of the decline a function of s lower productivity growth."
 The decline in realized productivity growth seems to be driven both by low c apital investment that is well explained by weak demand and by lower TFP growth.
 Expectations of lower productivity growth going forward are more a function of slower gains in TFP.
 Lower potential output growth would mean that interest rates will remain below their pre -crisis levels even after the output gap is fully closed and inflation returns to 2 percent.
" One recent analysis suggests that about one -third of the time , there is no permanent supply -side damage; about one -third of the time , there is a reduction in the level of potential output but not its subsequent growth rate; and about one -third of the time, there is a reduction both in the level of output and in the growth rate.14  Unfortunately, recent experience suggests that the United States is at risk of falling in the last category  (figure  7)."
" We need policies that support labor force participation and the d evelopment of skills, business hiring and investment, and productivity growth-- policies that are, for the most part, outside the remit of the Federal Reserve."
 Monetary policy can contribute by continuing to support the expansion as long as inflation remains consistent with our 2 percent objective and inflation expectations remain stable.

"  14 See Blanchard, Cerutti, and Summers , “Inflation and Activity,” in note 1 3."
" In some cases, the link between recessions and future growth may reflect “reverse causation,” whereby the recession is caused by the realizati on that future growth will be lower than had been expected."
 Improved matching is reducing the natural rate of unemployment.
" Over a longer period, stronger demand should support increased investment, driving productivity higher."
  Realtime estimates of potential output are highly uncertain ; forecasts of potential growth even more so.
 We can  estimate growth of the working -age population reasonably well.
" If the optimists are right, then there will eventually be another wave of high produc tivity growth driven by the truly remarkable evolution of technology."
" That would mean higher potential growth, faster increases in  living standards, and also a return to higher interest rates over time."
" What if the pessimists are right and productivity gr owth remains low for another decade, or indefinitely?"
 The consequences would include lower potential growth and relatively lowe r living standards.
"  Monetary Policy  The implications for mo netary policy of these supply -side issues have been limited, but they begin to matter more as we near full employment."
"  For the near term, my baseline expectation is that our economy will continue on its path of growth at around 2 percent."
" To confirm tha t expectation, it will be important  - 11 - to see a significant strengthening in growth in the second quarter  after the apparent softness of the past two quarters."
" To support this growth narrative , I also expect the ongoing healing process in labor markets to continue , with strong job growth, further reductions  in headline unemployment and other measures of slack , and increases  in wage inflation ."
" As the economy tightens, I expect that inflation will continue to move over time to the Committee’s 2 percent objective."
" Several factors suggest that the pace of rate increases should be gradual, including the asymmetry of risks at the zero lower bound, downside risks from weak global demand and geopolitical events, a lower longrun neutral federal funds rate, and the apparently elevated sensitivity of financial conditions to monetary policy."
" It is possible that monetary policy could push resource utilization too high, and that inflation would move temporarily above target."
" In an era of anchored inflation expectations, undershooting the natural rate of unemployment should result in only a small and temporary increa se in the inflation rate.15  But running the economy above its potential growth rate for an extended period could involve significant risks even if inflation does not move meaningfully above target."
" A  long  period of very low interest rates could lead to ex cessive risk -taking and,                                                  15  See, for example, Laurence Ball and Sandeep Mazumder (2011), ""The Evolut ion of Inflation Dynamics and the Great Recession,"" Brookings Papers on Economic Activity , (Spring), pp."

"   - 12 - over time , to unsustainably high asset prices and credit growth."
" Thus, developments along these lines could ultimately present a difficult set of tradeoffs for monetary policy.16 Conclusion  To wrap up, with the support of monetary accommodation, our economy has made substantial progress."
 My view is that a continued gradual return to more normal monetary policy settings will give us the best chance to continue to  make up lost ground.
