" Before I dig a bit deeper into these questions , including the critical importance of prioritiz ing supervisory and regulatory actions, I’d like to offer a few thoughts on the economy and monetary policy."
"  After sharply tightening monetary policy over the past year and a half to reduce inflation, at our November meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) voted to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5¼ to 5½ percent and continued the run off of the Fed’s securities holdings."
"  We have seen considerable progress on lowering inflation, but inflation remains high and recent readings have been uneven."
" The latest personal consumption expenditure (PCE) inflation index data showed 12month changes in total and core inflation of 3.4 percent  and 3.7 percent , roughly similar to the previous month’s reading."
" However, some components of core services inflation have picked up, and I see a continued risk that core services inflation remains stubbornly persistent."
" In my view, there is also a  risk that higher energy prices could reverse some of the progress made to bring overall inflation down."
" The economy has remained strong as the FOMC raised the federal funds rate, and recent data indicate that economic activity has accelerated with real gross domestic product (GDP) growing at a 4.9 percent annual rate in the third quarter."
   - 3 - The latest employment report showed a labor market with healthy job gains.
" Over the past year, labor force participation has improved with the average pace of job gains slowing somewhat, a sign that labor market supply and demand may be coming into better balance."
" While I continue to expect that we will need to increase the federal funds rate further to bring inflation down to our 2 percent target in a timely way, I supported the FOMC’s decision last week to hold the target range for the federal funds rate at the current level as we continue to assess incoming information and its implications for the outlook."
" There are a number  of potential factors  that may be influencing t erm premiums,  including an improved economic outlook, higher  Treasury debt issuance,  - 4 - concerns about future inflation risk, and higher uncertainty about the future path of the economy and monetary policy."
 I  will continue to monitor these and the broader financial conditions to observe  changing conditions and any potential effects on economic activity and inflation and to better understand the implications for appropriate monetary policy.
"Treasury market plays a central role in the transmission of monetary policy, in financing the federal government, and in providing safe and liquid assets to support the flow of capital and credit to households and businesses."
" More broadly, I believe we should keep in mind that w e don’t yet know the effects  of tightened financial conditions on economic activity and inflation."
 But I will be closely watching the incoming data as I assess the implications for the economic outlook and appropriate monetary policy.
  It is important to note  that monetary policy is not on a preset course.
 I  remain willing to support rais ing the federal funds rate at a future meeting should the incoming data indicate that progress on inflation has stalled or is insufficient to bring inflation  down to 2 percent in a timely way.
 Returning inflation to the FOMC’s  2 percent goal is necessary to achieve a sustainably strong labor market and an economy that works for everyone.
" The current framework represents a riskbased, tailored approach, which strives to align regulation with institution and activity risk , fulfilling  the congressional mandate to tailor the prudential regulatory framework.2  The current level of capital in the U.S. banking system is a strength, not a weakness, which  is complemented by liquidity regulations and other prudential requirements that have  2  Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, Pub."
" The revisions to the market risk rule alone will increase risk -weighted assets from $430 billion to $760 billion for Category I and II firms, and from $130 billion to $220  - 9 - billion for Category III and IV firms.3  These increases are significant , with broadbased  impacts, affecting business and municipal financing, risk management, hedging of foreign exchange and interest rate risk , or managing the risks of fluctuating commodity prices through hedging activities ."

" Ultimately, the net result of this proposal may be to simply shift costs from merchants to bank customers, and to make those costs far less transparent (for example, if those costs are recovered through higher loan interest rates)."
" If the supervisory process fail s to identify and escalat e critical risks or to hold management accountable for known deficiencies, such as excess interest rate risk taking, that raises the potential for supervisory shortcomings, including impacting the  - 20 - ability  of supervisors  to anticipate how changes in the economy or banking sector could affect a bank’s condition."
" The lessons learned from supervisory failures during the bank stress in the spring clearly illustrate that bank examiners and bank management should focus on core issues, like credit risk, interest rate risk, and  - 21 - liquidity risk."
