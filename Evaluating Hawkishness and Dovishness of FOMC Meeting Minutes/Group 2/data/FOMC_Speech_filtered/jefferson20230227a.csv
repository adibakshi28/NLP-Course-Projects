"For release on delivery  10:30 a.m. EST  February 27, 2023          Recent Inflation and the Dual Mandate     Remarks by   Philip N."
" Take the recent  inflation, for example ."
 This may be your first experience with high inflation.
" While we have all experienced prices going up, it’s challenging to measure inflation itself and its consequences ."
" Today, I want to do the following:  discuss with you di fferent ways to measure inflation, characterize our recent inflation, and contextualize the battle against inflation in terms of the Fed’s dual -mandate goals of price stability and maximum employment."
"Different Ways to Measure Inflation  The two primary measures of the price level in the United States are the consumer price index, commonly referred to as the CPI, and the personal consumption expenditures price index, commonly referred to as the PCE  price index ."
 Positive changes in these indexes are recorded as inflation.
" Each inflation measure has both total (or headline) and core subindexes, which I will talk about later."
" The CPI and PCE price indexes are constructed in broadly similar ways, but there are impor tant differences between them .1  Both indexes measure inflation using a specific basket of goods and services  consumed by households."
"  health -care services or housing services inflation behave differently than other prices, this can lead to differences in PCE versus CPI inflation."
"The substitution effects captured by the PCE price index is one reason why PCE inflation (black line) is, almost always, lower than CPI inflation (red line), as you can see in figure 1."
" The core subindex is the total index excluding food and energy prices .2  Food and energy prices are more volatile than other prices, which makes total inflation more volatile ."
" influence of monetary policy, such as geopolitical developments (for example, those associated with fluctuations in energy prices) or weather or disease or war (for example, in the case of food prices)."
" T he FOMC  has chosen to target the PCE price index because it  is broader and it captures more accurately what households are actually consuming.3  In addition, food and energy account for a significant portion of household budgets, so the Federal Reserve’s inflation objective is defined in terms of the total PCE price index, but the Fed monitors the core PCE price index, as well as other inflation indicators, in order to identify evolving inflation trends.4  Select Components of Core PCE Inflation  Now, I would like to dig a bit deeper into recent inflation trends."
" Figure 3 shows recent inflation rates for each component:  goods excluding food and energy (black line), housing services (blue line), and services excluding housing and energy (red line)."
 I look at these three categories separately because what has been causing inflation in each of these sectors is somewhat different .
 Understanding the different causes and how they affect the different components could help the FOMC  predict the future course of inflation .
" Since  3 The Fed’s Monetary Policy Report  explains why the Fed chooses the PCE price index to the CPI (see Board of Governors, 2000, footnote 1)."
" Notwithstanding this preference, the FOMC relies on a variety of aggregate price measures, as well as other information on prices and costs, in assessing the path of inflation."
" 4 For an exp lanation of how the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System evaluates changes in inflation, see Board of Governors (2016)."
" monetary policy affects the economy (and inflation) with a lag, the Committee  is always forward looking."
" Focusing on the price of core goods, the black line in figure 3, you can see how goods prices rose sharply in the second half of 2020 due to both a rapid shift in demand toward goods and unprecedented disruptions to global supply chains."
 As so many were isolatin g themselves —especially those of us lucky enough to have jobs that let us work remotely —there was a sharp shift in demand from services (eating out and traveling) to durable goods (like stationary bicycles) to make our stay -athome experience more pleasant .
 The imbalance between supply and demand for goods resulted in a  sharp increase of prices.
" At the end of 2021, once vaccines were developed and deployed and people slowly emerged from isolation, there was a partial shift in demand back to services, and supply chain bottlenecks started to ease."
" Thus, inflation in this  category started to come down and has come down substantially."
" In contrast to core goods, housing services inflation, the blue dashed line in figure 3, has not started to come down yet."
" Like core goods, demand in the housing sector underwent a major shift during the pandemic."
 The surge in work from home shown in figure 4 led to an increase in the demand for bigger homes located in smaller metro areas or further from city centers.
 T hese shifts in demand happened much more rapidly than the response in housing supply.
"  We have not seen a decline in housing services inflation, but there are indications that we soon will."
" Market rents are now increasing much more slowly than over 2021 and much of 2022, suggesting that housing services inflation will eventually slow ."
"Lastly, inflation in other core services, the red line back in figure 3, is a large category that covers activities as varied as travel and recreation , and medical and legal services."
 Inflation for these services has remained stubbornly high.
" As other Governors and I have noted in the past, an important source of inflation pressures in this category has likely been  the shortage of workers, which has pushed up labor costs at rates above those consistent with 2 percent inflation."
" The inflation outlook for this nonhousing category of core services partly depends on whether growth in nominal labor costs comes back down, and recent data suggest that labor compensation has indeed started to decelerate somewhat over the past year."
" Although I have focused on core inflation because it is more useful for assessing trends in inflation, we also closely follow food and energy prices given that our target is for total inflation and that food and energy prices are very important for many households."
 Both food and energy inflation rose sharply following the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
" But more recently, food inflation has slowed somewhat, as global food prices have retraced some of their earlier increases, while energy prices have fallen noticeably."
" Because energy prices are shaped primarily by global developments and not by U.S. mone tary policy, there is a lot of uncertainty about the future course of energy inflation."
"   In summary, core goods inflation has started to come down."
 Several indicators suggest that housing services inflation is likely to come down in the coming months.
 There is more uncertainty surrounding inflation in core services excluding housing.
" Over time, we’ll learn more about inflation dynamics in this sector."
" Benefits of Price Stability and a Target of 2 Percent  So far, I’ve talked about how to measure inflat ion, about different subcomponents , and about drivers of inflation."
 I will now discuss the benefits of price stability and a longer -run 2 percent inflation rate target.
" Deviations from price stability in the form of persistently elevated inflation  rates are costly for the economy for several reasons, some  of which I’ll review now.5 Fundamentally, a low and stable inflation rate is beneficial for the decisionmaking processes of households and firms."
" If the prospect of high inflation or uncertainty about future inflation factors  5 For examples of r esearch  on the costs of inflation , see Fischer and Modigliani (1978), Fischer (1981), McCallum (1990), Shiller (1997) , and Feldstein (1999)."
 See also the implications for monetary policy drawn by Bernanke  and others  (1999) .
"heavily into firms’ and households’ calculations, it is less likely that resources will be allocated to activities that raise the productive potential of the economy, rather than  into areas that are only made attractive by the presence of high and variable inflation.6 There are other economic costs of high inflation."
" In the labor market, as nomi nal wages are often set in advance, bouts of unanticipated inflation  typically  lead to  a drop in workers’ real wages in the short run, and this is a burden on households in meeting their expenses.7 More generally, even anticipated rates of inflation can produce redistributions of income."
 Such redistributions are also likely to be adverse for members of society who do not have ready access to the kinds  of financial instruments that would best protect  them against high inflation .
 The likelihood of wide -ranging distortions due to inflation is enhanced by the fact that the U.S. tax code does not fully take inflation  into account.
" Consequently, as stressed in fundamental work by the late Martin Feldstei n of Harvard University, high inflation can distort saving and investment decisions, including through the treatment of after -tax capital  gains .8  Another reason why deviations from price stability distort decisions and redistribute income lies in the fac t that much of our  financial system, including many arrangements pertaining to retirement plans, is structured in terms of streams of nominal payments.9  Absent a background of a steady and predictable inflation rate, the purchasing power of retirement income streams and other payments may turn out to be very different from what was envisioned when they were originally arranged."
 6 One long -standing effect of inflation is that it creates incentives that would not otherwise be present to economize on low -interestbearing money balances.
" More broadly, an inflationary environment may distort portfolio decisions."
" 7 Ultimately, nominal wage contra cts will adjust to reflect a higher longer -run inflation rate."
" Consequently, inflation tends to drain worker purchasing power in the short run."
" 9 Owing to contractual and other institutional arrangements, it may be difficult to adjust these streams of payments promptly once it emerges that the inflation rate is higher or lower than expected."
" This increase in the real value of debts due to very low inflation or, worse, outright deflation would also be a burden on all households that have  outstanding fixed nominal student loans, auto loans, or credit card debt, a s well as businesses that had taken out bank loans or issued bonds."
"In 2012, the FOMC set a formal inflation target to help households and businesses understand our goal and help keep inflation expectations anchored over time."
" T he FOMC’s choice of a 2 per cent inflation rate , instead of zero , reflected the judgment that reasonable price stability was desirable while also recognizing  the reality that very low inflation can also be  economically  costly.10  In addition, a  zero percent goal would make the longer -run nominal interest rate 2 percent age points  lower than would be the case under a 2 percent inflation goal ."
 A zeroinflation environment  would consequently restrict the FOMC’s scope to lower nominal interest rates when this was necessary for stabilizati on purposes .
" In contrast, a 2 percent inflation rate is still low enough to be consistent with price stability but gives the FOMC  greater   10 The Federal Reserve has had price stability as a formal part of its mandate since 1977."
" In 2012, the 2 percent inflation objective was seen as formalizing judgments  that the Committee had already made over the previous years about the appropriate inflation rate."
 scope to stimulate the economy in times when it judges that achievement of maximum employment requires that the Committee provide policy accommodation.
 From these considerations flows the conclusion that a 2 percent inflation rate is the price -stability objective most consistent with the FOMC’s dual mandate.
 The  2 percent longer -run inflation goal  has been maintained since 2012.
" Policy  Risks  and the Benefits of Credibility  Often, the FOMC  must  balance competing risks  given its dual mandate of promoting maximum employment and  stable prices ."
" In the current context, there is , on the one hand, the risk that monetary  policy will not be sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation back to 2 perc ent over time , and on the other hand there is a risk of policy being too restrictive and unnecessarily increasing the likelihood of recession."
" In the face of this latter risk, s ome economists argue that a higher inflation target is better than the Fed’s c urrent 2 percent target rate .11  Changing the FOMC’s longer -run inflation objective , however, would introduce an additional risk by calling into question the FOMC’s commitment to stabilizing inflation at any level because it might lead people to suspect that the target could be changed opportunistically in the future."
" If so, then these reputational costs will undermine the key benefits of well -anchored longer -run inflation expectations discussed  above:  an increased ability of monetary policy to fight economic downturns without sacrificing price stability."
" Moreover, if the purpose of a higher inflation  11 See, for example, Summers (1991) and Reifschneider and Williams (2000)."
" Blanchard, Dell ’Ariccia , and Mauro (2010), among others, have suggested that central banks should consider raising their target  inflation rate, on the grounds that conditions since the financial crisis have demonstrated that monetary policy is more constrained by the effective lower bound (ELB) on nominal interest rates than was originally estimated."
" F urther , seeking an  inflation rate in the vicinity of 4 percent or higher would certainly stretch the meaning of “stable prices” in the Federal Reserve Act .12  Conclusion  In conclusion, today, I have discussed with you how persistently high inflation hurts everyone and how the Fed must jointly achieve price stability and maximum employment to fulfill its dual mandate ove r time."
" I also discussed  how persistently low inflation is costly, and how changing the 2 percent inflation target would damage the central bank’s credibility."
" For these reasons, I am committed to lowering inflation to our 2 percent target."
"    12 In rejecting a 4 percent inflation target, Bernanke (2010a) suggests that “inflation would be higher and probably more volatile under such a policy” and “inflation expectations would also likely become significantly less stable.”  According to Bernanke  (2010b), “The Federal Reserve over a long period of time has established a great deal of credibility in terms of keeping inflation low, around 2 percent ."
