"  For release on delivery  1:15 p.m. EDT (12:15 p.m. CDT)  September 12, 2016           The “New Normal ” and What I t Means for Monetary Policy   Remarks by   Lael Brainard   Member   Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at  The Chicago Council on Global Affairs   Chicago, Illinois         September 12, 2016     In the months ahead, my colleagues and I will continue  to assess what policy path will best promote the sus tained attainment of our goals."
"Inflation Has Been Undersho oting, and  the Phillips Curve Has Flatte ned First, f or the past several decades, policymakers relied on the empirical relationship between unemployment and inflation embodied in the Phillips curve as a key guidepost for monetary policy."
" The Phillips curve implied that as labor market slack diminished and t he economy approached full employment, upward pressure on inflation  would result ."
" However, since 2012, inflation has tended to change relatively little --both absolutely and relative to earlier decades --as the unemployment rate has fallen                                                  I am grateful to Andrew Figura for his assistance in preparing this text."
"   - 2 - considerably.2  At a time when the unemployment rate has fallen from 8.2 percent to 4.9 percent, inflation has undershot our 2 percent target now for 51 straight months.3  In other words, the Phillips curve appears to be flatter  today than it was previously."
"  With the Phi llips curve appearing to be a less reliable guide post than it has been in the past , the anchoring role of inflation expectations remains critically important."
" On expected similar to  realized inflation , recent developments suggest  some  reasons to be concer ned more about undershooting than overshooting."
" Although some survey measures have remained well anchored at 2 percent, consumer surveys have moved to the lower end of their historical range s and have not risen sustainably.4  Meanwhile, market -based measu res of inflation compensation have declined noticeably ov er the past two years at longer -term horizons, and have shown little improvement despite the recent stabilization in the price of oil and the exchange rate."
" Thus , we cannot rule out that the sustain ed period of und ershooting the inflation target  along with global disinflationary pressures are weighing on inflation expectations."
" The SEP forecasts have shown repeated mark downs of the central tendency of the projection for core PCE (p ersonal consumption expenditures) inflation, and the attainment of 2 percent at the upper end of the range has been pushed out repeatedly from 2012 initially to 2017 most recently."
"                                                   2 See Blanchard (2016), Kiley (2015 b), and Brainard ( 2015 a),  3 The inflation information r efers to core PCE (personal consumption expenditures) inflation measured on a 12month average basis."
" 4 For example, over the past 12  months, median 5 -to10 year -ahead inflation expectations from the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers were 1/4 percentage point below the  average over the prior 10 years."
   - 3 - The apparent flatness of the Phillips curve together with evidence that inflation expectations may have softened on the downside and the persistent undershooting of inflation relative to our target should be important consideration s in our policy deliberations.
" In particular,  to the extent that  the effect on inflation of further gradual tightening in labor market conditions is likely to be modera te and gradual , the case to tighten policy preemptively is less compelling."
"Labor Market Slack Has Been Greater than Anticipated  Second, and related, although we have seen important progress on employment, this improvement has been accompanied by  evidence of greater slack than previously anticipated."
"  Indeed, with payroll employment growth averaging 180,000 per month this year, many observers would have expected the unemployment rate to drop noticeab ly rather than moving sideways , as it has done."
 It is true that today’s  unemployment rate  of 4.9 percent is only 0.1 percentage point from the median SEP participant’s estimate of the longer -run level of unemployme nt.
" However, the natural rate of unemployment  is uncertain and can vary over time."
" Indeed , in the SEP,  the central tendency of the projection for the longer -run natural rate of unemployment has come down significantly , from a range of 5.2 to 6.0 percent  in June 2012 to 4.7  to 5.0 percent in June 2016 --a reduction of 1/2 to 1 percentage point.5  We cannot rule out that estimates of the natural unemployment rate may move even lower ."
"     - 4 - In addition , the unemployment rate is not the only gauge of labor market slack, and other measures have been suggesting there is some room to go ."
"  While it is possible that the current lo w level  of prime -age participation  reflects ongoing pre -crisis trends, we cannot rule out  that it reflects a lagged and still incomplete response to a very slow recovery in job opportunities and wages.6   This possibility is reinforced by  the continued  muted recovery in wage growth."
" Although wage gr owth has picked up to about a 2 -1/2 percent pace in recent quarters, this pace is  only modestly above th at which  prevailed over much of the recovery and well below growth rates seen prior to the financial cr isis.7 My main point here is that in the presence of uncertainty and the absence of accelerating inflationary pressures, it would be unwis e for policy to foreclose on the possibility of making further gains in the labor market ."
" From the fourth quarter of 2003 to the fourth quarter of 2007, the compensation per hour and employment cost index measures increased at an average annual rate of around 3 -1/2 percent."
"Foreign Markets Matter, Esp ecially because Financial Transmission is Strong  Third, d isinflation pressure and weak demand from abroad will likely weigh on the U.S. outlook for some time, and fragility in global markets could again  pose risks here at home.8  In Europe, recovery contin ues, but growth is slow and inflation is very low."
" Low growth and a flat yield curve are contributing to reduced profitability and a higher cost of equity financing for banks, wh ich in turn could impair bank le nding, one of the main transmission channels of monetary policy  in the euro area’s bank -centric financial system ."
" A low growth, low inflation environment also makes progress on fiscal sustainability difficult and leaves countries with high debt -togross domestic product (GDP ) ratios vulnerable to ad verse demand shocks."
Japan remains greatly challenged by weak growth and low inflation.
" Indeed, it is striking that despite active and creative monetary policies in both the euro area and Japan, inflation remains below target levels."
" The experiences of these economies highlight the risk of becoming trapped in a  lowgrowth, low -inflation, low -inflation -expe ctations environment and suggest that policy should be oriented to ward  minimizing the risk of the U.S. economy slipping into such a situation."
                                                   8 The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has repeatedly marked down its forecast of world economic growth in recent y ears.
" From April 2014 to July of this year, for example, the IMF revised down 2015 growth from 3.9 percent to 3 .1 percent."
" And f rom April 2015 to July of this year, the IMF revised down 2016 growth from 3.8 percent to 3.1 percent."
"  - 6 - Downside risks are also present in emerging market economies, where growth has slowed rapidly in recent years.9  Most importantly, China is undergoing a challenging transition from a growth model based on investment , exports, and debt -fueled state -owned enterprises to one driven by consumption, services, and dynamic private businesses."
" Because of the adjustment co sts along this transition path and demographic trends, Chinese growth will likely continue to slow."
" Given that China has experienced very high growth in corporate debt, this downshift could pose risks."
 The importance of Chinese growth and stability to many emerging market  economie s and to global markets more broadly impl ies that these risks have global implications.
" Indeed, recent research suggests that  changes in expectations regarding the path of policy in the United States relative to other major economies lead to exchange rate movements that appear to  be several  times bigger than they were several  years  ago.10  The fact that many advanced economies ar e suffering from deficient demand and have policy rates at or near the zero bound and that the U.S.                                                  9 Emerging market growth , as weighted by a country’s share of U.S. exports,  has decreased from an average pace of 5 -1/4 percent fro m the fourth quarter of 2009 to the fourth quarter of 2012 to a little over 2 percent last year."
"   - 7 - dollar is a favored safe -haven asset may imply that adverse foreign demand shocks have a particularly strong effect on the value of the dollar, effectively transmitting the weakness to the U.S. economy.11   In turn, U.S. activity and inflation appear to be importantly influenced by these exchange rate movements."
economic activity roughly equivalent to a 200 basis point increase in the federal funds rate.
"  Interestingly, it appears that this  effect showed through in decrea sed busine ss investment activity and stagnant manufacturing output, while the anticipated effect on net exports may have been somewhat dampened by depressed demand for imports of capital goods , among other factors ."
"The Neutral Rate Is L ikely to Remain Very Low for Some Time  Fourth, p erhaps most salient for monetary policy, it appears increasingly clear that the neutral rate of interest remains considerably and persistently lower than it was before the crisis."
" Over the current expansion , with a federal funds rate at, or near, zero and the additional support provided by asset purchases and reinvestment, GDP growth ha s averaged a very modest rate  upward of  2 percent, and inflation has averaged only  11/2 percent ."
" Ten years ago, based on t he underlying economic relationships that prevailed  at the time, it would have seemed inconceivable that real activity and inflation would be so subdued given the stance of monetary policy."
  - 8 - amount of aggregate demand associated with a given level of the interest rate  is now much lower than before  the crisis.
"   In the early stages of the recovery, most observers thought that the cyclical headwinds restraining demand and lowering the neutral rate would dissipate, and that the neutral rate would move gradually back to the pre -crisis norm of 2 percent."
" Indeed, developments over the p ast year confirm that the underlying causes will be with us for some time.12  Foreign con sumption and investment are weak, while foreign demand for savings is high, along with an elevated demand for safe assets."
" Productivity growth, which increased at an average annual rate of nearly 21/2 percent from 1950 to 2000 , has increased  only 1/2 per cent on average  over the past five years, and demographics also suggest a persistent slowing of the labor force."
 It is not able that this recent step -down in the SEP estimate has coincided with a period of easing in financial conditions and a stabilization in the exchange rate as market participants have taken into account change s in the perceived FOMC policy reaction function.
Policy Options A re Asymmetric   The four features just discussed that define the new normal make it likely that we will con tinue to grapple with a fifth new reality for some time:  the ability of monetary policy  to respond to shocks  is asymmetric .
" Conventional changes in the federal funds rate, our most tested and be st understood tool, cannot be used as readily to respond to downside shocks to aggregate demand as it can to upside shocks."
"   - 10 - Because a persistently low neutral rate implies less room for conventional monetary policy to adjust to adverse developments , it will be  important to assess whether our current policy tools are adequat e to respond to negative s hocks  and, if not, what adjustments would be most appropriate."
" There is a growing literature on  such policy alternatives , such as raising the inflation target, moving to a nominal income target , or deploying negative interest rates.15  These options merit further assessment."
" For the time  being, the most effective way to address these concerns is to ensure that our policy actions align with  our commitment to achieving the ex isting inflation target, which the Committee has recently clarified is symmetric around 2 percent --and not a ceiling --along with maximum employment."
"  Overall, the recent data on the labor market and aggregate spending suggest that we are continuing to move  toward full employment, but that progress has been, and likely will be, somewha t gradual."
" Th e slowing  pace of job gains has been associated with a flattening out in the unemployment rate over the past year, along with  a heartening  1/2 percentage point  increase  in the prime -age labor force participation rate."
" Th ese developments  suggest that an improving job market has made joining, or remaining in, the labor force increasingly attractive, and may imply  that the labor market  has room for further improvement ."
  Recent spending da ta sugge st a pickup in third -quarter growth.
" In particular , real consumer spending  increased at nearly a 4 percent annual pace over the three months ending in July, driven by continued job growth, buoyant consumer sentiment, and rising household wealth."
" Weak foreign growth and the net appreciation of the dollar over the past two years have weighed heavily on net exports, corporate profitability, business investment, and manufacturing producti on."
" As a result, economic activity over the past three quarters has been disappointing , with growth in GDP and gross domestic income each averaging less than 1 percent, a signific ant step -down from the same period in 2015."
"  Looking ahead, the stabilization of the dollar and oil prices suggest s that growth in these components should move higher over the second half of the year."
  We have also seen signs of progress on our inflation mandate.
 The stabilization of the dollar and oil prices should lead inflation to move back toward our target in coming quarters.
 Continued progress in inflation will also depend on inflation expectations remaining well anchored and not drifting lower.
"  Policy Implications   The five feature s of the current economic landscape  that I  have highlighted  lean roughly  in the same direction :  In today’s new normal , the costs to the economy of greater -thanexpected  strength in demand  are likely to be  lower than the costs of significant unexpected weakness ."
" Moreover, because of Phillips curve  flattening , the possibility  of remaining  labor market slack , the likely substantial response of the exchange rate and its depressing effect on inflation , the low neutral rate , and the fact that  inflation expectations are well ancho red to the upside , the response of inflation to unexpected strength in demand will likely be modest and gradual, requiring  a correspondingly moderate policy response and implying  relatively slight costs to the economy."
" The expe rience of the Japanese and euro -area economies suggest that prolonged weakness in demand is very difficult to correct, leading to economi c costs that can be considerable ."
" I believe this approach has served us well  in recent months , help ing to support continued gains i n employment and progress on inflation ."
