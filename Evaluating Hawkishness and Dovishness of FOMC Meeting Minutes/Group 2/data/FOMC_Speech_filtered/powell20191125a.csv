"Powell  Chair Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System  at Annual Meeting of the Greater Providence Chamber of  Commerce Providence, Rhode Island November 25, 2019 Over the past year, my colleagues and I on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) have been conducting a firstever public review of how we make monetary policy."
" As part of that review, we held Fed Listens events around the country where representatives from a wide range of groups have been telling us how the economy is working for them and the people they represent and how the Federal Reserve might better promote the goals Congress has set for us:  maximum employment and price stability."
" But the wealth of middle -income families —savings, home equity, and other assets—has only recently surpassed levels seen before the Great Recession, and the wealth of people with lower incomes, while growing, has yet to fully recover.1  Fortunately, the outlook for further progress is good:  F orecasters are generally predicting continued growth, a strong job market, and inflation near 2 percent."
 -2 - this expansion:  maintaining a stable and reliable pace of 2 percent inflation and spreading the benef its of employment more widely.
"  Monetary Policy and the Economy in 2019 We started 2019 with a favorable outlook, and over the year the outlook has changed only modestly in the eyes of many forecasters (figure 1)."
" For example, in the Survey of Professional Forecasters, the forecast for inflation  is a bit lower , but the unemployment forecast is unchanged and the forecast for gross domestic product (GDP) is nearly unchanged.2  The key to the ongoing favorable outlook is household spending, which represents about 70 percent of the economy and continues to be strong, supported by the healthy job market, rising incomes, and solid consumer confidence."
 I will describe how we grappled with incoming information and made important monetary policy changes through the year to help keep the favorable outlook on track.
"  As the year began, growth appeared robust, but the economy faced some risks flowing mainly from weakening global economic growth and trade developments."
" Foreign growth, which slipped in the second half of last year, slid further as 2019 progressed."
" While w eaker foreign growth does not necessarily translate into similar weakness here , it does hurt our exporters and presents a risk that the weakness may spread  more broadly."
 These global developments have been holding back overall economic growth.
"  In addition, inflation pressures proved unexpectedly muted this year."
" After remaining  close to our  symmetric 2 p ercent obj ective for  much of last year, inflation is now running below 2 percent."
 Some of the softness in overall inflati on is the result of a fall in oil prices and should not affect inflation going forward.
 But core inflation—which omits volatile food and energy prices—i s also running somewhat below 2 percent.
"  The main t hemes of our deliberations this year have been a continuing favorable outlook founded on strength in the household sector, with a few yellow flags including muted inflation and w eakness in manufacturing."
" In additi on, global growth and trade have present ed ongoing risks and uncertainties."
" While this news did not dramatically alter our outlook, it pointed to an economy with somewhat less m omentum than we had thought.3   3 The Fed’s real -time assessment of job growth this year is discussed in Jerome H."
"Powell (2019), “ Data -Dependent Monetary Policy in an Evolving Economy,” speech delivered at “Trucks and Terabytes:  Integrating the ‘Old’ and ‘New’ Economies,” the 61st Annua l Meeting of the National Association for Business Economics, Denver, Colorado, October 8,  https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20191008a.htm ."
" As you know, we set our policy interest rate to achieve our goals of maximum employment and stable prices."
 One of these is the interest rate that would be neutral—neither restraining the e conomy nor pushing it upward.
" A policy rate above r * would tend to restrain economic activity, while a setting below r * would tend to speed up the economy."
" A second benchmark is the natural rate of unemployment, which is the lowest rate of unemployment that would not create upward pressure on inflation."
" S ince the end of last year, incoming data —especially muted inflation data —prompted analysts inside and outside the Fed to again  revise down their estimates of r* and u*.4  Taken at face value, a lower r* would suggest that monetary policy is providing somewhat less support for employment and inflation tha n previously believed, and the fall in u* would suggest that the labor market was less tight than believed.5  Both could help explain the weakness in                                                  4 Averagi ng across the estimates in figure 2, the estimates of r* are down 0.3 percentage point and those of u* are down 0.2 percentage point."
" For example, using the Taylor (1993) rule and using Okun’s law to state the rule in terms of the unemployment gap with a coefficient of 1 instead of the output gap with a coefficient of 0.5 , the shift in r* and u* would call for a 50  basis po int reduction in the federal funds rate."
  - 5 - inflation.
" To help keep the U.S. economy strong in the face of global developments and to provide some insurance against ongoing risks, we progressively eased the stance of monetary policy over t he course of the year."
" First, we signaled that increases in our short -term interest rate were unlikely."
" The full effects of these monetary policy actions will be felt over time, but we believe they are already helping to support consumer and business  sentiment and boosting spending in interest -sensitive sectors, such as housing  and  consumer durable  goods ."
"We see the current stance of monetary poli cy as likely to remain appropriate as long as incoming information about the economy remains broadly consistent with our outlook of moderate economic growth, a strong labor market , and inflation near our symmetric 2 percent objective."
"  - 6 - A Sustained Return of Inflation to 2 percent  For many years as the economy recovered from t he Great Recession, inflation averaged around 1.5 percent —below our 2 percent objective ( figure 3)."
" We had long expected that inflation would gradually rise as the expansion continued, and, as I noted, both overall and core inflation ran at rates consiste nt with our goal for much of 2018."
" But this year, inflation is again running below 2 percent."
  It is reasonable to ask why inflation running somewhat  below 2 percent is a big deal.
 We have heard a lot about inflation at our Fed Listens events.
" People are concerned about the rising cost of medical care, of housing, and of college, but nobody seems to be complaining about overall inflation running below 2 percent."
  Even central bankers are not concerned about any particular minor fluctua tion in inflation.
"  Around the world, however, we have seen that inflation running persistently below target  can lead to an unhealthy dynamic in which inflation expectations drift down, pulling actual inflation further down."
" Lower inflation can, in turn, pull interest rates to everlower levels."
 That  is why it is  essential that we at the Fed use our tools to make sure that we do not permit an unhealthy downward drift in inflation expectations  and inflation.
" W e are strongly committed to symmetrically and sustainably achieving our 2 percent inflation objective so that in making longterm plans, households and businesses can reasonably expect 2 percent inflation over time ."
 - 7 - Spreading the Benefits of Employment  Many people at our Fed Listens events have told us that this long expansion is  now benefiting low - and middle -income communities to a degree that has not been felt for many years.
" We have heard about companies, communities, and schools working together to help employees build skills —and of employers working creatively to structure jobs so that employees can do their jobs while coping with the demands of family and life beyond the workplace."
 These stories show clearly in the job market data.
 Employment gains have been broad based across all racial and ethnic groups and all levels of educational attainment as well as among people with disabilities (figure 4).
" Fortunately, in the strong job market since 2014, prime -age participation has been staging a comeback."
" Income growth of low - and middle -income households has shown a pattern similar to that of p articipation, with two decades of disappointing news turning to better news during the past few years."
" According to Census data, inflationadjusted incomes for the lowest 20 percent of households declined slightly over the two decades through 2014, and income for the middle 20 percent rose only modestly."
" Since then, incomes for these groups have risen more rapidly, as wage growth has picked up—and picked up most for the lower -paying jobs ( figure 7)."
 The Fed can play a ro le in this effort by steadfastly pursuing our goals of maximum employment and price stability.
" T he research literature suggests a variety of policies , beyond the scope of monetary policy, that could spur further progress by better preparing people to meet  the challenges of technological innovation and global competition and by supporting and rewarding labor force participation.6  These policies could bring immense benefits both to the lives of workers and families directly affected and to the strength of the economy overall."
 - 9 - Conclusion Monetary policy is now well positioned to support a strong labor market and return inflation decisively to our symmetric 2 percent objective.
