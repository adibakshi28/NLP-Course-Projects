" Policy before the Crisis   Prior to the global financial crisis, inflation rates in the United States and other advanced economies were near their target levels and most of these economies appeared to be operating close to their potential."
 Policy interest rates were similarly in the vicinity of levels considered to be normal.
  Fiscal deficits also appeared to be under control before the crisis .
" According to the O rgani sation for E conomic C ooperation and Development  (OECD), general government deficits in 2007 were less than 4 percent of GDP in the U nited S tates and the United K ingdom , about 2 percent in Japan, and less than 1 percent, on average, in the euro area."
" Central banks in the United States and other countries responded by rapidly and sharply reducing their policy interest rates, lowering them in many cases  to near zero ."
 These extraordinary and creative response s showed that monetary policymakers had internalized the lessons of the Great Depression.
" A portion of this  stimulus reflected the operation of automatic stabilizers --higher unemployment benefits, for example, and a decline in tax pay ments  due to lower income s--and some came through cuts in tax rates and increases in discretionary spending ."
" Expansive fiscal policy served to raise deficits in most countries , some of which faced further costs from stabilizing financial institutions , pushing  deficits even higher."
  Sharp increases in deficits led in turn to escalating levels of government debt.
   Policy during the Recovery   The combination of i ncreasing debt and depressed output  led to rising ratios  of debt to gross domestic product (GDP) in many advanced economies and  heightened concern about whether the growth in debt  could be s ustained without unsettling financial   - 3 -  markets.
"  As a result , early in the recovery governments began to withdraw fiscal stimulus , and, in most cases, fiscal policy became a net drag on econom ic growth."
" In Spain, for example, the OECD estimates that fiscal consolidation has subtracted an average of 11/2 percentage poi nts from GDP growth each year  since 2009."
" Governments in both countries embarked on fiscal consolidation programs over the past four years, sharpl y reducing their structural deficits , and , as a consequen ce, creating headwind s that slow ed the recovery."
"  With fiscal drag weighing on growth and with private -sector deleveraging also holding back consumption and investment, monetary policy bore the brunt of supporting the economy ."
" Th ese unconventional tools  have, in my view, served to support a  recovery in domestic demand and, as a consequence, global econom ic growth ."
" But t he lack of fiscal support for demand in recent years also helps    - 4 -  account for the weakness of this  recover y compared with past recoveries .1  In the United States,  fiscal policy has been much  less supportive relative to previous recoveries."
" For instance, at a comparable point in the recovery from the 2001 recession, employment at all levels of government had increased by about 800,000 workers; in contrast, in the current recovery, government employment has declined by about 650,000 jobs."
" When poor economic conditions drive policy inter est rates close to  the zero lower bound, fiscal stimulus may be more effective than usual in boosting aggregate demand because it will not have the usual effect of raising real interest rates , thereby crowding out private demand.2  A second lesson is that,  while even if it is  appropriate for fiscal policy to play a larger role when policy rates are near zero, policymakers nevertheless  may face constraints  in implementing fiscal stimulus ."
" This means that central banks need to be prepared to employ all available tools , including unconventional policies, to support economic growth and to reach their inflation targets ."
"Summers (2012) , “Fiscal Policy in a  Depressed Economy ,” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity , Spring, pp."
"  Looking Ahead  In advanced economies, the current macroeconomic policy mix generally remains one of extraordinary monetary policy stimulus and somewhat contractionary fiscal policy."
" Considering the headwinds that continue to weigh on growth, employment, and prices, this s ituation  is hardly ideal ."
" As employment, economic activity, and inflation rates return to normal, monetary policy will eventually need to normalize too, although the speed and timing of this normalization will likely differ across countries based on differences in the pace of recovery in domestic conditions."
" More importantly, the normalization of monetary policy will be an important sign that economic conditions more generally are finally emerging from the shadow of the Great Recession."
