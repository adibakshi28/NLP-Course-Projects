"  As this year’s theme , “Resilience and Rebuilding ,” reflects, low -income communities were  particularly hard hit by the Great Recession.1  And, while employment and housing show signs of improving for the nation as a whole, conditions in lower -income neighborhoods remain difficult by many measures."
" For example, an analysis by Federal Reserve staff r eveals that long -vacant housing units tend to be concentrated in a small numb er of neighborhoods that also tend to have high unemployment rates, low educational l evels, and low median incomes.2  While some of these neighborhoods are in the inner cities, ot hers are in suburb s."
"  This analysis and others like it illustrate the close interconnections of housing conditions, educational levels, and unemployment experience within neighborhoods."
" These neighborhoods were comparable by many measures :  Both were 99 percent African  American, with similar numbers of elderly residents and comparably high rates of poverty  and unemployment."
 High dropout rates in turn fueled the neighborhood’s high rates of unemployment and crime.
