" Early in my career, I examined the impact of underdevelopment in the Russian banking system  on growth in post -Soviet Russia and the instability that can occur in a poorly regulated financial system."
Achieving the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate of maximum employment and stable prices  depends on a stable financial system.2  We all saw how the Global Financial  1 The views expressed here are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.

" I am watching closely the extent to which post -pandemic supply and demand patterns  4 See the box “Vulnerabilities from Asset Valuations, Risk Appetite, and Low Interest Rates” in Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2021), Financial Stability Report (Washington:  Board of Governors, May), pp."
" Demand in the office sector has remained weak, particularly in central business districts and coastal cities, with vacancy rates increasing further and rent growth declining."
" Such stresses can propagate through the financial system, causing funding shortages that curtail credit and hamper economic activity."
" However, measures of the ability of firms to service their debt remain  strong overall , supported by - 5 -  resilient corporate profits and limited effects to date from  higher interest rates ."
" The pass -through of higher interest rates into debt -servicing costs appear s to be muted by the large share of longterm, fixed -rate liabilities."
" However, I note that for  risky borrowers or those with highyield or unrated debt , the ability to service their debt burdens has started to show signs of weakness, as would be expected in a rising interest  rate environment , and could become further strained if corporate earnings f all due to a sharper -thanexpected slowdown in economic activity."
" When financial  institutions are overly indebted, adverse shocks can cause them to retrench more than they otherwise would, resulting in greater declines in economic activity."
"  The rise in interest rates over the past two years has contributed to robust bank profitability , as banks earned higher interest income on floatingrate loans while interest expense on many deposits remained well below market rates."
" A t the same time, higher longterm interest rates also substantially affected the fair value of banks’ holdings of fixed -rate assets ."
" As we saw earlier this year, fair value losses on bank balance sheets , when combined with poor liquidity and interest rate risk management, can leave banks exposed to additional risk."
" I will cover both domestic and international risks in a way that is closely aligned with the discussion in the FSR .6  In recent outreach, as summarized in this f igure from the FSR , contacts were particularly focused on the persistent inflationary pressures leading to further monetary tightening, the potential for significant losses on CRE and residential real estate, the reemergence of banking -sector stress, and market liquidity strains and volatility."
" Internationally, inflation ary pressures persist  in advanced foreign economies and could pose risks to the global financial system."
" Higher interest rates, particularly if they persisted, could be a binding constraint on the debt -servicing capacity of foreign households, businesses, and governments."
" In China, a further slowdown in economic growth could worsen financial stresses."
" Given the size of its economy and financial system, financial stress in China could be propagated to global markets more broadly through disruptions to economic activity, deterioration of risk sentiment, and a sharp appreciation of the dollar."
" More broadly, e scalation of geopolitical tensions could lead to lower economic activity and increased fragmentation of global trade flows and financial intermediatio n, raising financing and production costs and contributing to more sustained supply chain challenges and inflationary pressures."
