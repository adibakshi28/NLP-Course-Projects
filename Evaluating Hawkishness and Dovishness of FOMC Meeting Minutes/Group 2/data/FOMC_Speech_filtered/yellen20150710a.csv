 Next week I  will deliver the Fed eral Reserve’s semiannual r eport on monetary policy  and answer  questions from members of Congress  at public hearings of the House and the Senate.
 We also do so because we can more effectively achiev e our mandated goals --maximum employment and price s tability --as well as  help maintain stability in the financial system if people understand what we are  doing and why.
" U.S. e conomic output --as measured by inflation -adjusted gross domestic product , or real GDP --fell more than 4  percent  from the  end of 2007 to the middle of 2009."
" The unemployment rate peaked at 10  percent  nationally, and it reached 11  percent here in Ohio."
" Over that same period, Ohio lost more than  400,000 jobs, or 71/2 percent of the state’s employment."
"In resp onse to the  financial crisis , the severe recession , and the risk that inflation would fall persistently far below levels consistent with price stability , we at the Federal Reserve took forceful  actions ."
" The FOMC  aggressively cut our short -term interest rate target , the federal funds rate, from above 5 percent to near zero  by the end of 2008 to lower borrowing costs and help spur household spending and business investment ."
" With short -term interest rates  near zero , the FOMC provided further support to the economy through our large -scale asset purchases --buying large amounts  of Treasury and mortgage -related secu rities  in the open market ."
" During the economic recovery, we put additional downward pressure on longer -term borrowing  rates by explaining publicly that we intended to keep short -term interest rates low for a long time ."
" Although evidence suggests that our policy actions  were effective, the pace of the economic recovery  has been slow.1  Growth in real GDP has averaged only about                                                  1 A number of studies have found that the Federal Reserve’s asset purchases put downward pressure on longterm interest rates."
" In the labor market , the U.S.  unemployment  rate st ood at 5.3 percent  in June , around half as high as its peak after the recession and close to many  economists’  assessment of its longer -run natural rate--the level that can be sustained without risking excessive inflation ."
" Ohio ’s unemployment rate has declined  even  more during the recovery  than the nation as a whole , and  at 5.2 percent in May , it was somewhat below the U.S. average  in that month ."
" Nevertheless , although nonfarm payroll s in Ohio have  increased by around 400,000 jobs since the low point  for the state’s employment, payrolls have yet to surpass  their leve l just prior to the recession ."
" Partly as a result, U.S. m anufacturing employment fell  21/4 million  during 2008 and 2009, a significantly large r percentage decline than occurred in overall employment."
" And while manufacturing employment                                                  English, David López -Salido, and Edward Nelson (2012), “The Federal Reserve’s Large -Scale Asset Purchase Programs:  Rati onale and Effects,” Economic Journal, vol."
" Moreover, the Federal Reserve’s forward guidance and asset purchase policies have been estimated to have helped lower unemployment and boost inflatio n; see Eric M."
" A similar trend has also been seen in Ohio, where manufacturing jobs have shrunk from about 25 percent of  the state’s private -sector employment in 1990 to  about 15 percent  now ."
" So, some of the decline  in manufacturing jobs since the recession reflects the longer -term structural downtrend of employment in this sector."
"  Current Conditions in t he Labor Market  As I noted, the  national  unemployment rate has declined  markedly  during the economic recovery."
" B ut it is my judgment that the  lower level of the  unemployment rate today probably does not fully capture the  extent of slack  remaining  in the labor market --in other words, how far away we are from a full -employment economy ."
" It continued to decline substantially after  the recession  ended , with the pace of those declines slowing only over the past year  or so  even as the unemployment rate  has continued to fall."
"  Even in a stronger job market , it is likely that many of these individuals would prefer not to work."
"                                                   2 See Stephanie Aaronson, Tomaz Cajner, Bruce Fallick, Felix Galbis -Reig, Christopher Smith, and William Wascher (2014), “Labor Force Participation:  Recent Developmen ts and Future Prospects,” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, Fall, pp."
" Some portion of the greater share of  work ers who are part time for economic reasons  may reflect structural rather than cyclical factors.3  For example, the ongoing shift in employment away from manufacturing  and toward services, a sector which historically relied more heavily on part -time workers, may be boosting the share of part -time jobs."
" Despite these structural trends, which make it difficult to know  where the share of those employed pa rt time for economic reasons may settle in the long er run, I continue to think that it probably remains higher  than it would be in a full -employment economy ."
" H ere too, however, the  signal is not entirely clear, as other factors such as longer -run trends in productivity growth also generally influence the growth of compensation."
" More recently, however, some tentative hints  of a pickup in the pace of wage gains  may  indicate that the objective of full employment is coming closer into view ."
"  Recent Inflation  Developments  While the labor market has moved c loser to the FOMC’s mandated goal of maximum employment, less  progress  has been made in moving inflation close to the FOMC’s longer -run objective of 2 percent , which the Committee  consider s to be consistent with our mandated goal of price stability."
" Price inflation excluding  the volatile categories of energy  and food prices , or socalled core inflation , is often a better indicator of future o verall inflation ."
" The stronger dollar has pushed down the prices of imported goods, and that, in turn, has put downward pressure on core inflation."
" In addition, the plunge in oil prices may have had some indirect effects in holding dow n the prices of nonenergy items in core inflation, as producers passed on to their customers some of the cost savings from lower energy prices."
" In all, however, these downward pressures seem to be abating, and the effects of these transitory factors are expected to fall out of measures  of inflation by early next year."
  Very low inflation may not sound like a real problem to many people.
" However, persistently  low price inflation, which can tend to slow the pace of wage  increases over time, can weaken  the economy  by, for example, making it more difficult for households and firms to pay off their debts."
" A persistent, very  low inflation environment also tends to result in chronically low short -term interest rates."
"  This type of situation would leave less scope for  the FOMC  to respond with its conventional monetary policy tool --namely , a cut in the federal funds  rate--to counteract a weakening in the economy."
" In particular, t he higher foreign exchange value of the dollar  that I mentioned , as well as weak growth in some foreign economies , has restrained the demand for U.S. exports ."
" We expect t he drag on domestic e conomic activity from these factors to ease over the course of this year,  as the value of the dollar and crude oil prices  stabilize , and I antici pate moderate economic growth , on balance, for this year as a whole."
" Looking  further  ahead, I think that many of the fundamental  factors underlying U.S. economic activity are solid and should lead to some pickup in the pace of economic                                                  4 See Charles E."

   - 10 - growth in the coming years.
" In particular, I anticipate that employment will continue to expand and the unemployment rate will decline  further ."
"  An improving job market should, in turn, help support a faster pa ce of household spending growth."
" In addition, growing employment and wages should make consumers more comfortable in spending a greater portion of their incomes  than they have been in the aftermath of the  Great Recession ."
 Another positive factor for the outlook is that  the drag on economic growth in recent years from changes in federal fiscal policies  appears to have waned .
" Temporary  fiscal stimulus  measures  supported economic output  during the recession and earl y in the recovery , but those  stimulus  measures  have since expired , and  additional policy actions  were taken to reduce the  federal budget deficit ."
" By 2011, these changes in  fiscal polic ies were holding back economic  growth ."
" Howeve r, the effects of those fiscal policy actions  now seem to be mostly behind us.5                                                   5 The C ongressional Budget Office estimates that current federal fiscal policies will have little effect on economic growth this year, but that earlier fiscal policy actions reduced the rate of real GDP growth roughly 1 -1/2 percentage points in 2013 and about 1/4 percentage point in 2014 relative to what it would  - 11 - There are a couple of  factors , however, that I e xpect could restrain economic growth ."
" Indeed, s ome economic analysi s sugge sts that uncertainty about the strength of the recovery and about  government economic policies  could be contributing to the restraint in business investment .6 A second  factor that could restrain economic growth regards housing."
" Many households still find it difficult to obtain mortgage credit, but , more generally, the weak job market and slow wage gains in recen t years appear to have induced people to double -up on housing ."
" Population growth is creating a need for more housing, whether to rent or to own, and I do expect that continuing job and w age gains will encourage  more people to form new  households ."
"  Regarding inflation, as  I mentioned earlier,  the recent  effects of lower prices for crude  oil a nd for imports  on overall inflation are expected to wane during this year ."
" Combined with further tightening in labor  and product  market s, I expect inflation will move toward  the FOMC’s  2 percent  objective  over  the next few years."
 - 12 - number of differ ent surveys  indicate  that longer -term inflation expectations  have remained stable even as recent  reading s on inflation have fallen.
"  If inflation expectations had not remained stable, I would be more concerned because consumer and business expectations abo ut inflation can be come self -fulfilling."
   Implications for Monetary Policy  My own outlook for the economy  and inflation is broadly consistent with the central tendency of the projections submitted by FOMC participants  at the time of our June meeting .
" Based on my  outlook, I expect that it will be  appropriate at some point later this year to take the first step to  raise the federal funds rate and  thus  begin normalizing monetary policy."
" But I want to emphasize  that the course of the economy  and inflation remains  highly uncertain, and unanticipated  developments could delay or accelerate this  first step."
" We  will be watching carefully to see if there is continued improvement in l abor market  conditions, and we  will need to be reasonably confident that inflation will move back to 2 percent in the next few years ."
" Because there are some  factors, which I mentioned earlier, that continue to restrain the economic expansion, I currently anticipate that the  appropriate pace of normalization will be gradual , and  that monetary policy will need to be highly supportive of economic activity  for quite some time."
" But , again , both the course of the economy and inflation are uncertain."
" If progress toward our employment and inflation goals is  - 13 - more rapid than expected, it may be appropriate to remove  monetary policy  accommodation  more quickly."
"  LongRun Economic Growth   Before I conclude, let me very briefly place my discussion of the economic outlook into a longer -term context."
 The Federal Reserve contributes to the nation’s econom ic performance  in part by using monetary policy to help achieve our mandated goals of maximum employment and price stability.
" But success in promoting these objectives  does  not, by itself , ensure a strong pace of long -run economic growth or substantial  improvement s in future  living standards."
" The most important factor determining  continued advances  in living standards is productivity growth, defined as the rate of increase in how much a worker  can produce in an hour of work."
 The growth rate of output per hour worked in the business sector has averaged about 1 -1/4 percent per year since the recession began in late 2007 and has  been essentially flat over the past year .
" In contrast, annual productivity gains averag ed 23/4 percent over the decade  preceding the Great Recession ."
" I mentioned earlier the sluggish pace of wage gains in recent years, and while I do t hink that this i s evidence of some persisting labor market  slack , it also may reflect, at least in part, fair ly weak productivity growth."
 There are many unanswered questions about what has slowed productivity growth in recent years and about the prospects for productivity  growth in the longer run.
" But we do know that productivity ultimately depends on many factors, including our workforce’s  - 14 - knowledge and skills a long with the quantity and quality of the capital  equipment , technology, and infrastructure that they have to w ork with."
" A s a general principle , the American people would be well served by  the active  pursui t of effective policies to support longer -run growth in productivity."
