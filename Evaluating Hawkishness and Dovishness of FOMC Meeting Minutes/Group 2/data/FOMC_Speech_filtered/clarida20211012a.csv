"For release on delivery  11:15 a.m. EDT  October  12, 20 21         U.S. Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy     Remarks by   Richard H."
"Clarida   Vice Chair   Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at the  2021 Institute of I nternational Finance Annual Membership Meeting:  Sustainable Economic Growth and Financial Stability in a  Diverging, Decarbonizing, Digitizing, Indebted World  Washington, D.C.  (via webcast)        October  12, 20 21   It is my pleasure to meet virtually  with you today at the 2021  Institute of International Finance Annual Membership Meeting.1  I regret that we are not meeting in person,  but I look forward , as always , to a conversation with my good friend and one -time colleague Tim  Adams ."
" But f irst, please allow  me to offer a few remarks on the economic outlook and Federal Reserve monetary policy."
 Current Economic Situation and Outlook  Indicators of economic activity and employment reveal that  the economy continue s to strengthen.
" Real gross domestic product ( GDP ) rose at a strong 6.4 percent pace in the first half of the year, and growth is widely expected to continue at a robust , if perhaps somewhat slower , pace in the second half  of the year ."
" If so, GDP growth  this calendar year  could be the fastest since 1983."
"  That said, the data also indicate that  a surge in COVID19 cases in the summer and supplychain bottlenecks held back economic activity i n the third quarter ."
"As with overall economic activity, conditions in the labor market have continued to improve."
" Labor market progress this year, as measured by the Kansa s City Fed’s Labor Market Conditions Indicators , has been notable, with this index of 24 labor market indicators since December 2020 closing twothirds of its shortfall relative to its  prepandemic level.2  Nonetheless, f actors related to the pandemic, su ch as caregiving obligations  and ongoing fears of the virus, continue to  weigh on employment   1 The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of other Federal Reserve Board members or Federal Open Market Committee participants."
" Since February 2020, core  PCE (personal consumption expenditure s) price inflation is running at a 2.9 percent  annual pace that is well above what I would consider to be a moderate overshoot of our 2 percent longer -run goal  for inflation."
" In particular, the reopening has been  characterized by significant sectoral shifts in both aggregate demand and supply,  and these shifts are causing widespread bottlenecks and triggering substantial changes in the relative price and wage structure of the economy."
" As these relativ e price adjustments work their way through the economy, measured inflation rises."
 But I continue to believe that the underlying rate inflation in the U .S.
"  That said, I believe,  as do most of my colleagues, that the risks to inflation are to the upside, and I continue to be attuned and attentive to underlying inflation trends , in particular measures of inflation  expectations, including the Board staff’s index of c ommon inflation expectations.3  As Chair Powell has indicated,  if we did see indicators of inflation expectations moving up and running persistently above  3 The Fed staff’s index of common inflation expectations —which is now updated quarterly on the Board’s website —is a relevant indicator that this goal is being met."
"  - 3 - levels consistent with our price stability mandate, monetary policy would  react to that."
" Since our December 2020 meeting , the Committee has indicated  that it will continue to maintain the pace of Treasury and mortgage -backed securities  purchases at $80 billion and $40 billion per month, respectively, until “subs tantial further progress” has been made toward our maximum -employment and price -stability goals .4  At our September meeting, the Committee continued to discuss the progress made toward these  goals , and I myself believe that the “ substantial  further  progre ss” standard has more than been met with regard to our price -stability mandate and has all but been met with regard to our employment mandate."
" - 4 - As we reaffirmed in September, w e continue to expect that it will be appropriate to maintain the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the  federal funds rate until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessment of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time."
" At least h alf of the 18 FOMC participants  in their Summary of Economic Projections ( SEP) submissions projected that these necessary threshold conditions for liftoff will be met by December 2022, and all participants but 1 project that these conditions will be met by December 2023.5  These projections are entirely consistent with  the new monetary policy framework adopted unanimously by the Committee  in August 2020.6  In the context of our new framework, as I have noted before, while the effective lower bound ( ELB ) can be a constraint on monetary policy, the ELB is n ot a constraint on fiscal policy, and appropriate monetary policy under our new framework, to me, must —and certainly can —incorporate this reality."
" Indeed, under present circumstances, I judge that the s upport to aggregate demand from fiscal policy—including the nearly  $2 trillion in accumulated excess savings accruing from (as yet)  unspent transfer payments —in tandem with appropriate monetary policy, can fully offset the constraint, highlighted in our St atement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, that the ELB imposes on the ability of an inflation -targeting monetary policy, acting on its own and in the absence of sufficient fiscal support, to restore, following a  5 The most recent SEP, released following the conclusion of the September 2021 FOMC meeting, is available on the Board’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm ."
