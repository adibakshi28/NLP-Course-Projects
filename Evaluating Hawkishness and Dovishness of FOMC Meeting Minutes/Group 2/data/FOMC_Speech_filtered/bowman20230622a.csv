economy since the onset of the pandemi c and on the implications of those developments for the FOMC’s  congressionally mandated goals of maximum employment and stable prices.
" After  the initial phases of the pandemic and the lockdowns and forced closures of most businesses, we saw strengthening economic activity accompanied by  unacceptably high and persistent inflation."
" Over the past several years, a s economic activity has continued to normalize, o ne consistent strength has been  the resilienc e of the labor market ."
" Jobs have grown at a solid pace, wages have increased  for many workers , and we’ve seen continued low unemployment."
"economy experienced the most significant inflation in 40 years , reaching a peak of over 9  percent  last year ."
" The FOMC has made progress in lowering inflation, but despite the significant tightening of monetary policy, we continue to see unacceptably high levels of inflation."
"  - 2 -   Recent research has argued that pandemic -related supply and demand factors , in addition to unusually expansionary fiscal policy,  contributed to high inflation ."
"supply chain disruptions and shipping and logistics  challenges drove up prices for a number of goods .2  Many of the supplyside issue s have now abated , and  the FOMC has rapidly increased  the federal funds rate to bring demand into better balance with sup ply."
" Therefore, I believe there is more work to do to bring inflation down."
"  I supported the FOMC’s decision last week  to hold the federal funds rate target range steady and to continue to reduce the Fed’s  securities holdings ; however, I believe that additional policy  rate increases will be necessary to bring inflation down to our target over time."
" Although t ighter monetary policy has had some effe ct on economic activity and inflation  to date , we have seen core inflation essentially plateau since the fall of 2022 , and I expect that we will need to increase the federal funds rate further to achieve a sufficiently restrictive  stance of monetary policy t o meaningfully and durably bring inflation down."
 I will continue to monitor the incoming data and to look for signs that inflation is on a consistent downward path as I consider appropriate monetary policy at future meetings.

 Community development organizations and government can also play a role in enhancing worker skills to meet the demands of a hightech economy and increase the labor supply.
