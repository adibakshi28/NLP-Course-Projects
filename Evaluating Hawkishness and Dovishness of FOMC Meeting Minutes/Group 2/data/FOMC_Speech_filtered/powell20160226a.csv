"Powell   Member   Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at   “2016 U.S. Monetary Policy Forum ” An annual conference sponsored by  University of Chicago Booth School of Business    New York, New York         February 26, 2016    This paper reviews Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) communications from the time the Committee began issuing regular postmeeting statements in 1999 to the present.1  The authors provide an extended and insightful discussion of the theory and practice o f providing forward guidance about monetary policy."
  The authors  show that data -based guidance has desirable characteristics and can make monetary policy more effective.

" The Committee instead adopted thresholds, saying that it did not intend to raise rates at least as long as unemployment remained above 6 ½ percent, inflation one to two years ahead was projected to be no higher than 2 ½ percent, and longer -term inflation expectations remained well anchored.7  The adoption of thresholds was a clear change to databased guidance, as its principal sponsors had frequently urged.8  The point was not                                                    4 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2011), “ FOMC Statement ,” press release, August  9, paragr aph 3, www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20110809a.htm ."
" Engen, Laubach, and Reifschneider (2015) argue that the Federal Reserve’s time -based guidance initiated in August 2011 was highly effective in inducing market participants to change their beli efs about the Committee’s reaction function and to regard  monetary policy  as more accommodative."
" In an August  2011 speech, Chairman Bernanke indicated that the guidance about the federal funds rate path was highly conditional on the outlook, saying, “in what the Committee judges to be the most likely scenarios for resource utilization and inflation in the medium term, the target for the federal funds rate would be held at its current low levels for at least two more years.”  ( Ben S."

"   - 4 - to provide additiona l stimulus at the time of adoption, but rather to allow market participants to adjust their expectations about future monetary policy in response to incoming data --exactly what the authors advocate.9 The Committee also used balance sheet policy through most of this period."
" The                                                    9 The thresholds ’ useful life was fairly short because the unemployment rate fell sharply,  from 8.0  percent  in December 2012 to 6.2 percent  in April 2014, while inflation remained below 2.0 percent ."
" At the September meeting, the FOMC decided to wait to see how global markets and the e conomy evolved, noting in its statement that “R ecent global economic and financial developments may restrain economic activity somewhat and are likely to put further downward pressure on inflation in the near term .”13                                                    12 See Feroli and others, “Language after Liftoff,” in note 1, p."
"  In the statement released after the FOMC’s most recent meeting in January, the Committee said that, in evaluating future adjustments to the target range for the feder al funds rate, it would “assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent                                                    14 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2015), “Federal Reserve Issues FOMC Statement ,” press release, October 28, paragraph 3, www.federalreserve.gov/ newsevents/press/monetary/20151028a.htm ."
   - 7 - inflation.”15  This language shows that the Committee has moved away from the time -based guidance of the c risis years.
" 16 For example, t he January 2016 FOMC s tatement  says, “ The Committee expects that economic conditions will e volve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate;  the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run.”  (Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Syste m (2016), “Federal Reserve Issues FOMC Statement,” press release, January 27, paragraph 4, www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20160127a.htm .)  - 8 - The authors acknowledge that  the distinction between rules and discretion is too simple to capture the problems that monetary policymakers face.17  I would say the same of the distinction between time -based and data -based forward guidance."
" Since the fall of 2007, policymakers have submitted projections in conjunction with four FOMC meetings each year; in 2012, those projections were augmented to include each participant’s path for appropriate monetary policy."
" In 2012, t he Committee first released its statement on Longer -run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, which formalized the FOMC’s 2 percent inflation objective and is reaffirmed each year at the January meeting."
