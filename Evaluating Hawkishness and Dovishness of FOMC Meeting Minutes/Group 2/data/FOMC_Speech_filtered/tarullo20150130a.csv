" For example, in recent tests, the Federal  Reserve has  assessed potential interest rate risk by analyzing how sensitive deposits will be to rate rises, whether banks might have to raise deposit rates more than expected to retain deposits, and whether banks that are hedging interest rate risk are all dealing with the same few counterparties."
" Like the reforms to banking regulation that followed  the crisis, this new form of r egulation might start by strengthening some of the firmor fundspecific measures associated with those traditional regulatory aims, but then move forward to take into account such considerations as system -wide demands on liquidity during stress periods a nd correlated risks among asset managers that could exacerbate liquidity, redemption, and firesale pressures."
" Demand for safe short -term assets is both real and substantial, emanating from multiple sources, including sovereign nations that wish to self -insure against exchange rate pressures; nonfinancial corporations that have increased their cash holdings in the wake of the market disruptions associated with defaults by Enron and other companies; and institutional investors protecting themselves against redemption demands or other unexpected cash needs."

" Indeed, there is some risk that, as regulation makes some forms of such assets more costly, this demand will simply turn elsewhere."
" Thus the ultimate effectiveness of what I have termed prudential market regulation will depend on policymakers taking into account in their regulatory approaches the sources of, and motivation for, demand for short -term, liquid, and relatively safe assets beyond the debt of very creditworthy s overeigns."
"  Many of these members are themselves sy stemically important firms, which will likely be suffering losses and facing liquidity demands of their own in anything but an idiosyncratic stress scenario at a CCP."
" Researchers with a macroprudential perspective can contribute to these discussions with analyses of system -wide liquidity demands and knockon effects of defaults by CCP members, as well as policy suggestions to address vulnerabilities that emerge from these analyses."
