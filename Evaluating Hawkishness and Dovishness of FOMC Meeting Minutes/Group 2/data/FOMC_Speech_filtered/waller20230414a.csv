" I am going to focus my remarks on the economic outlook, including how the recent turmoil in banking has affected that outlook.1  Relative to the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) economic objectives, data for the first quarter indicate that e conom ic output and employment are continuing t o grow at a solid pace while inflation remains much too high."
" The FOMC raised its target range for the federal funds rate to 4¾ to 5 percent at its March meeting , and our statement noted that recent banking developments are likely to result in tighter cre dit conditions and to weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation."
" So, perhaps even more closely than usual, I will be watching the data to evaluate the appropriate pa th of monetary policy."
 The job of the lender of last resort is to provide sufficient funds to the banking system so that depositors can be confident  they will be able to withdraw their funds on demand.
  This success allowed us to focus on our macroeconomic objectives of price stability and maximum employment when setting the policy rate at our March FOMC meeting.
" That said, it is unclear to what extent the stress in the banking system will weigh on economic activity."
" Tighter financial conditions or other lending conditions would likely cause households to reduce spending and businesses to pull back on investment and hiring, all of which will help move supply and demand back into better balance and help bring inflation down toward our 2 percent target."
" In the Board’s  January senior loan officer opinion survey, bank officials reported higher interest rates for loans and tighter lending standards , relative to the end of  last year.2  These loan officers also said they expected to continue tightening lending standards over the course of 2023."
" I say this because, all else equal, a significant tightening of credit conditions could obviate the need for some additional monetary policy tightening, but making such a judgement is difficult, especially in real time.3   Regarding the economic outlook, the data in hand for the first quarter of 2023 continue to surprise me , with stronger growth and job creation tha n I expected late last year."
" The FOMC has significantl y raised the target range for the federal funds rate to dampen aggregate demand, but U.S. consumers  and businesses are showing remarkable resilience."
" The Atlanta Fed’s gross domestic product (GDP) growth tracker, which reflects the most up -todate data, estimate s that gross domestic product grew by 2.2 percent in the first quarte r, in line with many private sector estimates  and higher than most estimates of potential growth provided by FOMC participants."
" This growth would mean that, so far, tighter monetary policy and credit  conditions are not doing much to restrain aggregate demand."
" Just a few minutes ago  data on retail sales for March was relea sed, which will give us some idea of how consumer demand is holding up."
" For this and other sectors of the economy, I believe that demand will moderate because of  higher interest rates."
" The jobs report for March showed, once again, that we have a strong labor market , with 236,000 jobs created and the unemployment rate f alling to 3.5 percent ."
" While still showing strong signs of growth, job creation did cool a bit from the hot readings we got in January and February."
" The job openings data along with the jobs report show that labor demand has been falling , which is more evident i n declining vacancies than in rising  layoffs."
  So as the labor market continues to rebalance this should help bring inflation down by reducing wage pressures.
" Now, let’s talk about what th ese developments  mean for inflation."
" Inflation moderated in the sec ond half of 2022, but that progress more or less stalled toward the end of the year, and inflation remains  far above the FOMC’s target of 2 percent."
" On April 12, we got consumer price index (CPI) inflation data for March, and it was another month of mixed news."
" Overall CPI inflation rose very little with only a 0.05 percent  - 6 - increase from the previous month, due to sharp declines in food and energy prices, with the year over year increase falling to 5 percent."
" Core inflation, which strips out food and energy prices, is a good guide to future inflation, and that measure came in at around 0.4 percent in March, which translates to an annual rate of 4.6 percent if it were to persist."
 It was the fourth month in a row with core inflation at 0.4 percent or highe r.
" Since December of 2021, core inflation has basically moved sideways with no apparent downward movement."
" So, despite some encouraging news on a slowing in housing costs, core inflation does not show much improvement and remains far above our 2 percent inflation target."
" Whether you measure inflation using the CPI or the Fed’s  preferred measure of personal c onsumption e xpenditures , it is still much too high and so my  job is not done."
" I interpret these data as indicating that we haven’t made much progress on our inflation goal, which leaves me at about the same place on the economic outlook that I was at the last FOMC meeting , and on the same path for monetary policy."
" Because financial  conditions have not significantly tightened, the labor market continues to be strong and quite tight, and inflation is far above target, so monetary policy needs to be  tightened further."
" How much further will depend on incoming data on inflation, the rea l economy, and the extent of tightening credit conditions."
"Another implication from my outlook and the slow progress lately is that , as of now, monetary policy will need to remain tight for a substantial period of time , and longer than markets anticipate ."
" I would welcome signs of moderating demand, but until they appear  and I see inflation moving meaningfully and persistently down toward our 2 percent  target , I believe there is still work to do."
