"For release on delivery  1:00 p.m. EST  March 2, 2021          U.S. Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy:  An Update     Remarks by   Lael Brainard   Member   Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at the  C."
 Economic forecasts for growth during the first quarter have been significantly upgraded in response to the better -thanexpected data.2  January data for household spending overall came i n strong—confirm ing that the renewal of fiscal support at the end of the year provided a much  needed boost to household incomes and spending at the turn  of the year.
" 2 See, for example, the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s GDP Now, which revised up the estimate for firstquarter growth by 5 percentage points on the release of the retail sales data ."
" When we take into consideration the more than 4 million workers who have left the labor force since the pandemic started, as well as misclassification errors, the unemploy ment rate is close to 10 percent currently —much higher than the headline unemployment rate of 6.3 percent."

" - 3 - participation rate for prime ‑age women could have  scarring effects, with  longer -term implications for household incomes and potenti al growth.6   Roughly 90 percent of the shortfall in private payroll employment relative to the preCOVID level is concentrated in serviceproviding industries, with half of these service job losses in leisure and hospitality."
 Workers in the lowest -wage quartile face an extremely elevated  rate of unemployment of around 23 percent .7  The advent of widespread vaccinations should revive inperson schooling and childcare  along with demand for the inperson services that employ a significant fraction of the lower -wage workforce .
"  Realized inflation  remains low, although inflation expectations appear to have moved closer to our 2 percent longer -run target ."
" Both core and headline measures of 12month personal consumption expenditures ( PCE) inflation were 1.5 percent in January, well below our longer -run 2 percent inflation goal."
" Longer -term inflation expectations appear to have moved up in recent months , consistent with the Federal Open Market Committee’s ( FOMC ) new commitment to achieving inflation that averages 2 percent over time."
" Market -based indicators of inflation expectations increased over recent months, with T reasury Inflation -Protected Securitie sbased measures of inflation compensation over the next 5 years and 10 years rising about 40 and 30 basis points ,  6 See Olivia Lofton, Nicolas Petrosky -Nadeau, and Lily Seitelman (2021),  “Parents in a Pand emic Labor Market ,” Working Paper 202104 (San Francisco:  Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco,  February),  https://www.frbsf.org/economic -research/publications/workingpapers/2021/04;  and Lael Brainard (2020) , “Achieving a Broad -Based and Inclusive Recovery ,” speech delivered at “ PostCOVID—Policy Challenges for the Global Economy, ” Society of Professional Economists Annual Online Conference, October 21, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/brainard20201021a.htm ."
"7 For more information on the  analysis  on employment by wage quartile , see the box “Disparities in Job Loss during the Pandemic ” in Board of Governors, Monetary Policy Report , in note 5."
" Some survey measures of inflation expectations have also moved up in recent months, although, on balance, they have only moved up toward their pre -COVID levels."
"  In many foreign countries , growth moderated at the end of 2020, as a  spike in COVID hospitalizations and deaths led to tighter public health restrictions in many economies."
" It should also be aided by some rundown in the stock of excess savings, continued fiscal and monetary support, and st rong U.S. demand."
"  The turnaround in growth  in each country will hinge on success in controlling the virus and limiting economic scarring from the past year’s downturn , as well as on available policy space, and underlying macroeconomic vulnerabilities."
" Increasing vaccinations, along with enacted and expected fiscal measures  and accommodative monetary policy,  point to a strong modal outlook for 2021, although considerable uncertainty rem ains."
  Inflation is likely to  temporarily rise above 2 percent on a 12month basis when the low March and April price readings from last year fall out of our  preferred  12month PCE measure.
 Transitory inflationary pressures are possible if there is a surge of demand that outstrips su pply in certain sectors when the economy opens up fully.
" The size of such a surge in demand will depend in part on the effects of additional fiscal stimulus, along with any spenddown of accumulated savings, which are uncertain.8  But a surge in demand a nd any inflationary bottlenecks would likely be transitory, as fiscal tailwinds to growth early this year are likely to transition to headwinds sometime thereafter ."
 A burst of transitory inflation seems more proba ble than a durable shift above target in t he inflation trend and an unmooring of inflation expectations to the upside.
" When considering the inflation outlook, it is important to remember that inflation has averaged slightly below 2 percent for over a quarter -century."
" In the nine years since  the FOMC’s announcement of a 2 percent inflation objective , 12month PCE inflation has averaged under 11/2 percent."
" Readings of 12month inflation have been below  8 For examples of the range of estimates of the effects of the expected fiscal stimulus , see Wendy Edelberg and Louise Sheiner (2021), “ The Macroeconomic Implications of Bi den’s $1.9 Trillion Fiscal Package ,” Brookings Institution, January 28, https://www.brookings.edu/blog/upfront/2021/01 /28/themacroeconomic -implications -ofbidens -19-trillion -fiscal -package ; Alex Arnon, Daniela Viana Costa, Zheli He, Austin Herrick, Jon Huntley, Marcos Dinerstein, Victoria Osorio, and John Ricco  (2021),  “Macroeconomic Effects of the $1.9 Trillion Biden COVID Relief Plan ,” Penn Wharton Budget Model (Philadelphia:  Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, February 3), https://budgetmodel.wharton.upenn.edu/issues/2021/2/3/macroeconomic -effects -of19- trillion -biden -covid -relief -plan ; and Olivier Blanchard (2021),  “In Defense of Concerns over the $1.9 T rillion Relief Plan,” RealTime Economic Issues Watch (Washington:   Peterson Institute for International Economic s, February 18), https://www.piie.com/blogs/r ealtime -economic -issueswatch/defense -concerns -over -19trillion -relief -plan."
" According to recent research , statistical models estimate that underlying core PCE inflation ranges from one - to fourtenths of 1 percentage point below our 2 percent longer -run target.9  Recall that at the end of 2019, with unemployment at a multidecade low and after the addition of almost 1 -1/2 million workers  to the labor force during the previous year, PCE inflation was 1.6 percent for the year."
"  Monetary Policy  With that outlook in mind, let me turn to monetary policy."
" After an extensive review, the FOMC  revised its monetary policy framework to reflect important changes in economic relationships  characterized by a low equilibrium interest rate,  inflation persistently  below target , and low sensitivity of inflation to resource utilization."
" The new framework calls for monetary policy to seek to eliminate s hortfalls  of employment from its maximum level, in contrast to the previous approach that called for policy to minimize deviations  when employment is too high as well as too low."
 It  emphasizes  that maximum employment is a broadbased  and inclusive goal  assessed by a wide range of indicators.
" In addition,  in order to  keep longer -term inflation expectations well anchored at our 2 percent goal , monetary policy  will seek to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time."
" Consequently,  following periods when inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately  above 2 percent for some time."

 - 7 - These change s mean that we will not tighten monetary policy solely in response to a s trong labor market .
 The longstanding presumption that accommodation should be reduced preemptively when  the unemployment rate nears estimates of the neutral rate in anticipation of high inflation that is unlikely to materialize  risks an unwarranted loss of opportunity for many of the most economically vulnerable Americans.10  It may curtail progress for racial and ethnic groups that have faced systemic  challenges in the labor force .
" Instead, t he shortfalls approach will enable  the labor market to continue to improve absent clear indications of high inflationary pressures or an unmooring of inflation expectations to the  upside ."
 The guidance indicates an  expect ation  that it will be appropriate to maintain the current target range of the federal funds rate until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee ’s assessments of maximum employment and inflation h as risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.
"  Even after economic conditions warrant liftoff, changes in the policy rate are likely to be only gradual , as the forward guidance  notes that monetary policy will remain ac commodative  in order to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time."

"  - 8 - In assessing substantial further progress, I will be looking for realized progress toward both our employment and  inflation goals."
" I will be looking for indicators that show the progress on employment is broad based and inclus ive rather than focusing solely on the aggregate headline unemployment rate, especially in light of the significant decline in labor force participation since the spread of COVID and the elevated unemployment rate for workers in the lowest -wage quartile an d other disproportionately affected groups.11   Likewise, while I will carefully monitor inflation expectations, it will be important to achieve a sustained improvement in actual inflation to meet our average inflation goal."
"  The past decade of underperfor mance on our inflation target highlights that reaching 2 percent inflation will require patience, and we have pledged to hold the policy rate in its current range until not only has  inflation risen to 2  percent but it  is also on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time."
" Given the path of inflation to date, our framework calls for inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time."
" If, in the future, inflation rises immoderate ly or persistentl y above target, and there is evidence that longer -term inflation expectations are moving above our longer -run goal, I would not hesitate to act and believe we have the tools to carefully guide inflation down to target."
"  Today the economy remains far from our goals in terms of both employment and inflation , and it will take some time  to achieve substantial further progress."
"  Jobs are still 10 million below the pre -COVID level, and inflation  has been running below 2 percent for years."
