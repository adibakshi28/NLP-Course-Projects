" Today, I want to discuss regulatory policies in the context of the growth and inevitable collapse of asset bubbles, with a focus on the role of credit."
"And , to appro ximate current economic conditions, we’ll assume an environment of interest rates that have been low, and continue to be low, for a long time."
" At the same time, increased demand f or credit to finance these asset purchases could lead lenders t o increase their reliance on less expensive, unstable short -term funding , such as uninsured deposits, commercial paper, or repo transactions , in order to fund the loans."
"  Besides meeting custom ers’ growing  demands for credit, financial intermediaries may themselves decide to “reach for yield” and take on additional risk in a low interest -rate environment."
"Banks suffering compressed net interest margins because of low long -term interest rates, mo ney market funds facing an earnings squeeze, insurance companies that had promised minimum rates of return on their products , and others may all begin to take on higher interest rate risk, market risk, liquidity risk, or credit risk in search of higher returns."
" If these conditions seem likely to continue, an  initial rise in the asset’s price lead s to expectations of further increases, which add s to investor demand, spurring further borrowing and credit growth and increased household and financial sector leverage, which , in turn , could drive asset prices still higher."
" Financial institution decisions to r elax underwriting and impose lessstringent margins  and haircuts will further increase the pool  of potential borrowers and their borrowing capacity, further increasing credit growth and supporting still higher asset prices, but, at the same time, will also increa se lenders’ credit risks and exposure --as secured creditors --to a decline in the asset’s  price."
" Indeed, a  dramatic decline in the price of a significant asset can reduce household wealth, spending , and aggregate demand."
"  When  such effects on wealth, credit availability, and aggregate demand are large  enough, the real economy can suffer a significant recession."
"And, of course, lower employment and income s further depress asset prices and borrowers’ a bility to repay loans, with further adverse effects on financial institutions and their ability  to extend credit ."
"And asset bubbles are characterized by many investors chasing the same asset, and so there is generally wide -spread participation in the growth and nurturing of the bubble."
But  it is my view that asset bubbles are a feature of our financial landscape; that what happened before could happen again; and that the growth and after -effects of asset bubbles reflect particu lar financial institution decisions and particular regulatory policy choices or lapses.
" Of co urse, m onetary policy also has the power to  lean against the growth of asset bubbles."
"While there could be situations in which monetary polic y might be needed to try to limit  the growth of a bubble, in my opinion  such use would represent a failure of  - 7 - regul atory policy, which represents a more tailored response than the flattening out of aggregate demand that would likely result from contractionary monetary policy ."
" Without plumbing the dept hs of each type of tool, I’ll say a few words about each as it relates to the curbing of excess credit growth that fuels asset bubbles and to mitigating the effects of a bubble’s collapse."
"Thus, higher capital requirements , to some degree,  also lean against excessive credit growth that can fuel asset bubbles ."
"In that sense, minimum liquidity requiremen ts also lean against building vulnerabilities that could accompany the growth of an asset bubble."
" Haircuts tend to be cyclical : falling in good times, which adds to the growth of credit, and rising in busts, which contracts credit."
" In other words, by requir ing increased margin, the growth of credit can be slowed and resiliency can be strengthened."
This would lean against the growth of bubbles even if regulators had not yet discerned the particular type of asset bubble growing.
" At the same time, by actively leaning progressively harder against property -related credit expansion, they may restrain excessive credit growth and property price appreciation, and reduce the chances --and magn itude --of a sharp price bust."
" Regulatory policies that aim to increase the resilience of regulated institutions , and lean against asset bubbles by restraining the growth of lending by such instituti ons, can be  - 13 - circumvented when  financial activities migrate into less regulated parts of the financial system, parts likely farther from the protections of deposit insurance and the lender of last resort."
And such a fragmented structure i tself demands  unusual and extensive degrees of coordination and cooperation among financial regulators so as to maximize the potential for comprehensive and harmonized regulation.
"Prior to the peak of housing prices, interest rates were low, making mortgage payments affordable ; real incomes were rising ; population was growing ; and household formation was high --all “fundamental” determinants of the demand for housing and house prices."
"These reforms will build resilience to whatever shocks may come , and will reduce the potential for asset bub bles and excessive credit growth, leverage, maturity transformation, reliance on unstable short -term wholesale funding, and, thus, the potential for future financial crises."
"Only when such tools --be they capital -focused, liquidity -focused, margin --and haircut -focused , or underwriting -focused --are fully embedded into a comprehensive system of prudential regulation will they reach their potential in mitigating the growth of asset bubbles and providing resiliency against the awful consequences attendant to their destruction."
