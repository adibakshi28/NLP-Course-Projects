"For release on delivery  10:30 a.m. EDT  June 27, 2013         Thoughts on Unconventional Monetary Policy     Remarks by   Jerome H."
 I will comment briefly on the outlook for the economy and then turn to monetary policy.1  NearTerm Outlook  Our economy has grown at an average annual rate of only about  2 percent since the recovery began exactly four years ago.
" That modest pace is notably weaker than the experience of past recoveries would have predicted, even accounting for the depth and duration of the Great Recession.2  Since 2009, the question has been when the recovery will decisively take hold and begin to deliver the higher levels of growth that are needed to put people back to work more quickly."
"       Against that background, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) met last week, and , among other tasks , each of the 19 members of the Committee submitted individual economic projections for growth, unemployment , and inflation for 2013 through 2015."
 FOMC participants generally expect an acceleration of the recovery through 2013 and 2014 and continued strong growth in 2015.
" I would point in particular to the housing sector , which in prior recoveries has been an important engine of growth."
" F or the first two years of the current recovery , housing contribute d nothing  to growth, as housing investment hovered at extremely low levels."
 But overall tren ds suggest to me that the housing recovery can continue for many years and become an important contributor to growth.
  Growth would be higher  this year but for U.S. fiscal policy.
 The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that federal tax increases and spending cuts will slow the  - 3 - pace of real gross domestic product ( GDP ) growth about 11/2 percentage points this year.3  Tight fiscal policy may also be preventing faster reductions in unemployment.
 I have been surprised by how well consumer spending --and private domestic final demand more generally --have held up in the face of this pronounced fiscal drag.
" In the first quarter of this year , consumer spending and private domestic final demand rose at an annual rate of just above 21/2 percent."
 More -recent indicators of household and business spending suggest that private demand is continuing to advance at a reasonable clip despite the fisca l tightening.
" Let’s turn to monetary policy, starting with the dual mandate, pursuant to which the Congres s directs the Federal Reserve to conduct monetary policy so as to foster stable prices and full employment."
"  Dual Mandate —Inflation  Inflation is currently running below the FOMC’s 2 percent long -term objective for personal consumption expenditure (PCE) price inflation, and these readings have our attention."
  But inflation often fluctuates for transitory reasons.
  - 4 - factors point to a gradual increase in inflation.
"While some measures of longer -term inflation expectations have moved down, others remain m ore stable."
  Most FOMC participants anticipate that inflation will gradually move up to the FOMC’s 2  percent target over coming years.
" Continued low or falling inflation could, however, raise real concerns."
 Inflation can be too low as well as too high.
" I have no doubt that the Committee will monitor this carefully and defend the inflation goal “from below ,” if necessary."
   Dual Mandate —Full Employment  The employment side of the dual mandate is a different story.
" From payroll employment’s peak in Januar y 2008 to its trough in February  2010, the U.S. economy lost nearly 9 million jobs, while the unemployment rate rose from an average of about 41/2 percent in 2007 to a high of 10 percent in October  of 2009."
 Unemployment was 7.6 percent in May and so has come down about 21/2 percentage points from its peak.
"   In addition, long -term unemployment remains very high --4.4 million Americans or about 37 percent of the unemployed have been out of work for six  months or more."
" To summarize, although inflation is below target, it is expected by most observers to return over time to the Committee’s 2 percent objective."
 T he Committee will continue to carefully monitor inflation developments.
 But we are still far from full employment.
 The case for continued support for the economy from monetary policy is strong.
" Implications for Monetary Policy  The federal funds rate has been near zero since late 2008, and since then the FOMC has been providing accommodation through two relatively new policy tools."
" These tools are “forward guidance” about the future level of the federal funds rate, which is the interest rate charged on overnight loans between banks, and l argescale a sset purchase programs (“asset purchases ,” or LSAPs )."
" The Committee indicated its intention to hold short -term rates near zero at least as long as unemployment remains above 6.5  percent, provided inf lation oneto two -years ahead is projected to be no higher than 2.5 percent.4  And under the current flow -based LSAP program, adopted last year, we are purchasing $85 billion a month in long -term Treasur y securities  and agency mortgage -backed securities (MBS)."
                                                   4 The Committee’s long -run objective for PCE inflation remains 2 percent.
" See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2013), “FOMC Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy,” statement, January 29, www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_LongerRunGoals.pdf ."
" - 6 - I see t he first tool, forward guidance about rates, a s really an extension of traditional central bank rate -setting policy."
" The Committee will continue to use interest rate policy, including forward guidance about short -term rates, as we return to full employment."
" Provided inflation remains  in check, the Committee will begin to assess whether to increase shortterm rates when unemployment reaches 6.5  percent ."
" First, if inflation remains low, as expected, that would be a signal that there is still significant slack in the economy."
" Second, a variety of other information will shed further light on the health of the labor market, including the labor force participation rate, flows into and out of employment, and other measures of l abor slack."
" After the Committee first raises shortterm rates, it will take a balanced, and in all likelihood  - 7 - gradual, approach consistent with its longer -run goals of full employment and inflation of 2 percent ."
Both forward guidance and asset purchases w ork by lowering longer -term interest rates and contributing to an easing of overall financial market conditions.
 Lower rates increase economic activity through a variety of channels.5  Businesses and households react to lower rates by investing and spendi ng more.
" The second round of purchases that began in November 2010 also appears to have been successful in countering disinflationary pressures.6                                                    5 See Jonathan McCarthy (2013), “The Monetary Transmission Mechanism,” speech delivered at “The Federal Reserve in t he 21st Century:  A Symposium for College Professors,” held in New York, March 45, www.newyorkfed.org/education/fed21_2013.html ."

" The Fed’s workhorse macro model is FRB/US, which estimates a reduction of about 20 basis points in the unemployment rate after three years in the wake of $500 billion in purchases of longer -term securities."
" There are also reasons to think that the estimate might be too hig h, since some of the channels by which lower rates spur economic activity could be attenuated in current circumstances, for example, by lower credit availability for small businesses and less creditworthy households, or corporate and household risk aversion."
  My view is that the LSAPs continue to provide meaningful support for economic activity but perhaps less than what the FRB/US estimates suggest.
" Beyo nd these model -predicted effects, it also seems likely that the economy continues to benefit from the knowledge that the Federal Reserve is committed to supporting growth as long as necessary."

" With inflation in check, the most important potential risk, in my view, is that of financial instability."
 Monetary policy has helped to keep real interest rates low.
" But low rates are not solely or even primarily  a result of the Federal Reserve’s accommodative monetary policies; they are rooted in the market’s expectations of low inflation and the weakness of the economic recovery, factors weighing on rates not just in the United States but throughout the advanced  economies.7  Given low real rates and low inflation, expected nominal returns should be low across all asset classes."

"  But, as my Board colleague Jeremy Stein has observed, there have been signs of a “reach for yield” in the fixed -income markets for some time.8  Demand for  higher -yielding fixed -income securities has outstripped new supply."
  The second concern is that the process of normalizing monetary policy and the balance sheet could itself be destabilizing  or disruptive to the economy .
" The unemployment and inflation thresholds I discussed earlier, as well as the communication around asset purchases, are all designed to improve public understanding of the Committee’s inte ntions."
"  The Path Ahead for Monetary Policy  Last week, the Chairman provided greater clarity about the path of asset purchases."
" At that time, the unemployment rate would likely be in the vicinity of 7  percent , with growth consistent with f urther improvements and inflation heading back toward our objective."
" If unemployment reaches the 7  percent  range, that would constitute a substantial improvement from the 8.1 percent  unemployment rate that prevailed when the Committee announced the current program of asset purchases ."
" When the Committee met in September, the unemployment rate stood at  8.1 percent ."
" Today, just nine  months later, the unemployment rate is 7.6 percent --a larger decline than most FOMC participants expected in September."
" At the time of the September meeting, nonfarm payrolls were reported to have increased at a monthly rate of 97,000 over the prior six  months.9  Today the trailing six -month average payroll growth is 194,000."
"                                                  9 The level of payroll employment would subsequently be revised up, but the Committee didn’t know at the Septembe r 2012 meeting that the revision would occur."
"  - 13 - Other labor market indicators also show moderate progress, including aggregate hours worked, initial unemployment insurance claims, the duration of unemployment, and the share of long -term unemployment."
" If economic growth, unemployment , or inflation do not meet the Committee’s expectations, or if finan cial conditions evolve in a way that is inconsistent with continued recovery, the Committee will respond."
