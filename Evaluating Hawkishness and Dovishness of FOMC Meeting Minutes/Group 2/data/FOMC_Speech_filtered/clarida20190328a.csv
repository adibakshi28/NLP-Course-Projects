" It is a pleasure to be here at the Banque de France and take part in this important symposium  on the “ Euro Area:  Staying the Course t hrough Uncertainties .”1   Both in the financial press  and in international policy circles, one hears a great deal about the spillovers of U.S. monetary policy to other ec onomies."
" I will close with a few words on current prospects, in which global crosscurrents are again posing challenges for the U.S. economy and monetary policy."
" 2 A recent exception is Ferrara and Teuf (2018), who construct an international environment indicator, based on a textual analysis of Federal Open Market Committee minutes, and examine the connection between this indicator and U.S. monetary policy."
"  For concreteness, let  us consider the case of a negative demand shock originating abroad, such as a foreign recession."
" First, this shock affects the United  States through direct trade links, lowering demand for U.S. exports and, thus , lowering U.S. GDP."
" Second, the foreign recession leads to lower interest rates abroad and, other t hings being equal , raises  the value of the dollar, which in turn lower s U.S. exports and boost s U.S. imports."
" The dollar appreciat ion also puts downward pressure  on U.S. import prices and, thereby, inflation."
 Let me first elaborate on  the exchange rate channel  I just mentioned .
" The traditional determinants of exchange rates --that is, differentials in expected rates of return --apply to the United States as to other countries."
" However, the same safehaven flows into Treasur y securities would cause U.S. long -term yields to fall, mitigating these adverse effects on domestic demand and activity.5   Historical Experience  Let us consider some historical examples of the effect of adverse foreign shocks on the U .S."
" T he Mexican peso crisis of 1994 and ’ 95 and the Asian financial crisis of 1997 through ’ 98 resulted in substantial hits  to aggregate emerging market economy ( EME)  growth, but they  had fairly muted effects on U.S. growth.6  In part, this limited response in previous decades reflected the smaller share of the EMEs in the global economy and, as a related matter, in U.S. trade."
 6 Most studies discussing contagion effects of the Mexican peso crisis focu s on effects on other Latin American countries and do not highlight effects on U.S. growth.
"   In recent times , global shocks have also been  consequential for U.S. economic prospects and monetary policy."
" As ever, these negati ve shocks were associated with safehaven flows that pushed U.S. T reasury yields down.9  Despite the drop in yields , overall financial conditions in the United States tightened, weighing on aggregate demand.10                                                    8 Dell’Ariccia, Zettelmeyer , and  Schnabel  (2002) argue that the more -substantial response of global financial markets to the Russian def ault was because investors were expecting Russia to be rescued from having to default by the International Monetary Fund, and there was a global retreat from risk when that did not happen."
" U.S. and other financial markets are attuned to a number o f prominent downside global risks , which include Brexit, a sharp slowdown in global growth prospects , and trade tensions."
" Even though the Fed has  been  and is committed to a dual mandate to achieve maximum employment and  price stability,  in today’s world, U.S. policymakers can                                                  11 The quantitative easing was important, because the United States had already reduced the policy rate to zero and --as argued, for example, in Bodenstein, Erceg, and Guerrieri (2009) --the spillover effects of adverse foreign demand shocks to the U.S. economy are significantly amplified at the zero lower bound for the policy rate in the absence of other expansionary policies."
" In addition, in our policy statement s, as well as in other communications, we have indicated that , in the presence of these risks and with inflation pressures muted, we can afford to be pati ent and data dependent as we assess in future meetings what adjustments in our pol icy rate might be necessary  to sustain growth, employment, and pric e stability in the U .S."
