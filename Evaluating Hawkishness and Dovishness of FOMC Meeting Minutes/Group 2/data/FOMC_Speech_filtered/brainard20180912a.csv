"For release on delivery  12:45 p.m. EDT  September 12, 2018         What Do We Mean by  Neutral and What Role Does I t Play in Monetary Policy?"
" While challenges remain in many of the city’s neighborhoods, since that time the metropolitan area overall has seen signs of a rebound  in bus iness activity and investment, and the unemployment rate has continued to trend downward , recently falling to 4.3 percent .1 This is similar to the nation’s economy more broadly."
" While challenges remain  for many, aggregate growth is strong, and the economy  is meeting our full employment and inflation objectives."
" Given th e outlook, it comes as no surprise that the F ederal Open Market Committee (FOMC)  has been gradually raising interest rates from crisis -era lows and sees further gradual increases as likely to be appropriate  in its  most recent statement.2  Before discussing the outlook, it might be useful to first explore  some concepts that are important in informing the path of rates."
" I ntuitively, I  think of the nominal neutral interest rate as the level of  the federal funds rate that keeps output growing around its potential  rate in an environment of full employment and stable inflation.3                                                      1 I am grateful to John Roberts of the Federal Reserve Board for his assistance in preparing this text."
 3 The closely related concept of the natural rate of interest --the rate of interest at which investment and savings are equilibrated at full employment-- is originally attributed to Swedish economist Knut Wicksell.
" For instance, l egislation that increases the budget deficit through tax cuts and spending increases  can be expected to generate tailwinds to domestic demand  and thus to push up the  shorter -run neutral interest rate."
" Conversely, many of t he forces that contributed to the financial crisis --such as fear and uncertainty on the part of businesses and households --can be e xpected to lower the neutral rate of interest, as can declin es in foreign demand for U.S. exports ."
"In many circumstances, monetary policy can help keep the economy on its sustainable path at full employment by adjusting the policy rate to reflect movements  in the shorter -run neutral rate ."
" In this context, the appropriate reference  for assessing the stance of monetary policy is the gap between the policy rate and the nominal shorter -run neutral rate."
"  So far, I have been focusing on the  shorter -run neutral rate of interest  that i s respons ive to headwinds or tailwinds to demand."
" The underlying concept of the “longer run” generally refer s to the output growing at its longer -run trend , after tr ansitory forces reflecting headwinds or tailwinds have played out , in an environment of  full employment and inflation running  at the FOMC objective.4                                                      The natural rate and the neutral rate are closely related concepts whose technical differences matter for economic theory and estimation, but less for the intuitive discussion here."
 - 3 - The longer -run federal funds rate  estimated by FOMC participants  in their Summary of Economic Projection s (SEP) meets the definition of a  longer -run equilibrium  rate of interest.5  It is worth highlighting that t he longer -run federal funds rate is the only neutral  interest rate  reported in the FOMC  projections .
" But the shorter -run neutral rate, rather than the longer -run federal funds rate , is the relevant benchmark for assessing the  nearterm path of monetary policy in the presence of headwinds or tailwinds ."
"  Estimating the Neutral  Rate of Interest  Similar to other equilibrium macroeconomic concepts such a s potential  gross domestic product ( GDP ) and the natural rate of unemployment,  the shorter - and longer -run levels of  the neutral rate are  not directly observable , so they must be estimated or inferred from the movements of variables that are observed, such as market interest rates, inflation, the unemployment rate, and GDP.6  In recent years,  considerable work has derived  estimates of the long errun equilibrium rate , in some cases using statistical techniques  that can be thought of as capturing the highly persistent component of the neutral rate."
" The central tendency of those estimates suggest s that the long errun trend rate is in the range of 2 .5 to 3.5 percent in nominal terms.7  This range  lines up well with the most recent  median estimate of the longer -run federal funds rate in  the FOMC  SEP,                                                    5 As defined in the FOMC SEP , “Longer -run projections represent each participant ’s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy.”   See the most recent SEP, an addendum to the minutes of the June 2018 FOMC meeting, available in a July 5, 2018, press release on the Board’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20180705a.htm ."
" By these estimates, the longer -run neutral rate has fallen  considerably from  the estimate d range  in earlier decades  of 4 to 5 percent .8  Turning to the shorter -run neutral rate, although the estimat es are model dependent and uncertain, we can make some general inferences about its recent  evolution that are largely independent of the details of specific models.9  Estimates suggest t he short errun neutral rate tends to be cyclical, falling in recessions and rising during expansions, and our current expansion appears to be  no exception.10   Last year, the unemployment rate returned to pre -crisis levels, which required  real interest rates that wer e below zero for nearly 10 years.11  This year , the unemployment rate has fallen further , and job market gains have gathered strength,  at the same time that the federal funds rate has increased."
 Th is combination suggests that the short -run neutral interest rate likely  has also increased.
"  In the  latest  FOMC  SEP median path , by the end of next year , the federal  funds  rate is projected to  rise to a level that exceeds the longer -run federal funds rate during a                                                     8 A variety of hypotheses have been advanced to explain this decline , including s lower labor  force growth, slower  productivity growth, and an increase in savings propensities."
   - 5 - time when  real GDP growth is projected to exceed its longer -run pace  and unemployment continues to fall .
" As was noted in the recent FOMC minutes , corporate credit spreads are very narro w, and equity valuations are elevated relative to historical patterns, even after taking into account the low level of interest rates.12  Business and consumer confidence is high, which is also consistent with a higher short errun neutral rate of interest."
" By any measure, overall growth in the second quarter was strong."
" Looking ahead, it seems likely that growth will remain solid."
" Confidence is high, private domestic demand  momentum is solid, and recent fiscal  stimul us will continue to work its way t hrough the economy , at least for the next year or so."
"  - 6 - workers, the employment -topopulation ratio is 79."
" These developments are heartening, suggesting the tight labor market is providing employment opportu nities to more Americans."
"  In another encouraging development, wage gains  in the August report reached  their highes t level since the depth of the financial crisis, although wage growth remains moderate by historical standards."
"  At 3.9 percent, t he August unemployment rate was  about  1/2 percentage point lower than the previous year ."
" If unemployment continues to decline at the same rate as we have  seen over the past year, we will soon see unemployment rates not seen since the 1960s."
" Historically, the few periods when resource utilization has been at similarly tight levels have tended to see elevated risks of either accelerating inflation or financial imbalances.13  For instance, t he inflation process may change in unexpected ways."
"  So far, the data on inflation remain encouraging,  providing  little  signal of an outbreak of inflation to the upside, on the one hand, and some  reassurance that underlying trend inflation may be moving closer  to 2 percent, on the other."
 - 7 - measures of inflation compensation remain stable at levels above the lows seen in 2016.
" With  various measures of underlying trend inflation  having come in below our 2 percent objective  over a sustained period, it is important to sustainably achieve inflation around 2 percent to  prevent an erosion of underlying trend inflation the next time the economy faces a downturn and the federal funds rate  hits its lower l imit.14   The past few times unemployment fell to levels as low as  those projected over the next year , signs of ove rheating showed up in financial -sector  imbalances  rather than in accelerating inflation."
" The Federal Reserve’s assessment  suggests that  finan cial vulnerabilities are building, which might be expected after a long period of  economic expansion and very low interest rates."
" Growth in Europe and Japan has moderated from its strong pace of last year, and political risks have reemerged in countries such as Italy."
"growth has pulled away from foreign growth , in part reflec ting fiscal policy divergence,                                                    14 See Brainard (2017)."
" - 8 - expectations of monetary policy divergence strengthened , contributing to upward pressure on the dollar  earlier this year ."
" The resulting currency adjustments are compounding challenges faced by some emerging market economies, along with  a complicated and unpredictable trade environment and gradually increasing interest rates."
" Over the next yea r or two, barring unexpected developments, continued gradual increases in the federal funds rate are likely to be appropriate to sustain full employment and inflation near its objective."
"  This raises the possibility of a flattening or inversion of the yield curve in the event that term premiums do not rise from their currently very low levels.15                                                      15 The standard expectations hypothesis model decomposes longer -term interest rates into a component that represents the influence of expectations of future short -term interest rates and a “term premium.”  Most estimates of the term premium, which are model -based, suggest that term premiums have been very low recently, and some suggest that term premiums are roughly zero across the yield curve."
" If term premiu ms remain low and stable, the component associated with expectations of future short -term interest rates will dominate movements in long -term interest rates."
"   Part of the reason the 10year Treasury yield is unusually low is that market  expectations of interest rates in the longer run are themselves  quite  low, as discussed earlier ."
" If the term premium  remains very low , any given amount of monetary policy tightening will lead to an inversion sooner so that even a modest tightening that might not have led to an inversion historically  could do so today."
" One reason the term premium may be lower than in the past is the chang ed correlation between stock and bond returns, likely associated with changes in expected inflation outcomes.18  The other  driver of  the low lev el of the term premium  globally  is                                                    16 See Estrella and Mishkin (1997) ; Johansson and Meldrum (2018) ; and Favara and others (2016) for more recent analysis."
  It is worth highlighting  that the flattening yield curve suggested by the SEP median is associated with a policy path calibrated to sustain full employment and inflation around target.
" Indeed, t he possibility  that the projected policy  path may have unintended consequences is one of the compelling  reason s for raising interest rates gradually ."
 The gradual pace of  interest rate increases anticipated in the SEP median  path should give us some time to  assess the effects of our policies as we proceed.
" If, for example, underlying inflation were to move abruptly and unexpectedly highe r, it might  be appropriate to depart from the gradual path."
" Stable inflation expectations is one of the ke y achieve ments of central banks in the past several decades, and we would defend it vigorously."
" Conclusion  Our challenge is to sustain full employment and inflation at 2  percent , which  is likely to  warrant continued gradual increases in the federal funds  rate."
" With fiscal stimulus in the pipeline and financial conditions supportive of growth, the shorter -run                                                    19 See, for example, Li and Wei (2013) ; Curcuru, De Pooter, and Eckerd (2018) ; and Curcuru  and others  (2018)."
" - 11 - neutral interest rate is likely to move up somewhat further,  and it may well  surpass the longer -run equilibrium rate for some period ."
