October 1, 2019   Good morning, and welcome to the Federal Reserve Board’s research conference “Nontraditional Data, Machine Learning, and Natural Language Processing in Macroeconomics.”  Here at the Fed , we are continually assessing the current state of the economy, updati ng our  outlook for economic activity, and estimating  the risks around that outlook."
" In this environment, we assess a broad array  of government and private -sector data to determine  what they imply for the achievement of the Fed’s  statutory goals of maximum  employment and price stability ."
"Over these next two days, you will hear about the use of new tools and nontraditional data sources and what they say for the assessment of inflation and the labor market; about the use of new methods for forecasting; and about extracting information from text and using textual analysis to evaluate regulatory complexity and understand central bank communications."
 Now I would like to invite the participants in the session on alternative data on inflation and the labor market to come to the podium.
