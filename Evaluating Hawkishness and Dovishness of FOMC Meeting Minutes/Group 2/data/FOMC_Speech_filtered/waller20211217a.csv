"  In light of November’s job report, I believe the economy is closing in on  maximum employment."
" Accounting for retirees  leaving the workforce , I estimate that employment is only about 11/2 million jobs below its February 2020 level, when monetary policy was less accommodative and unemployment was at a 50 -year low  and below  Federal  Open Market Committee  (FOMC) participants’ estimates of the longer -run unemployment rate ."
" The unemployment rate dropped to 4.2 percent  in November , just a touch above the median of FOMC  participants’  longer -run level  of 4 percent ."
" I have argued for some time that there are upside risks to inflation , and with inflation exceeding the FOMC’s 2 percent target for some time now , I strongly supported the Committee ’s decision this week  to  1 These views are my own and do not represent any position of the Board of Governors or other Federal Reserve policymakers."
 This action  gives us increased flexibi lity to adjust monetary policy as needed in 2022.
" The appropriate timing for  the first increase in the policy rate, of course,  will depe nd on the evolution of economic activity, something that I will be closely monitoring ."
" But given my expectations for inflation and labor market conditions , I believe an increase in the target range for the fed eral funds rate will be warranted shortly after our asset purchases end."
" W e still don’t know how serious a public health threat it will be , so we don’t know if it will slow the U.S. economy, as the Delta variant briefly did, or even possibly slow progress toward maximum employment."
" Cutting the other way, we also do not know if Omicron will exacerbate labor and goods supply shortages and add inflation pressure, derailing the moderation of inflation next year that is my baseline."
" Using a recent example, in May 2021 inflation readings were over  4 percent ."
" If your statistical model predicted that inflation would fall to 2  percent  by the end of 2021, you would be asked why  you are making that prediction."
" All economic activity—every one of the billions of economic decisions that will be made today, and every day—is guided by a view of the future."
" T he effect was a sudden and severe drop in economic activity and significant stress in the financial system, including a significant disruption in Treasury markets."
" While shutdowns and lockdowns were more severe in March and April 2020 in some parts of the country than in others, most of the country was affected, and the drop in employment and spending was larger and faster than the United States had ever experienced."
 The unemployment rate more than quadrupled from a 50year low of 3.5 percent in February to 14.8 percent in April.
"  - 6 - Before  the start of the pandemic, the top and bottom 10 respondents of the Blue Chip survey (meaning those with the highest and lowest forecast s) had an average forecast for 2020 GDP growth of 1.5 percent  and 2.2 percent, respectively , which  is a very tight range."
" Once the pandemic started, th is range exploded,  with GDP growth forecasts ranging from negative 1.1 to negative 7.4 percent ."
 Prepandem ic forecasts for the 2020: Q4 unemployment rate ranged from 3.
" In April 2020, the forecast for the Q4 unemployment rate ranged from 5 .4 to 13.7 percent ."
" Half of the jobs lost were regained in four months, and in seven months the unemployment rate had fallen to 6.7 percent."
" By comparison, a fter the GFC , it took more than two years to regain half of the jobs lost and more than four years to return unemployment to 6.7 percent."
" For example, f igure 1 shows the evolution of the Blue Chip summation of private forecasters’ outlook for the average level of the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of 2020."
" In March, like everyone else, these forecasters had no sense of what was coming ; the consensus was for an  unemployment rate of 3.7 percent near the end of th e year."
 Forecasters adjusted their expectation for the unemployment rate to average near 9  percent  in the fourth quarter of 2020.
" In May, with numbers in hand showing unemployment averaging around 14 percent for March and April, the consensus  Blue  3 For example, see Guillaume Vandenbroucke (2020), “ The Mechanics of Individuallyand Socially -Optimal Decisions during an Epidemic ,” Working Paper Series 2020013B  (St. Louis:  Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, September), https://doi.org/10.20955/wp.2020.013;  Andrew  Glover, J onathan Heathcote, D irk Krueger, and JoseVictor RíosRull  (2020), “Health versus Wealth:  On the Distributional Effects of Controlling a Pandemic ,” NBER Working Paper Series 27046 (Cambridge, Mass."
  - 8 - Chip forecast then suggested a  slowly declining unemployment rate that would average a bit over 10 percent  in Q4 .
" A sl ow decline in unemployment is what we experienced after the GFC , so it made se nse to project a similar slow decline after the virus hit."
" In fact, the unemployment rate dropped to 6.7 percent in November , and that is where it ended the year."
" Even after the dramatic economic rebound in May and June, the change in the consensus view for the unemployment  rate later that year was extremely gradual."
   Same thing for the inflation  forecast this year .
" As figure 2 shows, i n January and February, the Blue Chip consensus was for consumer price inflation for Q4  to average about  2 percent."
" Just last Friday , November CPI inflation was reported at 6.8 percent for the 12 months ending November, the largest 12month increase since mid -1982."
" Instead of an unemployment rate of 6.7 percent at yearend 2020, we predicted 9.3 percent."
" We predicted that inflation based on personal consumption expenditures would be 1.8 percent  this year ,  - 9 - instead of the 5  percent it hit in October ."
 Both weekly paid employment and active employment  from ADP  have provided insight into the labor market ahead of when monthly employment numbers are released.
"  Lesso n 4:  Globalization Is Fragile , and Inflation Ain’t Dead   After two years of surprises, persistently elevated inflation  is the biggest surprise for me, and I am carefully watching how this plays out in the next few months."
 High inflation is a heavy burden for households  that have no choice about paying higher prices for groceries and other necessities.
 O ne of the Federal Reserve’s most important responsibilities is keeping prices stable and inflation under control.
"  Like most economists, after the p erformance of inflation over the past decade, it would have been hard for me to believe that it could run as high and as long as it has."
" Likewise, I have been surprised at the persistence of the bottlenecks and other supply disruptions that have been a prominent  source of elevated inflation."
"  - 12 - Similarly, I would have expected that labor supply shortages would have eased as the vaccine became widely available, unemployment benefits faded, and wages improve d at the fastest rate in decades."
" This brings me back to my outlook for the economy in 2022, and the implications for monetary policy."
" The economy is set to continue growing very strongly through at least the first hal f of next year, and I expect employment to keep growing."
" With the unemployment rate at 4.2 percent in November, I believe we are very close to meeting the FOMC’s maximumemployment goal."
" For inflation, a s I said earlier, the next few months will be cruci al in determining whether price increases will begin to moderate, as I still expect in my baseline outlook."
"  However, I will be closely watching indicators of inflation expectations for signs that consumers and investors have come to expect high inflation well into the future, a development that could signal that the moderation in inflation I expect will not be coming soon."
" So, by choosing to speed up our reductions in asset purchases , the FOMC is providing  flexibility for other adjustments to monetary policy, if needed, as early as spring to accommodate changes in the economic outlook."
"  Omicron, as I said earlier, could slow the recovery or exacerbate inflation pressures, so we will have to be ready in the coming weeks to adjust as needed."
