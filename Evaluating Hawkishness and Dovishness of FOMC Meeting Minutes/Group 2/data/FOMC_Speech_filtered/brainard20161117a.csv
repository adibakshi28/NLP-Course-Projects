"For release on delivery  12:30 p.m.  EST  November  17, 201 6         The “Gig” Economy :  Implications of t he Growth of Contingent Work     Remarks by   Lael Brainard   Member   Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at  “Evolution of Work ,” a convening cosponsored by  the Board of Governors  of the Federal Reserve System ,  the Federal Reserve Bank of New York,  and the Freelancers Union   New York, N ew York        November 17, 2016   I would like to thank Bill Dudley and Sara Hor owitz for inviting me to participate in today’s conference ."
 The Congress has mandated  the Federal Reserve to  implement monetary polic y so as to  promote maximum employment and stable prices .
" Understanding  the chang ing nature of  employment in today’s economy  is not only central to the mis sion of the Fed eral Reserve , but also goes to the core of who we are as providers for our families and productive members of society .1  In contrast t o traditional work arrangement s, in which an employee has a durable  employment relationship with a  single primary  employer, a large and growing proportion of the workforce is working through contracting, temporary arrangements, on -call arrangements, or as freelancers  being  hired for episodic “gigs."
" They often  provide considerably greater  flexib ility than long -term employment contracts , allowing workers and employers to move in and out of work relationships easily ."
"  - 2 - employment relationship, this  enhanced  flexibility could have benefits and costs that accrue to workers and employers very differently ."
"  For monetary policy , the growth of contingent  work affects  the way we a ssess maximum employment and  the way we interpret  important labor market  outcomes , such as the level of part -time employment and aggregate hours  worked ."
" This rapid increase is in marked contrast to the  preceding decade , when contingent workers remained at a relatively stable 10 percent of the  workforce , according to the B ureau of Labor Statistic s’ (BLS) CWS.3  They conclude that al l of the net growth in aggregate employment in the decade leading up to 2015 can be accounted for by  contingent  work arrangements , which means there has been  no net employment growth in traditional work arrangements."
"  These developments , under the rubric of the “gig,” “on -demand,” “platform,” or “sharing” econ omy, have the potential to be transformative."
"  Diana Farrell and Fiona Greig  (2016) reach a similar conclusion , using a unique and rich data set.7 The Federal Reserve Boa rd fielded a survey to better understand the many ways  adults  are generating income , regardless of their employment status and the frequency of these activities ."
"  By contrast, roughly half of the Upwork respondents do informal work in addition to traditional employment relationships ; almost 10 percent derive their income from multiple different types of arrangements , including both traditional employment relationships and freelancing, while about 9 percent report having a full -time traditional job and “moonlighting” to gain additional income on top of that ."
 The group that deriv es income from multiple dif ferent types of jobs has evidence d the fastest growth over the last few years covered by the survey.
"                                                       Some informal workers in the EIWA would not meet the definition of employment in the C urrent Population Survey  (CPS) either because they did  not do work in the CPS reference week (the EIWA asks about activities over the past six months, not during the reference week) or because they would  not categorize the covered activities  (such as the occasional selling of goods or renting of property)  as work."
" The EIWA survey suggests that  over the previous six months , roughly 11  percent of adults  in the U nited States have engaged  in paid service s using an online platform , such as arranging transportation activities with companies such as Uber , arranging work opportunities on sites like Care.com , Amazon Mechanical  Turk , or TaskRabbit, generating projects through companies such as Fiverr , selling goods and crafts on sites such as eBay  and Etsy , and renting rooms or homes through services like Airbnb, among others.10  This figure is  much  larger than the Katz and Krueger finding of 0.5 percent , partly because the EIWA survey was fielded to all adults regardless of their formal employment status, asked about all online paid services , and used a sixmonth lookback period , rather than the past week ."
" Similarly, a respondent in her 20s works part time as a dental hygienist and supplements thi s employment with about 8 hours per month of additional gig work."
   Better data  should help deepen our  understand ing of  how the growth of contingent work  is changing the behavior of workers and employe rs and what th ese development s imply for the overall economy and household  welfare.
"  From a m acroeconomic perspective, we should be attuned to the possibility that the growth in flexible work arrangements may alter the natural rate of  employment and how the labor market reacts to shocks  as we  assess the  cyclical  behavior of important aggregates --such as labor force participation, employment, hours worked, and underemployment ."
"   One possibility is that new technologies, by lowering the  barriers to workforce entry, could raise employment and labor force participation."
"  Importantly, any such increases in participation and employment would likely be structural, not cyclical, enabling  the economy to run  at a sustainably higher level."
   The increasing prevalence of gig work may also affect  the unemployment rate  and productivity .
"To the extent that gigs provide an easy entryway to employment , unemployment may decrease ."
" The net effect on unemployment is, thus, unclear."
"  Regarding productivity, gig work could lower aggregate productivity to the extent that it requires less human capital or specialized knowledge than traditional jobs, or if it primarily increases hours worked by lower -skilled individuals."
"  That said , gig work, especially when enabled by new technologies, may allow hours to respond more flexibly  to changes in demand and individuals to more easily connect with many different clients or employers."
" As a result, worker s’ downtime and the time required to acquire new  clients  and manage existing clients may decrease, in which case resource utilization  and productivity may increase."
"  - 11 - It is also possible that the increasing prevalence of gig work will cause the cyclical behavior of unemployment, participation, and the workweek to change , with implications for how we assess the  amount of slack."
"  If new technologies make it easier to find gig work, then we could see unemployment rise less in recessions, to the extent that  gig workers are counted as employed."
"  However, it could be that individu als who are able to avoid unemployment through contingent work would still be underemployed if it is difficult to cobble together enough gigs to achieve  fulltime employment ."
 This would likely show up as lower average work weeks and higher levels of involu ntary parttime employment during downturns.
"  As a result, cyclical changes in resource utilization could be reflected less in movements in  the unemployment rate and more in variation in hours per worker."
"  Beyond the behavior of macroeconomic  variables , it is unclear how the growth of different types of gig work affects the welfare of worker s."
" Welfare should increase in cases where  gig work meets the needs of workers by providing a low -barrier means of accessing employment and by allowing workers  to better match actual hours worked with desired hours of work , especially if the gig work is available at times and in places where traditional work opportunities are in short supply ."
" For e xample, 24 percent of  informal workers in the EIWA survey  indicated that contingent work had offset their spells  of unemployment , loss of working hours, loss of benefits , or frozen wages in their formal employment “very much ” or “somewhat."
" Several recent articles describe the challenges faced by these just -intime workers, who must conform their hours to the daily and even hourly ebbs and flows of business, often not knowing whether t hey will have work on a given day until they call in that morning to inquire .13  These arrangements can leave workers scrambling to patch together child care, elder care, and transportation to meet the often unpredictable demands of their workplace , while making it difficult to engage in regularly scheduled activities to enhance  their income and opportunit ies, such as a second job or career training."
"  Moreover , contingent work generally does not offer employer -based benefits and workplace prote ctions that come with traditional employment opportunities , like overtime compensation, minimum wage protections , health insurance , fami ly leave, employer -sponsored re tirement plans, workers’ compensation, and paid sick leave."
" As a result , for some, contingent work may entail  greater  risks than in traditional fulltime employment , with more variable and less predictable hours and earnings ."
" - 14 - unemployment  and disability  insurance, to better support some types of contingent work."
" We may also want to encourage  the additional saving that many contingent workers need to ensure that their basic consumption needs are not sacrificed when demand for their work declines , perhaps by providing monetar y or other types of incentives ."
"  Taking into account the potentially varied effects of the rising prevalence of gig work on household welfare, public policy should strive to maximize the benefit s of the greater flexibility and lower entry barriers provided by advances in technology, while addressi ng the risks that currently accompany many forms of gig employment."
