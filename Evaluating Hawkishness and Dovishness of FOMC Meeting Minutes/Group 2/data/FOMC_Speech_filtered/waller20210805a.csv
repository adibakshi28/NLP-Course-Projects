"    Remarks by   Christopher Waller   Member   Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at  The American Enterprise Institute   Washington, D.C.  (via webcast)       August 5, 2021   The payment system is changing in profound ways as individuals demand faster payments, central banks including the Fed respond, and nonbank entities seek a greater role in facilitating payments."
" Alternatively, what market failure or inefficiency demands this specific intervention?"
"See David Andolfatto, Aleksander Berentsen and Christophe r Waller , “Monetary Policy with Asset -Backed Money,”  Journal of Economic Theory  164 (July 2016): 166– 86."
" In short, banks peg the exchange rate between commercial bank money and the U.S ."
" Due to substantial regulatory and supervisory oversight and f ederal deposit insurance, households and firms reasonably view this fixed exchange rate as perfectly credible."
  The credibility of this fixed exchange rate between commercial and central bank money is what allows our payment system to be stable and efficient.
" Depo sits would flow from commercial banks into CBDC accounts, which would put pressure on banks to lower their fees, or raise the interest rate paid on deposits, to prevent additional deposit outflows.13 It seems to me, however, that private -sector innovations  might reduce the markup charged by banks more effectively than a CBDC would.14  If commercial banks are earning rents from their market power, then there is a profit opportunity for nonbanks to enter the payment business and provide the general public wit h cheaper payment services."
" The introduction of a CBDC in China, for example, likely will allow the Chinese government to more closely monitor the economic activity of its citizens."
" (Of course, Federal Reserve CBDC accounts that are available to persons outside the United States migh t promote use of the dollar, but global availability of Federal Reserve CBDC accounts would also raise acute problems related to, among other things, money laundering.)  Finally, could it be that new forms of private money, such as stablecoins, represent a threat to the Federal Reserve for conducting monetary policy?"
 It is well established in international economics that any country that pegs its exchange rate to the U.S. dollar surrenders its domestic monetary policy to the United States and imports U.S. monetary policy.
 This same logic applies to any entity that pegs its exchange rate to the U.S. dollar.
" Consequently, commercial banks and stablecoins pegged to the U.S. dollar act as conduits for U.S. monetary policy and amplify policy actions."
" So, if anything, private stablecoins pegged to the dollar broaden the re ach of U.S. monetary policy rather than dim inish it."
