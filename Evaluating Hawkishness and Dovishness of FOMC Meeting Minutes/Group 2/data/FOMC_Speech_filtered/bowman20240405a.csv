"E DT  April 5 , 202 4         Risks and Uncertainty in Monetary Policy:  Current and Past Considerations     Remarks by   Michelle W."
"Bowman   Member    Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at  “Frameworks for Monetary Policy, Regulation, and Bank Capital”  Spring 2024 Meeting of the Shadow Open Market Committee, hosted by  the Manhattan Institute   New York, New York         April 5 , 2024   Thank you for the invitation to speak to the Shadow Open Market Committee  (SOMC) .1  The SOMC  has a distinguished  reputation  for fostering substantive  analysis and debate  regarding independent, transparent, and systematic approaches to  central bank polic ymaking ."
 It’s a pleasure to join you today and to discuss  some of the current issues  facin g central banks and monetary policymakers .
"  In my remarks today, I will review  some of the notable developments in the U.S. econom y and financial system —as well as  review key monetary policy actions and communications —since I joined the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve  System and became a permanent voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)  in late November 2018."
 I will also highlight some considerations regarding financial stability risks and monetary policy .
" I will conclude with my own views on the near -term economic outlook, some of the prominent risks and uncertainties surrounding my outlook, and my views on the implications for monetary policy."
     Setting Monetary Policy amid a Wide Range of Uncertainties and Risks  An omni -present  challenge monetary policymakers  face is how to account for uncertainties surrounding the current state of the economy and the economic outlook  when setting monetary policy .
" Macroeconomic models  that can help guide the setting of monetary policy  often invoke unobservable concepts  such as the natural rate of unemployment , potential output , or the neutral real interest rate ."
" Despite these challenges, monetary policymaking requires a forward -looking approach, since its actions affect the economy, labor markets, and inflation with a lag.2    The post–financial crisis economy and monetary policy at the zero lower bound  When I joined the FOMC in late 2018 , despite nearly a decade of accommodative monetary policy following the financial crisis and subsequent recession, one of the primary concerns was that inflation had persistently been running slightly below  the Committee’s 2 percent inflation target."
" There was a recognition that the “natural rate of unemployment ” may have been lower t han many on the FOMC had estimated , and that inflation may have become  2 Greenspan (2004), Bernanke (2007), and Powell (2018) offer discussions of how risk and uncertainty may influence monetary policy in practice."

  - 3 -  less responsive to reductions in the unemployment rate.3  This recognition meant that preemptive increases in the federal funds rate based on expected reductions in the unemployment rate alone may not have been needed to keep inflation and inflation expectations aligned with the Committee’s 2  percent target.
  A central topic of FOMC meeting discussion s throughout 2019  was how monetary policy strategies and tools could best achieve the Committee’s dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment when  structurally low interest rates and disinflationary forces kept inflation persistently  under the Committee’s inflation  target.
" There was also a concern that the federal funds rate, the FOMC’s key policy rate, was too close to the “ zero lower bound .”  And that this proximity c ould limit the Committee’s ability to respond effectively to an adverse shock by using our primary monetary policy tool of lowering the target range for the federal funds rate."
" More broadly, many central banks around the world were grappling with the prospect of structurally lower interest rates due to a variety of fac tors, including demographic changes and higher savings rates, lower potential output and productivity growth, and greater investor demand for safe assets like Treasury securities."
"  At the time, t he FOMC assessed that downward  risks to both employment and inflation were likely to remain prominent due to  the proximity of interest rates to the zero lower bound ."
" In August 2020, t he FOMC significantly revised its Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy to reflect this assessment.4  A notable change relative to the initial  3 For example, the range of estimates of the longer -run level of the unemployment rate in the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) in March 2013  was 5.0 to 6.0 percent."
" In the most recent (March 2024 ) SEP, the range of estimates of the longer -run unemployment rate was 3.7 to 4.3 percent."
"Powell (2020), “ New Economic Challenges and the Fed’s Monetary Policy Review ,” speech delivered at “Navigating the Decade Ahead:  Implications for  - 4 -  statement  adopted in 2012  was a change in the language addressing  how the FOMC would conduct  monetary policy ."
" The new statement noted that the Committee would seek “to mitigate shortfalls  [emphasis added]” —rather than “deviations” —“of employment from the Committee’s assessment of its maximum level and deviations of inflation from its longer -run goal.”5  By replacing the word “deviations” with “shortfalls” when describing employment and the  Committee’s react ion to changes in employment relative to estimates of its maximum level, the Committee indicated that it would not act preemptively to curb inflation based  only on the perception of labor market tightness ."
"    Another notable change to the strategy statement was the adoption of what  some refer to as “asymmetric flexible average inflation targeting”  or “temporary price level targeting.”6  Specifically , the new statement noted that “ in order to anchor longer -term inflation expectations at [its 2 percent goal] , the Committee seeks to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time, and therefore judges that, following periods when inflation has been running persistently  Monetary Policy,” a symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, held in Jackson Hole, Wyo."

"  5 See the most recent Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, available on the Board’s website at  https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_LongerRunGoals.pdf  (quoted text in paragraph 5) ."
 Previous versions of the statement had noted that the Committee would seek to mitigate “deviations of inflation from its longer -run goal and deviations  [emphasis added] of employment from the Committee’s assessments of its maximum level ” (paragraph 5).
"  For a more detailed look at the changes in the 2020 strategy statement relative to the earlier statement first adopted in 2012, see Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2021), “Review of Monetary Policy Strategy, Tools, and Communications,” w ebpage, https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/guide -tochanges -instatement -onlonger -rungoals -monetary -policy -strategy.htm ."
"- 5 -  below 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time."
"”7 The revisions to the  FOMC’s statement focused on monetary policy in a world of structurally low interest rates, disinflationary forces, and an apparent insensitivity of inflation to low levels of unemployment."
"  Although the revised statement reaffirmed  the commitment to the Committee’s inflation target, it did not describe  how the Committee  would respond if inflation were to run persistently above  its 2 percent goal.8       Given the timing of its implementation, t he revised strategy guided how the FOMC responded to one of the largest shocks experienced by the U.S. economy in recent years —the COVID -19 pandemic."
  This shock —combined with the policy responses of governments and central banks around  the world —disrupted many of the dynamics that had influenced the economy over the previous several decades and the post –2008 financial crisis approach to monetary policy.
" These impacts will affect how we think about monetary policy g oing forward, but let’s first put the COVID -19 event and response into better context."
"  The C OVID -19 shock and monetary policy response  Toward the latter part of the FOMC’s monetary policy framework review, in March 2020, the COVID -19 pandemic created an unprecedented shock to the global economy and financial system."
" Widespread economic lockdowns and social distancing , combined with other pandemic effects, caused the swiftest and deepest contraction in employment and economic activity since the Great Depression."
" Many critical parts of the U.S. financial system experienced  7 See the latest Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, in note [5] (quoted  text in paragraph  4)."
"8 The statement did note that if the Committee’s employment and inflation objectives were no longer complementary , the Committee would take into account both employment shortfalls and inflation deviations as well as the time horizons over which employment and inflation were projected to return to levels judged consistent with its mandate ."
" L ater, the purchases provided additional monetary policy accommodation to support economic activity and labor markets.9  Following the return to the zero lower bound, i n addition  to conducting asset  purchases , the FOMC used forward guidance to provide additional monetary policy accommodation to keep  both short - and longer -term interest rates low ."
" In its March 15, 2020 , statement, the FOMC noted that it expected to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent “until it [was]  confident that the economy [had] weathered recent events and [was]  on track to achieve its maximum employment and price stabi lity goals."
 - 7 -  Committee ’s assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.
"”11  In its December 2020 post -meeting statement , the FOMC added forward guidance regarding its asset purchases by noting  that it expected that the  current pace of asset purchases would continue until “ substantial further progress has been made toward the Committee ’s maximum employment and price stability goals .”12        This explicit outcome -based forward guidance, like the revised monetary policy framework, was very focused on supporting the economy following the COVID -19 shock amid  the risks of persistently low inflation and disinflationary forces with structurally low interest rates."
"  - 8 -  The postpandemic economy, the resurgence of inflation, and the rapid tightening in monetary  policy  In the early phases of the pandemic, fiscal authorities around the world implemented support programs for labor markets and households and businesses.14  These generous policies, combined with very accommodative monetary policies, bolstered private -sector and state and local government balance sheets."
" Strong demand (supported by stimulative fiscal and monetary policies), a reduced labor supply (due in part to early retirements, childcare responsibilities, and concerns about COVID -19), and a mismatch between available jobs and workers all contributed to a very tight labor market."
"  The unusually rapid rebound in economic activity, pandemic -driven shift to consumer goods spending , supply chain fragilities, and manufacturing component  shortag es led to crippling bottlenecks for a number of industries ."
" These supply  and demand imbalances , likely amplified by fiscal and monetary policies, led to a sharp rise in inflation  over a period of just a few months ."
"By the second half of 2021, inflationary pressures intensified and became more broad - based."
" Labor markets were extremely tight, though it was difficult to assess the true extent of tightness, given the decrease  in labor force participation  and mixed data signals at the time ,  14 In the U.S., fiscal programs and policies included stimulus checks, expanded unemployment insurance, the Paycheck Protection Program , and other CARES Act (Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act ) and ARP Act (American Rescue Plan Act) programs designed to support businesses, households, and state and local governments."
"  Of the many  difficult issues the Committee faced, one of the most important was whether inflation would persist or would resolve as supply -side issues eventually eased."
"  The September 2021 Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) showed the median FOMC expectation for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation of 4.2 percent at the end of 2021 , largely reflecting high inflation readings in the first half of 2021 ."
" But for year -end 2022, the median expectation was for  PCE inflation to decline to  2.2 percent."
"15  Private -sector forecasters expected higher inflation of 5.1 percent at year -end 2021 but also projected a slowing to just over 2 percent by the end of 2022.16  With the benefit of hindsight, we now know that most forecasters, ourselves included, vastly misjudged the persistence of inflation at that time, with 5.9 percent PCE inflation for both 2021 and 2022."
 This example underscores  the challenge we faced in identifying which factors were driving inflation and how long those forces would persist.
" In the second half of 2021, it became clear that the FOMC’s monetary policy stance was too accommodative in the presence of growing inflationary pressures and that the Committee needed to move toward a tighter policy stance."
" It seems likely to me that the  experience of the years leading up to the pandemic, when inflation was persistently low, made it hard for many to foresee how quickly that situation could change ."
" Of course, the inflation and labor  data did not accurately reflect the economic conditions  prevailing at the time  and were subsequently  15 See the SEP released following the September 2021 FOMC meeting, which is available on the Board’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm ."
" - 10 -  substantially revised .17  Together, these factors , combined with the FOMC’s forward guidance  discussed earlier,  contributed to  a delay in the removal of monetary policy accommodation in 2021."
"  The shift in the Committee’s forward guidance toward the end of 2021 and in early 2022 was effective in moving longer -dated interest rates higher and in tightening financial conditions , even before the FOMC raised the federal funds rate .18  At our November 2021 meeting, we announced that we would begin to slow the pace of purchases later that month ."
" And in May, the FOMC announced its plan to reduce the size of the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings —which then stood at around $8.5 trillion —starting in June and at a pace much faster than in the previous episode of balance sheet reduction.19  The FOMC also continued to increase the target range for the federal funds rate over the course of 2022 at a pace much faster than in previous tightening cycles, as it became clear that inflation was higher and more persistent than many forecasters had ex pected."
"     17 For example, both the August and September 2021 employment reports suggested much lower job growth than did consensus forecasts , and these initial estimates were subsequently sizably increased."
" Similarly, total PCE inflation for nearly all quarters in 2021 has been revised higher than initially reported."

" - 11 -  The monetary policy experience during the pande mic highlights how difficult it can be to assess the current state of the economy and to predict how it will evolve in the presence of major supply - and demand -side shocks, possible structural changes in the economy, and real -time data and measurement uncertainty ."
"  Separate tools for monetary policy and financial stability   We know that monetary policy transmission is most effective during periods of stable financial conditions, and that financial stability risks , if realized,  can affect the economic outlook ."
" While monetary policy and financial stability are connected , financial stability vulnerabilities and risks are most appropriately  addressed  using macro - and micro -prudential regulation  and bank  supervision ."
" Of course, where risks impact  the outlook for economic activity, employment , and inflation, a monetary policy response may also be required."
" When appropriately calibrated, they can help promote market functioning  and the effective transmission of monetary policy  but limit the Federal Reserve’s overall footprint in financial markets in the longer term."
"   - 12 -  distinguish ing monetary policy actions from  temporary central bank asset purchase programs used to promote core financial market functioning , like those created to support Treasury markets  in the spring of 2020 .21      More recently , the bank failures last spring  highlight  that responsive, efficient, and effective bank supervision is a strong mitigant for financial system risks and vulnerabilities."
" If the supervisory process fails to identify and escalate critical risks, or to hold management accountable for known deficiencies, like excess interest rate risk and disproportionately large levels of uninsured deposits , this raises the potential for safety and soundness concerns ."
" While some changes to the regulatory framework may be appropriate to promote financial stability, we should be cautious  that these changes do not impair the long -term viability of banks, especially mid -sized and smaller banks.24  In my view, regulatory reform can pose significant financial stability risks, particularly if those regulatory changes fail to take sufficient account of the incentive effects and potential consequences, like  pushing activity into the more opaque nonbank financial sector.25  Poorly calibrated r egulatory actions can also negatively affect  economic activity and reduce  the availability of credit by limiting the  offering of  other financial products or services."
Basel III proposal meet this standard of being efficient and appropriately targeted .26  What’s Next for the Economy and Monetary Policy?
" Looking ahead , the FOMC will continue to face a number of risks and uncertainties as it seeks to return inflation to its 2 percent  goal."
  - 14 -  uncertainties and risks affect our monetary policy decisions  going forward .
" As this audience knows, members of the FOMC consult a range of models that consider several scenarios and their potential economic outcomes using different benchmark monetary policy rules.27  This type of analysis can provide helpful in put in  informing my own views on the appropriate  path of  monetary policy ."
" Given the importance of transparency, it is also necessary that our communications  explain  not only how the economic outlook affects  our monetary policy  decisions , often referred to as the FOMC’s “reaction function,”  but also how the risks and uncertainties surrounding the economic outlook  matter  for those decisions ."
"  With that in mind, I will conclude my remarks with my own views on the near -term economic outlook, including some prominent risks and uncertainties, and the implications for monetary policy."
" At its current setting, our monetary policy stance is restrictive and appears to be appropriately calibrated to reduce inflationary pressures."
 We have seen significant progress on lowering inflation over the past year while economic activity and the labor market have remained strong.
"  Consumer services spending has shown continued stre ngth through February, and payroll employment increased at a very strong pace in the first quarter."
"  However, most employment gains over the past year have been in part -time employment , and some of the recent strength in job gains  may reflect stronger labor supply due to increased  27 See, for example, the box “ Monetary Policy Rules in the Current Environment ” in Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2024), Monetary Policy Report  (Washington:  Board of Governors, March), pp."
"41 –43, https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/20240301_mprfullreport.pdf ; and Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland (2024), “Simple Monetary Policy Rules,” webpage, https://www.clevelandfed.org/indicators -anddata/simple -monetary -policy -rules ."
" The 12 -month readings of total and core PCE inflation through February printed at 2.5 and 2.8  percent , respectively, much lower than a year ago."
" However, with the annualized 3month PCE inflation readings moving well -above the 12 -month measures in February, I expect further progress in bringing inflation down to 2  percent will be slower this year."
" Still, my  baseline outlook continues to be that inflation will decline further with the policy rate held steady  at its current level, and that the labor market will remain strong but with labor demand and supply gradually rebalancing as the  number  of job openings relative to unemployed workers declines ."
" And s hould the incoming data continue to indicate that inflation is moving sustainably toward our 2 percent goal, it will eventually become appropriate to gradually lower the federal funds  rate to prevent m onetary policy from becoming overly restrictive."
"  However, we are still not yet at th e point  where it is appropriate to lower the policy rate, and I continue to see a number  of upside risks to inflation ."
"  First, much of the progress on inflation last year  was due to supply -side improvements, including  easing of  supply chain  constraints ; increases in the number of available workers , due in part to immigration ; and lower energy prices ."
 It is unclear whether further supply -side improvements will continue to lower inflation.
" For example, the rebound in labor productivity last year may have reflected an unwinding of temporary pandemic -related labor market dynamics, such as a slow ing in the high levels of employee turnover during th at time."
" Therefore, if wage gain s remain elevated going forward , these effects  may no  longer  contribute to lower price inflation  in the future ."
"  Geopolitical developments  could also pose upside risks to inflation , including the risk of spillovers from geopolitical conflicts and the extent to which food and energy markets and supply chains remain exposed to these influences."
 - 16 -  Another upside inflation  risk I see is from additional fiscal stimulus or a higher spend -out rate from existing and new appropriations.
" Although some of the recent policies may increase productive capacity in the medium term, they may add to inflationary pressures by boosting aggregate demand."
  I also see upside risks to housing services inflation.
 There  is also a risk that continued labor market tightness and continued strong services demand could lead to persistently high er core services inflation.
" Inflation readings over the past two months suggest progress may be uneven or slower going forwar d, especially for core services."
"  Finally, there is uncertainty regarding whether the federal funds rate will need to remain at a higher level than before the pandemic in order to effectively foster low and stable inflation and support full employment."
" In my view, given potential structural changes in the economy, like higher investment demand relative to available saving s, it is quite possible that the level of the federal funds rate consistent with low and stable inflation will be higher than before the pandemic."
" If that is the case, fe wer rate cuts w ill eventually be appropriate to return our monetary policy  stance  to a neutral  level ."
"- 17 -  While it is not my baseline outlook, I continue to see the risk that at a future meeting we may need to increase the policy rate further should progress on inflation stall or even reverse."
"  Given the risks  and uncertaint ies regarding my economic outlook, I will continue to watch the data closely as I assess the appropriate path of monetary policy , and I will remain cautious in my approach to considering future changes in the stance of policy ."
" Reducing our policy rate too soon or too quickly could result in  a rebound in inflation, requiring further future policy rate increases to return inflation to 2 percent over the longer run."
"   Closing Thoughts  To conclude, the experience over the past five years highlights the enduring challenge of setting forward -looking monetary policy amid a wide and evolving range of risks and uncertainties."
" Taking into account this experience and the lessons I have learned  over my tenure on the FOMC , an important question I will be considering  is how to make monetary policy strategy and its related communications durable to a wide range of possible shocks and changes in the macroeconomy."
 Restoring price stability is essential for achieving maximum employment  over the longer run.
