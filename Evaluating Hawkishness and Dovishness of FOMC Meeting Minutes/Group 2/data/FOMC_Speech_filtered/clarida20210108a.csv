"For release on delivery  11:00 a.m. EST January 8, 2021         U.S. Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy     Remarks by  Richard H."
" I look forward  to my conversation with Steve Liesman and to your questions, but first, please allow  me to offer a few remarks on the economic outlook, Federal Reserve monetary policy, and our new monetary policy framework ."
" Economic activity rebounded robustly in the third quarter and has continued to recover in the fourth quarter from its depressed s econd -quarter level, though the pace of improvement has moderated."
" Household spending on goods, especially durable goods, has been strong and has moved above its pre -pandemic level , supported in part by  federal stimulus payments and expanded unemployment benefits."
" Inflation, f ollowing large declines in the spring  of 2020, picked up over the summer but ha s leveled out more recently ; for those sectors that have been most adversely affected by the pandemic, price increases remain subdued."
"  - 2 - While gross domestic product growth in the fourth quarter downshift ed from the once -ina-century 33 percent  annualized rate of growth reported in the third quarter , it is clear that since the spring  of 2020, the economy has turned out to be more resilient in adapting  to the virus , and more responsive to monetary and fiscal policy support , than many predicted."
"  Indeed , it is worth highlighting that in the baseline projections of the Federal Ope n Market Committee (FOMC) summarized in the latest Summary of Economic Projections ( SEP) , most of my colleagues and I revised up our outlook for the economy over the medium term , projecting a relatively rapid return to levels of employment and inflation consistent with the Federal Reserve’s statutory mandate as compared with the recovery from the Global Financial Crisis (GFC).2  In particular, the median FOMC participant projects that by the end of 2023—a little less than three years from now —the unemploy ment rate will have fallen below 4  percent, and PCE (personal consumption expenditures) inflation will have returned to 2 percent."
"  Following the GFC, it took more than eight years for employment and inflation to return to similar mandate -consistent levels ."
" Although  a little mor e than half of participants judge d risks to be broadly balanced for economic activity, a similar number  continue d to see risks weighted to the downside for inflation."
" The Latest FOMC Decision and the New Monetary Policy  Framework    At our most recent FOMC meeting s, the Committee made important changes  to our policy statement that upgraded our forward guidance about the future path of the federal funds rate and asset purchases, and that  also provided unprecedented information about our policy reaction function."
" As announced in the September statement and reiterated in November and December, with inflation running persis tently below 2 percent, our policy will aim to achieve inflation out comes that keep inflation expectations well anchored at our 2 per cent longer -run goal.3  We expect to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomes —as well as our maximum -employment mandate —are achieved."
" W e also expect it will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessments of maximum employment , until  inflation has risen  to 2 percent , and until inflation is  on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time."
"   In addition, in the December statement, we combined our forward  guidance for the federal fund rate with enhanced , outcome -based guidance  about our asset purchase s."
 - 4 - We indicated that we will continue to increase our holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and our holdings of agency mortgage -backed securities by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward our maximum -employment and price -stability goals.
"   The changes to the policy statement that we made over the fall bring our policy guidance in line with the new framework outlined in the  revised Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy St rategy that the Committee approved last August.4  In our new framework, we acknowledg e that  policy decisions going forward will be based on the FOMC’s estimates of “shortfalls  [emphasis added] of employment from its maximum level” —not “deviations .”  This language means that going forward, a low unemployment rate, in and of itself, will not be sufficient to trigger a tightening of monetary policy absent any evidence from other indicators that inflation is at risk of moving above mandate -consistent le vels."
" With regard to our  price -stability mandate, while the new statement maintains our definition that the longer -run goal for inflation is 2 percent, it elevates the importance—and the challenge —of keeping inflation expectations well anchored  at 2 percent  in a world  in which an effective -lower -bound constraint is, in downturns, binding  on the federal funds rate."
"  To this end, the new statement conveys the Committee’s judgment that, in order  to anchor expectations at the 2 percent  level consistent with pr ice stability , it “seeks to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time,” and —in the same sentence —that therefore “following periods when inflation has been running persistently below 2  percent, appropriate monetary policy will                                                 4 The statement is available on the Board’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/review -ofmonetary -policy -strategy -tools -andcommunications -statementon -longer -rungoals-monetary -policy -strategy.htm ."
"  - 5 - likely aim to achiev e inflation moderately above 2  percent for some time.”  As Chair Powell  indicated in his Jackson Hole remarks, we think of our new framework as an evolution from “flexible inflation targeting” to “flexible average inflation targeting.”5  While this new fra mework represents a robust evolution in our monetary policy strategy, this strategy is in service to the dual -mandate goals of monetary policy assigned to the Federal Reserve by the Congress —maximum employment and price stability —which remain  unchanged .6 Concluding Remarks  While our interest rate and balance sheet tools are providing powerful support  to the economy and will continue to do so as the recovery progresses , it will take some time for economic activity and employment to return to levels that prevail ed at the business cycle peak reached last February."
