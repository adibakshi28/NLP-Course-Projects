"For release on delivery  6:00 p.m. EST November 12, 20 15         The Transmission of Exchange Rate Changes to Output and Inflation    Remarks by   Stanley Fischer   Vice Chair man  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at  “Monetary Policy  Implementation and Transmission in the Post -Crisis Period ,”  a conference sponsored by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   Washington, D.C.         November 12, 2015   Good evening."
" My discussion tonight  will focus on a key transmission channel in an open economy--the exchange rate .1  The exchange rate is a primary focus of central bankers in small open economies as well as a prime concern of the broader public  in those economies --and, to a lesser extent, in even the la rgest of economies ."
" When I was governor  of the Bank of Israel prior to joining the Federal Reserve, my markets screen was continuously open at a chart of the exchange rate of the shekel against the dollar."
" For small open economies, the exchange rate may well matter as much for output and inflation as do interest rates .2 Given that the U.S. economy is much less open than Israel’s, it is not surprising that fluctuations in the dollar typically receive somewhat less attention here in the United States ."
 My remarks will focus on the consequence s of the dollar’s ascent since last summer for U.S. output and inflation --and thus for monetary policy.
"2 At times, starting in the 1990s, several central banks --most prominently, the Bank of Canada --have used a monetary conditions index , generally a weighted average of changes in a short -term interest rate and a multilateral exchange rate from some baseline,  as a policy indicator."
" First, while the U.S. economy has performed re latively well--as is visible especially in our steady progress toward  full employment --major foreign economies have generally experienced weak growth , along with persistently low inflation."
" Because foreign central banks responded appropriately by providing additional monetary accommodation, foreign interest rates have declined relative to U.S. interest rates, encouraging investors to shift into dollar -denominated assets and in turn boosting the dollar."
 But widening interest rate differentials can explain  only part of the dollar’s large ascent.
"    Effects of a Stronger Dollar on U.S. Activity and Inflation  In considering the transmission of changes in the dollar’s value to U.S. output and inflation , it will be convenient f or illustrative purposes to focus on the effects of a 10 percent appreciation that is assumed to be permanent --and then to draw on this analysis to provide some guidance on how the dollar’s rise since mid -2014 has played out."
" Nevertheless, an extensive literature has found that the degree of pass -through of exchange rate changes to U.S. import prices is low, as  foreign exporters prefer to keep the dollar price of the goods they sell in the U.S. market relatively constant."
" For example, a typical estimate is that an appreciation of the dollar of 10 percent causes U.S. non -oil import prices to fall only about 3 pe rcent after a year and only slightly more thereafter.6  The low exchange rate passthrough helps account for the more modest estimated response of U.S. real imports to a 10 percent exchange rate                                                    4 The results presented here are taken from the staff’s U.S. International Transactions (USIT) model of the U.S. external sector."
"  In interpreting these estimated effects on GDP, it is important to underscore that the estimates do not take account of any offset due to monetary policy easing --a key consideration that I will discuss short ly."
" Even so, recalling that the dollar’s actual appreciation has been about 15 percent, the model estimates suggest that the cumulative reduction in U.S. aggregate demand from the dollar’s appreciation is likely to total almost  21/2 percent of GDP after three years --in the absence of policy action to boost private demand or government spending."
" Lookin g forward, given that the effects of the stronger dollar play through gradually to the economy, there is good reason to expect that the drag on GDP growth from the stronger dollar will persist well into next year and likely spell c ontinued weakness in the traded -goods -producing sectors of the economy that are especially exposed to the exchange rate."
" Indeed, the more export -oriented manufacturing sector has already taken a hit during the past year and ha s experienced weaker growth than the broader economy."
"  Turning now to inflation , consumer  price inflation has been running well below the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target, and the strong dollar has played an appreciable  role in this shortfall."
 One way in which the stronger dollar depresses inflation is by putting downward pressure on import prices.
" Figure 4 uses an econometric model discussed in  a recent speech by Chair Yellen  to illustrate how a 10 percent  appreciatio n of the dollar might play through to core personal consumption expenditures ( PCE) inflation , which excludes the more volatile food and energy components .8  This particular model implies that core PCE inflation dips about 0.5 percent in the two quarters following the appreciation before gradually returning to baseline,  which is consistent with a four -quarter decline in core PCE inflation of about 0.3 percent in the first year following the shock."
" While the Board staff use s a range of models to gauge the effect of shocks, the model employed in figure 4 --as well as other models used by staff --suggest s that the dollar’s large appreciation will  probably depress core PCE inflation between                                                    8 This econometric model is described in the appendix to Yellen (2015) ."
"  Thus, given that core PCE inflation is running around 1 -1/4 percent on a fourquarter -change  basis, the stronger dollar has played a material role in holding core PCE inflation below 2 percent."
  A second channel through which dollar appreciation reduces inflation is by increasing economic slack.
" Greater slack amplifies the downward pressure on inflation, although the quantitative effect is probably fairly modest given the flat slope of the Phillips curve."
" Because the pa ssthrough of dollar appreciation to oil and food commodity prices is much higher than for most imports, dollar appreciation tends to depress  overall PCE inflation by even more than it depresses core inflation."
   An important difference between the transm ission of dollar appreciation to inflation compared with output is that the effects on inflation are probably more transient.
" In particular, given that most of the effect on inflation occurs through changes in import prices --and import prices respond quic kly to the exchange rate --the peak effect on inflation probably occurs within a few quarters."
" From the standpoint of the outlook, this  transience  means that some of the forces holding down inflation in 2015-- particularly those due to a stronger dollar and  lower energy prices --will begin to fade next year."
" Consequently, overall PCE inflation is likely  on this account alone  to rebound next year to around 1½ percent."
" And as long as inflation expectations remain well anchored, both core and overall inflation  are likely to rise gradually toward 2  percent over the medium term as the labor market improves further and the transitory effects of declines in energy and import prices dissipate."
"  - 7 - U.S. Monetary Policy and the Dollar  The stronger dollar and some of the factors causing it, including weaker foreign demand, have played an important role in accounting for revisions to the expected path of U.S. policy rates compared with what was expected in the summer of last year."
" The forecasts made by Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) participants on a quarterly basis, which are published in the Summary of Economic Projections  (SEP),  provide a good indication of the extent to which forecasts for inflation, output growth, and the federal funds rate have changed since the  summer of 2014."
" The June 2014 SEP showed U.S. GDP growth centered at roughly 3 percent in 2015 and core inflation running around 13/4 percent, and the median participant projected that  the appropriate level of the federal funds rate at the end of 2015 w ould be 1 -1/4 percent before rising to 2 -1/2 percent at the end of 2016.9  But in the most recent SEP following the September 2015 FOMC meeting, the median participant saw GDP growth at only 2 percent this year, core inflation at 1 -1/2  percent, and the federal funds rate below 1/2  percent at the end of 2015 before rising to only 1 -1/2 percent at the end of 2016.10   This greater degree of monetary accommodation seems appropriate given the adverse effects on U.S. aggregate demand coming from the rise in the dollar, an associated weakening of foreign economic prospects, and other developments that have restrained spending and kept inflation undesirably low."
" Monetary policy easing helps through “crowding in”  domestic demand, which  in turn helps boost price inflation and makes it less likely that inflation expectations drift below our 2 percent target."
" - 8 - The Board staff’s g eneral -equilibrium models that take explicit account of the ability of monetary policy to crowd in domestic demand-- including the staff’s FRB/US and multicountry  SIGMA models --suggest that monetary policy easing can substantially mitigate the effects of ad verse shocks on GDP, including from the recent runup in the dollar."
" In the case of the dollar shock considered previously, these models suggest that the all -in effects of the stronger dollar on GDP are only about onehalf to two -thirds  as large as implie d by the trade model that abstracts from a monetary policy response --still substantial,  to be sure, but much less significant for the economy than if monetary policy failed to play an active role."
 Monetary policy has played a key rol e in achieving these outcomes through deferring liftoff relative to what was expected a little over a year ago.
" The October 2015 FOMC statement indicated that it may be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate at the next meeting i n December, though the outcome will depend on the Committee’s assessment of the progress --realized and expected --that has been made toward meeting our goals of maximum employment and price stability.11  Of course, as policymakers , we must always be vigilant to events unfolding differently than we expect, and we must be ready to react accordingly ."
