"For release on delivery  1:30 p.m. EST February  27, 20 15         Conducting Monetary Policy with a Large Balance Sheet     Remarks by   Stanley Fischer   Vice Chair man  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at the  2015 U.S. Monetary Policy Forum  Sponsored by the University of Chicago Booth School of Business   New York, New York         February  27, 20 15   Thank you."
 It is a great pleasure to be here to discuss some of the important issues facing the Federal Reserve and other central banks in conducting monetary policy with a large balance sheet.
" Early in  the crisis, this strategy seemed  to help bolster confidence that the Fed was acting aggressively to offset  the tightening in credit conditions and the steep downturn in economic activity."
" As shown in f igure 3, a recent study  estimates that the QE programs along with increasingly explicit forward guidance have reduced the unemployment rate by 1 -1/4 percentage points and increased the inflation rate by 1/2  percentage point relative to what would have occurred in the absence 2 The estimates shown in figure 2 are based on an extension of  the work done in Ihrig, Klee, Li, Schulte, and Wei (2012)."

" Among these are the possibility that elevated securities holdings and low interest rates could pose risks to financial stability, possible effects on the Fed’s income and remittances to the U.S. Treasury , and possible difficulties in conducting policy normalization.4  Such potential difficulties arise because the level of reserve balances will be very high when the FOMC begins to raise the federal funds rate, and, consequently, the Federal Reserve will em ploy new tools, which have their own benefits and costs, to implement monetary policy."
"  Despite these potential costs, we think that asset purchases have had a meaningful effect in promoting economic recovery and helping to keep inflation closer to the FOMC’s 2  percent goal than would otherwise have been the case."
 We have  for some years  been considering ways to operate monetary policy with an elevated balance sheet.
"                                                    - 6 - Indeed, testing to dat e suggests that ON RRP operations have generally been successful in establishing a soft floor for money market interest rates.6 The Fed could also employ other tools, such as term deposits issued through the Term Deposit Facility  and term RRPs , to help drain reserves and put additional upward pressure on short -term interest rates."
   Conclusion I will close by highlighting that the Fed’s asset purchases have been a critical means by which the FOMC has provided policy accommodation at the zero lower  bound on nominal interest rates.
"  In other words, the Fed-- and other central banks --can implement an expansionary monetary policy even when the policy interest rate is at the 6 Policymakers  have discussed benefits and costs of an ON RRP facility."
