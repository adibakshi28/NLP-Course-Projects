 This was particularly the case for banks in states like Ca lifornia that were most heavily impacted by a sharp deterioration in real estate markets and a significant increase in unemployment.
" Many bankers have told me that they manage their loan portfolios to stay below thes e thresholds and forego growth in these loan categories, even when promising, creditworthy le nding prospects are available."
" Moreover, to generate loan volume without in creasing real estate lending, many banks are now targeting growth in commercial and industria l (C&I) loans, a type of lending with which they may have less expertise."
" The only expectations for smaller banks are those contained in ex isting guidance, such as for interest rate risk or for commercial real estate concentrations."
" But because community banks hold the loans on balance sheet, they may charge hi gher rates than those for prime GSE loans or include balloon payments to account for the liquidity  and interest rate risk  of holding the loans in portfolio."
 But it is difficult to make that distinction if regulatory requirements use the interest rate on the loan as a proxy to identify subprime loans.
