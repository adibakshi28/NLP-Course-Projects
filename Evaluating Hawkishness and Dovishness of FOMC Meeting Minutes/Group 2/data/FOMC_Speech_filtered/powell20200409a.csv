"Powell   Chair   Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at  Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy  The Brookings Institution   Washington, D.C.         April 9 , 2020    Good morning."
" We are moving with alarming speed from 50 -year lows in unemployment to what will likely be very high, although temporary, level s."
"  The Fed can also contribute in important ways:   by providing a measure of relief and s tability  during this period of constrained economic activity, and by using our tools to en sure that the eventual  recovery is as  vigorous as possible."
"  To those ends, w e have lowered interest rates  to near zero in order to bring down borrowing costs."
 We have also committed to keeping rates at this low level until we are confident that the economy has weathered the storm and is on track to achieve our maximum -employment and price -stability goals.
" When the economy is well on its way back to recovery, and private markets and institutions are once again  able to perform their vital function s of channeling credit and supporting economic growth, we will put these emergency tools aw ay."
