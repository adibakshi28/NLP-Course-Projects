"Quarles   Vice Chair man for Supervision   Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at  “Promoting Sustained Growth:  Policy Tensions and Risks ” 34th Annual NABE Economic Policy Conference    Washington, D.C.         February 26 , 2018   Thank you for the opportunity to take part in this important and influential conference.1  I would like to  discuss my view of current economic conditions in the United States, provide an  assessment of the sustainability of  the current momentum in the economy,  and then conclude with a look at some of the potential implications that would follow from a sustained  upturn in economic growth."
" Real gross do mestic product ( GDP ) growth through the final three quarters of 2017 averaged almost  3 percent, a considerable step -up over the 2 percent average annual pace recorded over the previous eight years."
" The sustainability of the recent upturn in growth will de pend importantly on whether some of the factors that have been holding back growth for the past decade diminish, including weak investment and productivity."
" In some cases, I believe the data look encouraging --for example, the recent strength of investment --but in others, less so, particularly the continued softness of productivity growth."
" On balance, I am cautious, but I am also optimistic enough to believe that the factors that have been holding back growth need not be permanent and could turn , even fairly rapidly ."
  What would be  the likely consequences if growth were to shift up on a sustained basis ?
 Here I think it will be important to consider and observe the form that higher growth takes.
" In particular, it matters  whether growth is embodied in a sustained increase in the productive capacity of the economy or , instead,  is primarily the product of a boost to aggregate demand."
 - 2 - for inflation and thus for how the stance of monetary po licy will respond to higher growth.
" The Fed eral Reserve  will, as always, seek to achieve its dual mandate of maximum employment and stable prices."
" After peaking at 10 percent in October 2009, the unemployment rate has declined to 4.1 percent, its lowest level s ince the 1960s outside of a brief period from 1999  to 2000."
" With the unemployment rate below most  estimates of its natural rate , wages appear to have accelerated  a little  of late after a period of relatively muted increases , and I expect a further modest stepup in the pace of wage gains ."
 The robust job market has likely spill ed over to other aspects of the economy.
" Consumer confidence has returned to pre -crisis levels, which, together with solid income gains and rising household wealth, has support ed strong growth in consumption expenditures."
" Real expenditures on capital equipment increased at a double -digit pace in the second half of last year, providing early hope that the investment drought that has weighed on growth in recent years might finally be breaking ."
  The recent upturn in growth has not been confin ed to the United States .
" In its latest  projection, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) forecasts global growth to run close to 4 percent in 2018, the fastest pace since the immediate post -crisis rebound  in  - 3 - 2010 and 2011.2  Even more notable is that the IMF has revised up global growth in its recent  projections."
"  Stronger foreign growth has in turn supported U.S. growth, with exports in 2017 growing at the fastest pace in four years."
  Inflation has run at a low and relatively stable rate throughout the crisis and the recovery.
" Recently, the low level of inflation has attracted considerable attention , as it continues to run on the soft side notwithstanding the apparent tightness of the labor market."
" Headline PCE (personal consumption expenditures) price s increased 1.7 percent in the 12 months ending in December, a few tenths of 1 percentage point below the Federal Open Market Committee’s ( FOMC ) 2 percent longer -run inflation objective."
 That inflation has remained low even as activity has picked up and t he labor market has tightened has led a number of commentators to question the relevance of the Phillips curve analytical framework that ties inflation to the strength of the economy.
" I tend to agree with the view that the recent softness of inflation mostly reflects idiosyncratic and transitory factors, and I expect inflation to move back  to 2 percent over the next year or so."
" Overall, I would characterize the recent weakness of inflation as something that should be expected to fade rather than as a n enduring  mystery that necessitates a change in our framework for assessing inflation."
 The question now is how persistent this step -up in growth will prove to be.
" In the FOMC’s most recent Summary of Economic Projections , released in December, growth was  expected to remain fairly solid in 2018  before moving down toward a longer -run rate of 1 -3/4 percent .3  I do not view this forecast  as particularly optimistic , but it is as reasonable as any other if one  conjectures that the factors that have held back growth in recent years will remai n in effect ."
" But now that the economy is coming off several quarters of relatively robust growth, I would like to examine the appropriate level of confidence in this conjecture and, in particular , identify what  we might look for if, in actuality,  some of the factors that have held back growth over the past decade begin  to dissipate."
" Before  doing so , let me first quickly review some of the most frequently cited explanations for the slow pace of growth in the post -crisis period."
 Why Has Growth Been So Slow through Much of the Postcrisis Period?
      Why has growth been so slow  over much of the past decade ?
" I will break down the explanations into two broad categories :  those  related to the lingering after -effects of the crisis --for example , increa sed uncertainty and precaution --and those that are more structural and less clearly linked to the crisis, such as demographics and low productivity growth."
 4 Reinhart  and Rogoff (2009) document the lasting effect that downturns related to a financial cris is can have on economic growth.
"  - 5 - aftermath of the most recent crisis, a n increase in consumer caution , along with a tightening of credit conditions, helped  boost  saving, leading to a necessary  deleveraging of househo lds, but at the expense of consumption growth."
"  As I mentioned earlier, investment has also been  noticeably weak in recent years, likely  reflect ing increased restraint on the part of businesses unsure of the outlook for demand and their profits."
"    Anothe r factor holding back U.S. growth has been repeated shocks to the global economy, sometimes amplified  by vulnerabilities growing out of the crisis."
" The effects of a number of these shocks have spilled over to the United States, including those stemming fr om the euro -area debt crisis as well as occasional concerns about the strength and durability of emerging market growth, especially  in China."
" These foreign developments  contributed to a 15 percent appreciation of the broad dollar since  mid2014, which, along with weak foreign economic activity, weighed on U.S. export growth."
 Concern over the strength of foreign demand also contributed to a steep decline in the price of oil at around the same time.
" Historically, lower oil prices have been a positive for U.S. growth, but the tremendous rise in  domestic shale oil production over the past decade has created a powerful counterweight that has offset some of the benefit of lower prices ."
" Regarding  structural explanatio ns for slow growth, demographics are likely playing  a role."
" In a development that predates the crisis, relatively flat  labor input, as measured by hours worked, has weighed  on growth."
  - 6 - Perhaps most important in explaining the growth slowdown has been the lackluster increase  of productivity in recent years.
" Labor productivity has averaged an annual growth rate of only 3/4 percent since 2011, far below the 2 -1/4 percent pace prevalent over the two decades leading into the financial crisis."
 Why has productivit y growth been so anemic?
"  One school of thought is that productivity growth has  not slowed down much at all; rather , new technolo gies and products have made economic output hard er to measure.6  It is not difficult to think of technological developments that have had a deep and pervasive effect on our daily lives (smartphone app s, for example) but perhaps in a manner that is difficul t to describe in the existing  vocabulary of economic statistics."
"7 Others argue a somewhat pessimistic view that the slowdown reflects a paucity of new inventions --or at least new inventions that lead to more rapid productivity growth.8   In a break with the easy dichotomy I offered earlier, others tie the slowdown in productivity growth more tightly to developments related to the aftermath of the financial crisis."
" Slow investment growth --which, as already mentioned , had prevailed until recently --damps the contrib ution of new capital to worker productivity."
 It could also be                                                  6 See Hatzius and others (2016) for an overview of some issues that new technologies and products may be introducing into the measurement of GDP and productivity .
 8 Gordon (2016) argues that recent technological advances have been relatively minor compared with the large advances that drove rapid increases in productivity in the past.
" Having laid out the standard explanations for the slow pace of growth, I will  now speculate on what a shift to a higher growth path  might look like and what I think we may want to watch for."
" After subtracting from growth over much of the period from 2011 onward, the impetus from fiscal policy has turned distinctly positive with the passage of recent tax and budget legislation.10  Fiscal policy is likely to impart considerabl e momentum to growth over the next couple of years not only by increasing demand , but also by boosting, to some degree, the potential capacity of the economy."
" Of course , while stimulative in the near run, deficit spending --and the associated large and grow ing federal government debt --can have negative effects on the economy  over the longer term , in part by claiming a larger share of the nation’s savings, driving up longterm interest rates , and crowding out productive private investment."
" 10 For a his torical measure of the fiscal policy’s contribution to GDP growth , see the Hutchins Center Fiscal Impact Measure , available on the Brookings Institution website at  https://www.brookings.edu/interactives/hutchins -center -fiscal -impact -measure ."
 - 8 - How about the other factors that have been holding back growth?
" Looking at the data, I see encouraging signs that some drags may be lessening --for example , the recent pickup in investment --but less  promising indicators elsewhere, especially productivity growth."
" Given long -standing demographic trends , it would seem a heavy lift to expect  labor force growth to contribute much to a pickup in  GDP growth."
 Productivity .
" Though the quarterly numbers are volatile and should be treated cautiously, the nearly 1 percent declin e in labor productivity recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 would imply that a productivity turnaround is not yet upon us."
" Moreover, for 2017 as a whole, productivity increased only 3/4 percent, about the same as the average annual pace since 2011."
" Th at said, with no consensus on what has caused the productivity slowdown, a turnaround could come suddenly."
"   - 9 - There are those who argue a more optimistic take on the prospects for technology  developments  to boost productivity growth.11  For example, a number  of new technologies, including artificial intelligence and genetic sequencing, appear  on the cusp of breaking out , with widespread effects on economic activity.12 Also, it might be true that productivity growth will be nudged  higher by the pace of economic  activity."
" With global growth picking up steam, the external environment is more favorable for U.S. growth than it has been in q uite some time."
"  In 2017 , for example, the contribution of real exports to growth picked up markedly following two years in which exports provided no support to growth at all."
          What Are the Consequences of Higher Growth?
" Again , I think it is too s oon to call a turning point in the long -run growth prospects of the economy, notwithstanding some encouraging signs that I have highlighted."
"    One consequence might be that a sustained increase in growth could be associated with an increase in the natural rate of interest, a concept that has developed a prominent position in the lexicon of central banking in recent years."
"  12 Brynjol fsson, Rock, and Syverson (2017) argue that lags in the adoption of new technology could explain the paradox between apparent advances in technology and continued weak productivity growth."
  - 10 - employment .
" In the eyes of many commentators, t hat inflation has remained so low through  the post -crisis period even as interest rates have fallen to levels that historically would have been very stimulative to the economy suggests that the natural rate has fallen ."
" There are a number of compelling narratives, including low productivity growth, demographic trends, increased uncertainty , and a higher demand for precautionary saving."
" If these narratives sound familiar , it is because they are more or less the same set of explanations put forward as rea sons for  the slow pace of growth in recent years."
" Thus, a lessening  of any of these factors, such as  a sustained increase in the pace of productivity growth, would  likely push up the natural rate of interest  as well as GDP growth ."
" It is important t o point out that this higher policy path would be motivated by sustained stronger growth and improved economic conditions , not a greater desire to slow the economy ."
" In addition to its value in signaling  that the economy is doing better, a higher rate could facilitate  the conduct of monetary policy."
 A lower natural rate of interest can complicate the operation of conventional monetary policy.
" Since it is difficult to cut nominal interest rat es below zero, c onventional monetary policy is more likely to be  constrained at low levels of the natural interest rate."
" The higher the natural interest rate, the more space central banks  - 11 - have to cut policy rates in response to an economic downturn , easin g the conduct of conventional policy ."
" I also think there is a real possibility that some of the factors that have been holding back growt h in recent years could shift, moving the economy onto a higher growth trajectory."
" Importantly, we have not yet seen any sustained pickup in productivity growth ."
" However, given that conditions could shift, it is fair to ask what a higher growth path might mean."
" As I discussed, it could mean a higher natural interest rate, which would increase the amount of accommodation provided at a given  level of the Federal Reserve’s policy interest rate."
" In assessing the effect of higher growth on monetary policy, I will be carefully watching how that growth aligns with our dual mandate."
 It might seem reasonable to assume that faster growth would lead to firmer inflation.
" For one, the degree to which growth spurs inflation is likely to be determined by the underlying factors that are prompting the increase in gr owth."
 A demand -led increase can be expected  to have a greater positi ve effect  on prices than a step -up in the pace of potential growth.
" Growth led by an increase  - 12 - in the economy’s productive capacity, either through increased labor force participation or higher productivity growth, is likely to impart less upward pressure on prices ."
"  I will be carefully watching indicators of economic activity and inflation and assess ing the degree to which activity appears to be pushing up against  the constraints of the economy , as opposed to being a reflection of the expansion of those constraint s and the growth of the potential output of the economy."
" At our January meeting, the FOMC decided to maintain its target range for the federal funds rate between 1 -1/4 and 1 -1/2 percent.13  In this range, monetary policy remains accommodative."
" With my cur rent economic outlook, I anticipate that further gradual increases in the policy rate will be appropriate to both sustain a healthy labor market and stabilize inflation around our 2 percent objective."
" Of course, as I mentioned,  I will keep a close eye on economic indicators --and their implications for the outlook for inflation and real activity --and adjust my views on the appropriate monetary policy accordingly."
