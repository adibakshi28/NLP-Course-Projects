"  A strong labor market that is sustained for an extended period can deliver substantial economic and social benefits, including higher employment and income  levels, improved and expanded job opportunities, narrow er economic disparities, and healing of the entrenched  damage inflicted by past recessions on individuals’ economic and personal well -being ."
" The overall unemployment rate was 3.5 percent, the lowest level in a halfcentury ."
 The unemployment rate for African Americans had also reached historical lows ( figure  1).
" Prime -age labor force participation was the highest in over a decade, and a high proportion of households saw jobs as “plentiful.”1  Overall wage growth was moderate, but wages were rising more rapidly for earners on the lower end of the scale ."
" In  fact, in 2015, prime -age labor force participation —which I focus on because it is not significantly affected by  the aging of the population—reached its  lowest level in 30 years even as the unemployment rate declined to a relatively low 5 percent ."
" Given that U.S. labor force participation has lagged relative to other advanced economy nations , this progress was especially welcome (figure 3) .3    As I mentioned, we also saw f aster wage growth for low earners once the labor market ha d strengthened sufficiently."
" Nearly six years into the recovery, wage growth for the lowest earning quartile had been persistently modest and well below the pace enjoyed by other workers."
" - 3 - continued to strengthen, the trend reversed, with wage growth for the lowest quartile consistently and significantly exceed ing that of other workers  (figure  4)."
"  At the end of 2015, the Black unemployment rate was still quite elevated, at 9 percent, despite the relatively low overall unemployment rate."
" But that disparity too began to shrink; as the expansion continued beyond 2015, Black unemployment reached a historic low of 5.2 percent, and the gap between Black and white unemployment rates was the narrowest since 1972, when data on unemployment by race started to be  collected ."
" Black unemployment has tended to rise more than o verall unemployment in recessions but also to fall more quickly in expansions.4  Over the course of a long expansion, these persistent disparities can decline  significantly , but, without policies to address their underlying causes,  they may increase again  when the economy ultimately turns down."
"   These late -breaking improvements in the labor market did not result in unwanted upward pressures on inflation, as might have been expected ; in fact, i nflation  did not even rise to 2 percent  on a sustained basis ."
 There was every reason to expect that the labor market c ould have strengthened  even further without causing a worrisome increase in inflation were  it not for the onset of the pandemic .
"Stock and Janice Eberly, eds., Brookings Papers on Economic Activity  (Washington:  Brookings Institution Pres s, Spring), pp."
" Employment in January of this year was  nearly 10 million below its  February 2020 level, a greater shortfall than the worst of  the Great Recession ’s aftermath  (figure 5) ."
"After rising to 14.8 percent in April  of last year , the published unemployment rate has f allen relatively swiftly , reach ing 6.3 percent in January ."
 But  published unemployment rates during COVID have dramatically understated the deterioration in the labor market.
" Most  importantly, the pandemic  has led t o the largest 12 -month decline  in labor force participation  since at least 1948.5  Fear of the virus an d the disappearance of employment opportunities in the sectors most affected by it, such as  restaurants , hotels, and entertainment  venues, have led many to withdraw from the workforce."
 Correcting this misclassification and c ounting those who have left the labor force since last February as unemployed  would boost the unemployment rate to close to 10  percent in  January (figure  6).
 Aggregate employment has                                                  5 Published monthly data on labor force participation begin in 1948.
" Moreover, employment for these workers has changed little in recent months, while e mployment for the higher -wage groups has continued to improve."
" Similarly, the unemployment r ates for Blacks and Hispanics have risen significantly more than for whites  since February 2020 ( figure  8)."
 Extended periods of unemployment can inflict persistent damage on lives and livelihoods  while also eroding the productive capac ity of the economy.6  And w e know from the previous expansion that it can take many years to reverse the  damage.
"Romer and Justin Wolfers, eds., Brookings Papers on Economic Activity  (Washington:  Brookings Institution Press , Fall ), pp."
" - 6 - At the start of the pandemic , the increase in unemployment was almost entirely due to temporary job loss es.7  Temporarily laid -off workers tend to  return to work much more quickly, on average, than those whose ties to their former employer s are permanently severed."
 So too has long -term un employment.
" Of course, in a  healthy market -based economy, perpetual churn will always render  some jobs obsolete as they are  replaced by new employment opportunities ."
"  8 For research on the effect of the Paycheck Protection Program on employment, see David Autor , David Cho, Leland D."
 Experience tells us that get ting to and staying at full employment  will not be  easy .
  Also important is a patie ntly accommodative  monetary policy stance that embraces the lessons of the past —about the labor market in particular and the economy more generally.
 I also noted that these benefits were achieved with low inflation.
" Indeed, inflation has been much lower and more stable over the past three decades than in earlier times."
" In addition, we  have  seen  that the longer -run potential growth rate of the economy appear s to be lower than it once was, in part because of  population aging, and that the neutral rate of interest— or the rate consistent with the economy being at full employment with 2  percent inflation —is also much lower than before."

"  To take these economic developments into account, we made  substantial revisions to our monetary policy framework, as described in the FOMC’s S tatement on L onger -Run G oals and M onetary P olicy S trategy.11  This revised statement shares many features with its predecessor, including our view that longer -run inflation of 2  percent is most consistent with our mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability."
The revised statement emphasizes that maximum employment is a broad and inclusive goal.
" R ecognizing the economy’s ability to sustain a robust job market without causing an unwanted increase in  inflation, the statement says that ou r policy decisions will be informed by our “assessments of the shortfalls  of employment from its maximum level” rather than by “deviations  from its maximum level."
”12  This means that we will not tighten monetary policy solely in response to a strong labor market.
" Finally, to counter  the adverse economic dynamics that could ensue from declines in inflation expectations in an environment where our main policy tool is more frequently constrained, we now  explicitly  seek to achieve inflation that averages 2  percent over time."
"  This means that following periods when inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent,                                                  11 The FOMC’s Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, revised in August 2020 and reaffirmed in January,  is available on the Board’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_LongerRunGoals.pdf ."
 - 9 - appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time in the service of keeping inflation expectations well anchored at our 2 percent longer -run goal .
"Our January postmeeting statement on monetary policy implements  this new framework.13  In particular, we expect that it will be appropriate to maintain the current accommodative target range of the federal funds rate until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time."
" In addition, we will  continue to increase our holdings of Treasury securities and agency mortgage -backed securities by $80 billion and $40 billion per month, respectively, until substantial further progress has been made toward our maximum -employment and price -stability goals."
" The B road Responsibility for A chieving M aximum E mployment  Seventyfive years ago, in the wake of WWII, the U nited S tates faced the challenge of reemploying millions amid a major restructuring of the economy toward peacetime ends.14  Part of Congress ’s response was the Employment Act of 1946, which states that “it is the continuing policy and responsibility of the federal government to use all practicable means ."

 My colleagues and I are strongly committed to doing all we can to promote this employment goal.
"  Given the number of people who have lost their jobs and the likelihood that some will struggle to find work in the post -pandemic economy, achieving and sustaining maximum employment will require more than supportive monetary policy."
 Steady employment provides more than a regular paycheck.
" It also bestows a sense of purpose, improves mental health, increases lifespans, and benefits workers and their families.16  I am confident that with our collective efforts across the government and the private sector, our nation will make sustained progress toward our national goal of maximum employment."
