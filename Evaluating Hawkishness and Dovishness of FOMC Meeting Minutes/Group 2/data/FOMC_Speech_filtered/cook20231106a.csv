" Early in my career, I examined the impact of underdevelopment in the Russian banking system  on growth in post -Soviet Russia and the instability that can occur in a poorly regulated financial system."
" - 2 -  Achieving the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate of maximum employment and stable prices  depends on a stable financial system .2  We all saw  how the Global Financial Crisis triggered the Great Recession and brought misery to countless millions  who lost their jobs, homes, or investments."
" One hard -learned lesson of the crisis is that the Fed and  2 See the Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, which is available on the Board’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomc_longerrungoals.pdf ."
"  In particular , prices  of residential and commercial properties remain above levels  4 See the box “Vulnerabilities from Asset Valuations, Risk Appetite, and Low Interest Rates” in Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2021 ), Financial Stability Report (Washington:  Board of Governors, May), pp."
 I am watching closely the extent to  which post -pandemic supply and demand patterns normalize.
" Demand in the office sector has remained weak, particularly in central business districts and coastal cities, with vacancy rates increasing fu rther and rent growth declining."
" Such stresses can propagate through the financial system, causing funding shortages that curtail credit and hamper economic activity."
" However, measures of the ability of firms to service their debt remain  strong overall , supported by resilient corporate profits and limited effects to date from higher interest rates ."
" The pass -through of higher interest rates into debt -servicing costs appear s to be muted by the large share of longterm, fixed -rate liabilities."
" However, I note that for  risky borrowers or those with highyield or unrated debt , the ability to service their debt burdens has started to show signs of weakness, as would be expected in a rising interest  rate environment , and could become further strained if corporate earnings fall due to a sharper -thanexpected slowdown in economic activity."
" When financial  institutions are overly indebted, adverse shocks can cause them to retrench more than they otherwise would, resulting in greater declines in economic activity."
"  The rise in interest rates over the past two years has contributed to robust bank profitability , as banks earned higher interest income on floatingrate loans while interest expense on many deposits remained well below market rates."
"  At the same time, higher longterm interest rates also substantially affected the fair value of banks’ holdings of fixed -rate assets ."
" As we saw earlier this year, fair value losses on bank balance sheets , when combined with poor liquidity and interest rate risk management, can leave banks exposed to additional risk ."
" I wi ll walk through how potential nearterm risks could interact with current conditions in the United States , based in part on the regular outreach survey the Federal Reserve Bank of New York  conducts to inform the discussion in the FSR.6  In recent outreach, as summarized in  this figure from the FSR , contacts were particularly focused on the persistent inflationary pressures leading to further monetary tightening,  6 See the box “Survey of Salient Risks to Financial Stability” in Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2023), Financial Stability Report (Washington:  Board of Governors, October ), pp."
 Market participants and others remain attentive to the possible effects of higher interest rates on the financial sector.
" At the same time, vulnerabilities at certain NBFIs could play a key role in amplifying stress associated with tightening financial conditions and slowing economic activity."
