 The rapid growth in securitization and derivatives markets prior to the crisis provides a stark example of this phenomenon.
 Growth in notional amounts of CDOs is indicative of the growth in economic exposure.
"   - 3 - contracts increased tenfold , from $6 trillion to $60 trillion.5  This incredible growth in securitization and derivatives markets reflects a significant increase in the number, type s, and complexity of network connections in the finan cial system."
 Economists take a we llreasoned and dim view of autarky as the path to growth and stability.
" Banks and other financial intermediar ies channel capital from savers, who often have  short -term liquidity demands, into productive invest ments that typically require stable, long -term funding."
" Notional amounts do not reflect the economic exposure in these markets, which is a small fraction of the notional value, but the growth noted here is  indicative of the growth in exposure."
" Of course, “complexity” is difficult to define in a completely systematic and satisfact ory manner, but one way emphasized in recent work by Hyun Song Shin is to consider the number of links required to connect savers to borrowers.10  Shin’s analysis of interconnectedness among financial institutions is based on the idea that the ultimate amou nt of lending and borrowing that can occur in an economy is determined by economic fundamentals such as income growth, which change only slowly over time, whereas interbank claims can grow or contract far more quickly."
"  The International Monetar y Fund estimates that one -third of interest rate and credit derivatives and two -thirds of equity, commodity , and foreign exchange derivatives will not be suited to standardization and will remain non -centrally cleared.18  As more -standardized derivatives mi grate to central clearing, it will be important to remain vigilant in managing the risks from non -centrally -cleared derivative s exposures.19  One important tool for managing the systemic risks of non -centrally -cleared derivatives is margin requirements.20  Globally, regulators have been working on standards for margin requirements on non -centrally -cleared                                                  18 See International Monetary Fund (2010)."
" 19 For example, parti cipants and their supervisors will need to closely monitor the risk positions flowing from non -centrally -cleared derivatives to ensure that removing centrally cleared derivatives from existing bilateral netting arrangements will not inadvertently lead to s ignificant growth in risk concentrations from noncentrally -cleared derivatives."
" But as the bonds it had insured continued to fall in value and AIG was further downgraded, it faced increasing and ultimately insurmountable collateral demands from its derivatives c ounterparties ."
" Moreover, while market integrity and appropriate co nfidentiality are important considerations, the events of the financial crisis have clearly shown that effective systemic risk management demands more , and not less , data disclosure."
" A lesson from that episode, as relevant today as it was then, was that financial stability is essential to sustained economic growth and prosperity."
