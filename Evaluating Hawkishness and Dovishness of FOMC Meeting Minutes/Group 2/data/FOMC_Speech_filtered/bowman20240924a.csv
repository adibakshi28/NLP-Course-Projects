"For release on delivery  9:00 a.m. EDT  September 24 , 2024         Recent Views on Monetary Policy  and the Economic Outlook    Remarks by   Michelle W."
 I  would like to thank the Kentucky Bankers  Association for the invitation to join you t oday for your annual convention.1  I appreciate the opportunity to share my views on the U.S. economy and monetary policy before we engage on  community banking issues and other matters affecting  the banking industry.
" In light of last week’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting , I will begin my remarks by providing some perspective on my vote and  will then share my current views on the economy and monetary policy."
" Update on the Most Recent FOMC Meeting  In order to address high inflation, for more than two years, the FOMC  increased and held the federal fund s rate at a restrictive level ."
" I agreed with the Committee’s assessment  that, given the progress we have seen since the middle of 2023 on both lowering inflation and cooling the labor market,  it was  appropriate to reflect this progress by recalibrat ing the level of the federal funds rate and begin the process of moving toward a more neutral stance of policy."
" - 2 -  notes , I preferred  a smaller initial cut in the policy rate while  the U.S. economy remain s strong and inflation remains  a concern , despite  recent progress."
" Economic Conditions and Outlook  In recent months , we have seen some further progress on slowing the pac e of inflation , with monthly readings lower than the elevated pace seen in the first three months of the y ear."
" The 12month measure of core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation, which provide s a broader perspective t han the more volatile higher -frequency readings, ha s moved down since April, although i t came in at 2.6 percent in Ju ly, again remaining well  above our 2 percent  goal ."
" In addition, the latest consumer and producer price index r eports suggest  that 12month core PCE inflation in August was likely a touch above  the July reading."
" The persistently high core inflation largely reflects pressures on housing prices, perhaps due in part to low inventories of affordable housing."
" The progress in lowering inflation since April is a welcome development, but core inflation is still uncomfortably above the Committee’s 2  percent goal."
 Prices for these spending categories have far outpaced overall inflation over the past few years.
 Economic growth moderated earlier this year after coming in stronger  last year.
" Private domestic final purchases (PDFP) growth has been  solid and slowed much less than gross domestic product (GDP), as the slowdown in GDP growth was partly driven by volatile categories includin g net exports, suggesting that underlying economic growth was stronger than - 3 -  GDP indicated."
"The most recent  labor market report shows that p ayroll employment gains have slowed appreciably to a pace moderately above 100,000 per month over the three months ending in August ."
 The unemployment rate edged down to 4.2 percent in August  from 4.3 percent in July.
" While unemployment is notably higher than a year ago, it is still a t a historically low level  and below my and the Congressional Budget Office’s estimate s of full employment."
" Although wage growth has slow ed further in recent months , it remain s indicative of a tight labor market."
" A t just under 4 percent , as measured by both the employment cost index and - 4 -  average hourly earnings , wage gains are still  above the pace consistent with our inflation goal  given trend productivity growth."
"The rise in the unemployment rate this year largely reflects weaker hiring, as job seekers entering or re -entering the labor force are taking longer to find work, while layoffs remain low."
" In addition to some cooling in labor demand, there are other factors likely contri buting the increased unemployment."
" A  mismatch between the skills of the new workers and available jobs could further raise unemployment, suggesting that higher unemployment has been partly driven by the stronger supply of workers."
" It is a lso likely that some temporary factors contributed to the recent rise in the unemployment rate , as unemployment among working age teenagers  sharply increased  in August ."
Preference for a More Measured Recalibration of Policy  The U.S. economy remains strong and  core inflation remains uncomfortably above our 2 percent target .
" If this expectation had materialized , we could have see n an unwarranted decline in longer -term interest rate s and broader financial conditions  could become overly accommodative ."
 This  outcome  could work against the Committee’s goal of returning inflation to our 2 percent target.
" Third, there continues to be a considerable amount of pent -up demand and cash on the sidelines ready to be deployed as the path of interest rates move s down."
 Bringing the policy rate down too quickly carries the risk of unleashing that pent -up demand.
A more measured  approach would also avoid unnecessarily stoking demand and potentially reigniting inflationary pressures.
" Ongoing Risks to the Outlook  Turning to the risks to achieving our dual mandate, I continue to see greater risks to price stability, especially while the labor market continues to be near  estimates of full employment."
"  Although the labor market data have been showing signs of cooling in recent months , stillelevated wage growth, solid consumer spending, and resilient GDP growth are not consistent - 6 -  with a material economic weakening or fragility."
" Therefore, I am taking less signal from the recent labor market data until there are clear trends indicating that both spending growth and the labor market  have materially weaken ed."
" In my view, the upside risks to inflation remain prominent."
" Global supply chains continue to be susceptible to labor strikes and increased geopolitical tensions, which could result in inflationary effects on food, energy, and other commodity markets."
" Expansionary fiscal spending could also lead to inflation ary risks , as could an increased demand for housing given the long -standing limited supply, especially of affordable housing."
" W hile it has  not been my baseline outlook, I cannot rule out the risk that progress on inflation could continue to stall."
"  Although it is important to recognize that there has been meaningful progress on lowering inflation, while core inflation remains around or above 2.5 percent, I see the risk that the Committee’s larger policy action could be interpreted as a premature declara tion of victory on our price -stability mandate."
  Accomplishing our mission of returning to low and stable inflation at our 2 percent goal is necessary to foster a strong labor market and an economy that works for everyone in the longer term.
"In light of these conside rations, I believe that , by moving at a measured pace toward a more neutral policy stance , we will be better positioned  to achieve further progress in bringing - 7 -  inflation down to our 2 percent target , while closely watching the evolution of labor market conditions ."
 I remain committed to working together with my colleagues to ensure that monetary policy is appropriately positioned to achieve our goals of attaining maximum employment and returning inflation to our 2 percent target.
" I will continue to monitor the incoming data and information as I assess the appropriate path of monetary policy , and I will remain cautious in my approach to adjust ing the stance of  policy going forward."
  It is important to  note that monetary policy is not on a preset course.
 My colleagues and I will make our decisions at each FOMC meeting based on the incoming data and the implications for and risks to the outlook guided by the Fed’s dual -mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices.
  We need to ensure that the public understands  clearly how current and expected deviations  of inflation and employment from our mandated goals inform our policy decisions.
" By the time of our next meeting in Novembe r, we will have received updated reports on inflation , employment , and economic activity."
 We may also have a better understanding of  how developments in longer -term interest rates and  broader financial conditions might influence the economic outlook.
" Durin g the intermeeting period, I  will continue to visit with a broad range of contacts to discuss economic conditions as I assess the appropriateness of our monetary policy stance."
" As I noted earlier, I continue to view inflation as a concern ."
 My view continues to be that restoring price stability is essential for achieving maximum employment over the longer run.
" However, should the data evolve in a way that points to a  material weaken ing in the labor market, I would support  taking action and adjust monetary policy  as needed  while taking int o account our inflation manda te."
 It is a pleasure to  join you and to have the opportunity to discuss  my views on the economy and monetary policy.
