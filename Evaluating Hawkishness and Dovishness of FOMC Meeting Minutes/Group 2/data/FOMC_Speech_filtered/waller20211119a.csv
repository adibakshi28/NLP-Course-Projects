" Let me take the next several minutes to speak about the continued improvement of the U.S.  economy, recent inflation data , and their implications for monetary policy.1  I will also discuss  the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC)  recent decision to begin reducing monthly purchases of securities  and how incoming data may affect the pace of tapering."
" Since I last spoke on the subject  exactly a month ag o, the basic shape of my outlook has n’t changed: T he economy continues to grow and add jobs at a strong pace, making steady progress toward the Federal Reserve’s goal of maximum employment."
 New data show s that employment gains were bett er than first reported in August and September and were  back to a strong level in October .
" Due to a combining of those supply constraints with strong demand, inflation pressures are becoming more widespread and may last longer into  2022 than I thought they would."
" These factors haven’t dented my optimism that the strong recovery will continue  but they have raised the risks that supply constraints may limit job gains and output growth, and that inflation may complicate the FOMC’s  management of monetary policy in 2022."
" These factors weighed on output growth in the third quarter , which was down considerably from the three months before but which I expect  will rise  again to a  strong rate in the fourth quarter."
" Assuming another damaging COVID19 variant does not arise this winter, I expect  gross domestic product ( GDP ) to resume its robust growth not only in the fourth quarter of 2021 but also in the first half of 2022."
" In terms of the job market, households and businesses perceive that conditions  are as tight as or tighter than they were pre -COVID, even though the unemployment rate is more than a percentage point higher."
 The improvement I expect in managing COVID should drive demand higher but also provide a boost to labor supply as those who  have been on the sideline s return to a job market that keeps improving .
"With respect to  employment  data , revisions to the August and September job numbers indicated that the summer slowdown in job gains wasn’t nearly as bad as initial reports suggested."
" Regarding the unemployment rate, in October  the rate stood at  - 3 - 4.6 percent."
" If the decline continues at about that pace in coming months, the unemployment rate could  be below 4 percent before too long."
" In light of these data, i n my view , the labor market is rapidly approaching maximum employment ."
"  Turning to inflation, inflation has escalated substantially this year , along with a significant rise in inflation expectations."
 The October c onsumer price index  report showed a n unexpected surge in inflation .
" Despite the highest wage gains in years, inflation this year has wiped out any real wage increase for the average worker."
 H igh inflation is  painful to Americans who have little  choice about the  goods and services they buy for everyday living.
" Even trimmed mean measures of inflation  that exclude some big price  increases, such as the Cleveland Fed and the Dallas Fed measures, report inflation rates above the Fed’s 2 percent target ."
" - 4 - of categories with 3 or 12month inflation exceeding 3 percent, compared with earlier this year."
"  I expect that these pressures are related to both supply constraints , which may be beginning to improve, and  strong demand, w hich shows no sign of abating."
 Crucial to the path of inflation will be whether we see input cost increases consistently reflected in final goods prices.
" It has been  argued that because price pressures connected to supply constraints are transitory, they will come to an end , so monetary policy does not need to respond to tempora ry price pressures."
" Second, the macroeconomic models we use to guide policy typically have cost shocks built in that cause inflation to move."
" In those models, appropriate monetary policy responds to these inflation movements ; it doesn’t ignore them, even though they are transitory."
" To me, the inflation data are starting to look a lot more like a big snowfall that will stay on the ground for a while , and that development is affect ing my expectations of the level of monetary accommodation that is needed going forward."
 Inflation expectations on the part of the public also play a role in the conduct of monetary policy.
" Two surveys of consumers —by the University of Michigan and the New York Fed —show medium inflation expectations running over 4 percent, and bond investors are  requiring over 3 percent compensation for future inflation and inflation risks."
  It is very concerning to me that households  and markets are no longer expecting us to keep inflation near our 2 percent target over the next three to five years.
" Now, it i s true that there is some evidence that these consumer survey measures of future inflation tend to move around a lot based on changes in current inflation."
 So I hope these large movements in inflation expectations are —wait for it— transitory and will come back down as bottlenecks and labor shortages resolve themselves over the coming months.
" But i f these measures were to continue moving upward, I would become concerned that expectations would lead households to demand higher wages to compensate for expecte d inflation , which could raise inflation in the near term and keep it elevated for some time."
 This possibility is a risk to the inflation outlook that I’m watching carefully.
"So, what are the implications of all these considerations for monetary policy?"
" If COVID or some other factor substantially slows the recovery, hindering the progress toward maximum employment, the FOMC could slow the taper."
" But if the economy makes quick progress toward maximum employment  or inflation data show no signs of retreating from their currently high readings, the Committee may ch oose to  speed up the taper, which would position it to accelerate subsequent steps in tightening monetary policy if necessary."
" The timing of any policy action is a decision for the FOMC, but for my part  the rapid improvement in the labor market and the deteriorating inflation data ha ve pushed me towards favoring a faster pace of tapering and a more rapid removal of accommodation in  2022."
" They are when the economy has reached maximum employment, and when inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time."
" Assuming  - 7 - inflation expectations are wellanchored, I judge that the timing of liftoff is any time after  both of these conditions have been met."
  I believe  the condition for inflation has been met  and we are making great strides towards achieving the employment leg of our mandate.
" After th at point, w henever  the Committee ultimately decides to  raise the target range for the federal funds rate from zero, monetary policy will still be providing an extraordinary extent of support for the economy—short -term interest rates will still be very low , and the large amount of  securities holdings on the Fed’s balance sheet will continue to put significant downward pressure on longer -term interest rates."
 It is important to remember that the FOMC makes monetary policy decisions with the best interest of the American people in mind and not based on how these actions affect the balance sheet.
" The standing repurchase agreement facility  provides a backstop in cases where demand  for liquidity is  3 In June 2019, the median of the respondents to the Survey of Primary Dealers indicated a $1.2 trillion level of reserve balances in 2025."
"  4 Against a backdrop of declining reserves and high levels of Treasury securities outstanding, in mid -September 2019, imbalances in the supply of and demand for short -term funding led to pressures in the repurchase agreement (repo) market."
 Then the Fed will turn to normalizing other aspects of monetary policy as the economy continues to recover from the severe COVID shock we e ncountered last year.
