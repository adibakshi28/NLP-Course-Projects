" Before doing so, I will share  my views on the economy and monetary policy in the United States."
" Update on the E conomy and M onetary P olicy Outlook  Over the past two years, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has significantly tightened the stance of monetary policy to address high inflation."
"  After seeing considerable progress on slowing inflation last year, we have seen only modest further progress this year."
" The 12month measures of total and core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation have moved roughly sideways or slightly down since December and remained elevated at 2.7 percent and 2.8 percent, respectively, in April."
 The  consumer price index (CPI) report for May showed 12 -month core CPI inflation slowing to 3.4 percent from 3.6 percent in April.
" However, with average core CPI  inflation this year through May running at an annualized rate of 3.8 percent, notably above average inflation in the second half of last year, I expect inflation to remain elevated for some time."
"  The recent pickup in inflation in the first several months of 2024 was evident across many goods and services categories, suggesting that inflation was temporarily lower in the latter  1  The views expressed here are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee or the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System."
" Inflation has hit lowerincome households hardest since food, energy, and housing services price increases far outpaced overall inflat ion throughout this episode."
Economic activity increased at a strong pace last year but appears to have moderated early this year.
" Firstquarter gross domestic product growth was slower than in the second half of last year, though private domestic final purchases continued to rise at  a solid pace."
 Continued softness in consumer spending and weaker housing activity early in the second quarter also suggest less momentum in economic activity so far this year.
" Payroll employment continued to rise at a solid pace in April and May, though slightly slower than in the first quarter, partly reflecting increased immigrant labor supply."
" Despite some further rebalancing between supply and demand, the labor market remai ns tight."
" The unemployment rate edged up to 4.0 percent in May, while the number of job openings relative to unemployed workers declined further to near its pre -pandemic level."
"  At its current setting, our monetary policy stance appears to be restrictive, and I will continue to monitor the incoming data to assess whether monetary policy is sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to our target."
" As I’ve noted recently, my baseline outlook continues to be that inflation will decline further with the policy rate held steady."
" And should the incoming data indicate that inflation is moving sustainably toward our 2 percent goal, it will eventually become appropriate to gradually lower the target range for the federal funds rate to prevent monetary policy from becoming overly restrictive."
" However, we are still not yet at the - 3 -  point where it is appropriate to lower the policy rate, and I continue to see a number of upside risks to inflation."
"  First, much of the progress on inflation last year was due to supplyside improvements, including easing of supply chain constraints; increases in the number of available workers, due in part to immigration; and lower energy prices."
" It is unlikely that fu rther improvements along this margin will continue to lower inflation going forward as supply chains have largely normalized; the labor force participation rate has leveled off in recent months below pre -pandemic levels; and an open U.S. immigration policy over the past few years, which added millions of new immigrants in the U.S., may become more restrictive."
"  Geopolitical developments could also pose upside risks to inflation, including the risk that spillovers from regional conflicts could disrupt global supply chains, putting additional upward pressure on food, energy, and commodity prices."
" There is also the  risk that the loosening in financial conditions since late last year, reflecting considerable gains in equity valuations, and additional fiscal stimulus could add momentum to demand, stalling any further progress or even causing inflation to reaccelerate."
"   Finally, there is a risk that increased immigration and continued labor market tightness could lead to persistently high core services inflation."
" With labor markets remaining tight, wage growth has been elevated at around or above 4 percent, still higher than the pace consistent with our 2 percent i nflation goal , given trend productivity growth."
"  In light of these risks, and the general uncertainty regarding the economic outlook, I will continue to watch the data closely as I assess the appropriate path of monetary policy."
  It is important to note that monetary policy is not on a preset course.
" I n my view , we should consider a range of possible scenarios that could unfold when considering how the FOMC’s monetary policy decisions may evolve."
" While the current stance of monetary policy appears to be at a restrictive level, I remain willing to raise the target range for the federal fund s rate at a future meeting should the incoming data indicate that progress on inflation has stalled or reversed."
 Restoring price stability is essential for achieving maximum employment over the longer run.
