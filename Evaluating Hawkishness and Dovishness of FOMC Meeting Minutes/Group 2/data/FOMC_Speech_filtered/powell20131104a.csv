"E ST (8:40 a.m.  PST ) November 4, 2013            Advanced Economy Monetary Policy and Emerging Market Economies     Remarks by   Jerome H."
"Powell   Member   Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at  Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco 2013 Asia Economic Policy Conference:  Prospects for Asia and the Global Economy    San Francisco, California         November 4, 2013    I appreciate this opportunity to offer a few thoughts on the effects of advanced econo my monetary policies on emerging market economies  (EMEs) --an issue of great importance for Asia and the global economy.1  Since the global financial crisis, the Federal Reserve has sought to strengthen the U.S. economic recovery through highly accommodativ e monetary policy."
"  In recent years, renewed attention has been  placed on the role of  advanced economies and of common or global factors in driving capital movements .3  In particular, many observers have singled out monetary policy in the United States and other advanced economies as a key driver."
"  In my remarks today, I will discuss  the extent to which monetary policy in the advanced economies --and in the United States in particular --has contributed to changes in emerging market capital flows and asset prices, and I will place this discussion in a broader context of economic and fina ncial linkages among  economies."
 I will also address the risks that EMEs may face from the eventual normalization of monetary policy in the advanced economies .
" In the United States, the Federal Reserve is bound by its dual mandate to pursue price stability and maximum employment."
" By lowering private -sector expectations for the future path of shortterm rates, forward guidance has reduce d longer -term interest rates and raise d asset prices, thereby leading to more accommodative financial conditions."
" The second tool is large scale asset purchases, which likewise  increase policy accommodation by  redu cing longer -term interest rates and raising asset prices."
" The ECB  also purchased some securities in distressed markets , and recently indicated that it expects interest rates to remain low for an extended peri od."
" While a great deal of attention has focused on unconventional policy actions, especially asset purchases, these policies appear to affect financial conditions and the real economy in much the same way as conventional interest rate policy."
" Moreover, neither conventional nor unconventional monetary policy actions are shocks that c ome out of the blue."
"  Thus, any spillovers from monetary policy actions must be evaluated against the consequences of failing to r espond to these adverse shocks."
 R ecent research by Federal Reserve Board staff finds that reductions in U.S. interes t rates for any reason --whether caused by monetary policy or other factors --have typically been associated with declines in EME interest rates and appreciation of EME currencies.
" Spillovers from advancedeconomy monetary polic ies are to be ex pected.5  In theory, when advanced economies ease monetary policy  in response to a contractionary shock, their interest rates will decline, prompting investors to rebalance their portfolios toward higher -yielding assets."
" Conversely, a tightening of ad vanced  economy  monetary policy  in response to a stronger economy  should lead these movements to reverse; that is, tightening should reduce capital flows to EMEs and diminish upward pressure on EME currencies and asset prices."
" If interest rates were the main driver of capital flows, these two series ought to move in a similar fashion ."
" At times , this is indeed the case:  From mid -2009 to early 2011, the interest rate differential and EME capital inflows rose together."
" And in mid -2011, capital inflows stepped down even as the interest rate differential remained elevated."
"  - 5 - a moment, th e lack of a tight relationship between capital flows and interest rates suggests that othe r factors also have been important."
" In a similar vein, event stu dies have shown that the Federal Reserve’s policy announcements, including those related to asset purchases, have been associated with capital flows to EMEs as well as upward movements in EME currencies and asset prices.7  But  the role of monetary policy i n driving capital flows and the effects of those flows on EMEs should not be overstated."
"First,  many factors affect capital flows to EMEs, not just the stance of advanced economy monetary policy."
 Differences in growth prospects across countries and the associated differences in expected investment returns  are important factors .8  Chart 2 shows the growth rate of real GDP for EMEs and advanced economies.
" As shown by the line in the right panel, EME growth has , in fact, consistently outpaced that of the advanced economies."
 - 6 - although the  gap has diminished more recently as growth in the EMEs has slowed.
" Moreover, investing in EMEs has become more attractive as many EMEs have improved their macroeconomic policies and institutional frameworks over recent decades ; growth differentials may partly be reflecting these improvements ."
" As is evident in the right -hand chart, the relationship between the growth differential and capital inflows to EMEs seems to be quite strong."
" In particular , the rise in capital flows following the global financial crisis  coincided with stronger relative growth performance in EMEs ."
" And in 2011, capital inflows diminished along with the growth differential."
" Of course, movements in risk sentiment may not be  fully  independent of monetary policy."
 An interesting line of research has begun to consider how changes in monetary policy itself may affect risk sentiment.
" For example, some studies indicate that an easing of U.S. monetary policy tends to lower volatility  (as measured by the VIX), increase leverage of financial intermediar ies, and boost EME capital inflows and currencies.10                                                  9 See Ahmed and Zlate (2013),  Bluedorn and others (2013),  Forbes and Warnock (2012), and IMF (2011)."
"  - 7 - A second  point to bear in mind when assessing monetary policy spillovers is that expansionary policies in the advanced economies are not beggar -thyneighbor; in other words, they do not undermine exports from EMEs.  In recent decades, some EMEs have successfully p ursued an export -led growth strategy, and policymakers in those economies have sometimes expressed concern  that their exports will be unduly restrained as accommodative policies in the advanced economies lead  their currencies to appreciate."
" However, as sh own in c hart 4, although EME currencies bounced back from their lows during the global financial crisis --when global investors fled from assets they perceived to be risky --for many EMEs real exchange rates have moved sideways or have even declined over the  past two years."
"  But even if advanced economy monetary policies were to put upward pressure on EME currencies, the consequent drag on their exports must be weighed against the positive effects of stronger demand in the advanced economies."
"  Over the longer run, advanced economy policy actions that strengthen global growth and global trade will benefit the EMEs  as well."
" Credit growth in China is particularly noteworthy, but this does not seem to be the result of accommodative monetary policies in the advanced economies."
" In addition, China’s relatively closed capital account limits the extent to which domestic credit conditions are influenced by developments abroad, including changes in advanced economy monetary policy."
 - 9 - significant degree by policy actions to support aggregate demand.
 Chart 7  displays inflation -adjusted house prices for several Asian economies.
" The most striking increases have occurred in Hong Kong, which, through its  open capital account and essentially fixed exchange rate, is tied most directly to U.S. financial conditions."
" But , as with credit growth, this rise seems to reflect domestic developments as opposed to spillovers from global financial conditions."
" Moreover, expansionary m onetary policies in the advanced economies have supported global growth to the benefit of advanced and emerging economies alike."
" As shown in chart 8, f rom May through August, U.S. Treasury yields rose substantially as market participants reassessed the future course of U.S.  monetary policy."
 The magnitude of these market responses may have been amplified by the carry -trade strategies that many investors had in place; these strategies were designed to take advantage of interest rate differentials and appeared profitable as long as EME interest rate differentials rem ained wide and EME exchange rates remained stable or were expected to appreciate.
" When anticipations of Fed tapering led to higher U.S. interest rates and higher market volatility, these trades may have been quickly unwound, engendering particularly sharp declines in EME exchange rates and asset prices."
"   These developments, however, do not appear to have been driven solely by perceptions of U.S. monetary policy."
" As I noted earlier, GDP growth in many EMEs has fallen from the pace of previous years, which may have led investors to rethink their  - 11 - investment choices."
" Asset prices have fallen considerably more in economi es with large current account deficits, high inflation, and fiscal problems than in countries with stronger fundamentals."
" For example, as shown in c hart 9, changes in EME exchange rates and interest rates since April have been correlated with current acco unt deficits."
"  In general, economies with larger current account deficits experienced greater depreciations of their currencies and larger increases in their bond yields."
" Thus, while a reassessment of U.S. monetary policy may have triggered the recent ret renchment from EMEs, investor concerns about underlying vulnerabilities appear to have amplified the reaction."
" Whatever their source, large capital outflows from EMEs can pose challenges for EME policymakers by simultaneously producing significant currency  depreciation, asset price deflation, and inflationary pressures."
" In such cases, EME central banks are in the difficult position of judging whether to tighten policy at the same time that demand is weakening."
"  Monetary policy in the United States is likely to remain highly accommodative for some time, as our economy fights to overcome the remaining headwinds from the global financial crisis."
"  While moderating the pace of purchases and the eventual increase in the federal funds rate may well affect capital flows , interest rates and asset prices in EMEs , the overall macroeconomic effects need not be disruptive."
" First, tightening will in all likelihood occur in the context of a more firmly established economic recovery  in the United States  so that any adver se effects on EME financial conditions should be buffered by the beneficial effects of higher external demand ."
" Second, although conditions vary from country to country, on the whole , EMEs exhibit greater resilience than they did in prior decades, reflecti ng, among other factors , more flexible exchange rates, greater stocks of international reserves, stronger fiscal positions, and better regulated and more conservatively managed banking systems."
" EMEs have policy tools to help manage any negative externalit ies that may arise, and recent developments provide additional rationale for them to redouble their efforts to bolster their resiliency .14  Reducing vulnerabilities, improving policy frameworks, and safeguarding the financial sector will go a long way towar d making EMEs more robust to a wide range of shocks, not just those that may arise from changes in monetary policy in the advanced economies."
" In order for the Federal Reserve to fulfill its dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment, we must take account of these international linkages."
