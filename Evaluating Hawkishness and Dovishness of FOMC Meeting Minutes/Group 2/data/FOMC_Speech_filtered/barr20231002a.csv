"   For release on delivery  1:00 p.m. EDT   October 2 , 2023         Monetary Policy and Financial Stability     Remarks by   Michael S."
" I would like to talk with you today about the intersection of my two roles at the Federal Reserve  as the Vice Chair for Supervision  at the Federal Reserve Board  and as a member of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC ).1  In particular, I’ll focus on the interaction of monetary policy and financial stability policy."
"  Views on Monetary Policy and Current Conditions  First, my views on current monetary policy."
" I joined the FOMC last year at a time when the headline CPI inflation was peaking at about 9 percent , and we had begun our policy response."
" In August, t he 12month change in CPI inflation was about 3 ¾ percent."
 Our strong measures  have  ensured that inflation expectations remain  well anchored.
"   While inflation has been moderating, incoming data on economic activity ha ve shown considerably more resilience than I had expected."
    economy achieving a return to price stability without the degree of job losses that ha ve typically accompanied significant  monetary policy tightening cycles.
"Of course, the labor market is  tight and the data show that employment continued to expand through August, bu t incoming data also suggest we are  making progress on bringing labor demand and supply back into better balance ."
 Job growth has moderated  while  labor force participation has continue d to improve .
" My baseline projection is for real GDP growth to moderate to somewhat below its potential rate over the next year  as restrictive monetary policy and tighter financial conditions restrain economic activity, a nd I expect this below -trend growth will be associated with  some  further  softening in the labor market ."
  There is a robust debate about the lags of monetary policy transmission; how long it takes for past tightening to come into full effect.
" Given how far we have come, we are now at a point where we can proceed carefully  as we determine the extent of monetary policy restriction that is needed."
" Monetary Policy an d Financial Stability  Now let me turn to my focus today, which is the interaction of monetary policy and financial stabilit y."
" Monetary policy affects  the cost and quantity of credit in the economy, usually in a broad -based and gradual fashion."
" Both forces  have an effect  on economic activity, as the flow of credit  to businesses and households i s crucial  for spend ing, hiring, and production , underpinning  economic growth."
" For much of our subsequent histor y, however, the Federal Reserve tended to consider financial stability and monetary policy separately .3  That perspective changed  considerably  in the  years after the Global Financial Crisis , which  had many implications for how we think  2 As Paul Volcker put it 40 years ago when testifying as Federal Reserve Chair, “the Federal Reserve, like any central bank, has a continuing and abiding interest in  ."
" Financial Stability Considerations in a LowRate Environment   After the Global Financial Crisis , the Federal Reserve kept interest rates low  for years  to revive  a badly damaged economy ."
" Researchers , market participants,  and policymakers took note of the potential for very low interest rates to encourage investors to “reach for yield” —that is , to take increased risk in  pursuing higher returns on the ir investments ."
" This behavior can include taking on increased interest rate , credit, and  liquidity risk."
" In some ways, investor reach for yield is an indication that monetary policy is helping stimulate economic activity."
" As a result,  more people  get jobs as economic activity increases."
" But in that environment of record low interest rates, and with the ravages of the financial crisis a fresh memory, people rightly wondered whether the incentive  to reach for yield would drive excessive risk -taking, leading to a build up in vulnerabilities that could ultimately  threaten the stability of the  financial system  and the economy ."
" Were those risks so considerable that financial stability concerns should be taken into consideration in making monetary policy decisions?4  At the same time, some risk s were  4 Michael Woodford raised the issue in 2012 ; see Michael Woodford  (2012) , “Inflation Targeting and Financial Stability ,” NBER Working Paper Series 17967 (Cambridge, Mass.:  National Bureau of Economic Research, April ), https://www.nber.org/papers/w17967 ."
" Indeed, as thenGovernor Jeremy Stein famously pointed out , monetary policy “gets in all the cracks”  and therefore could push back against excessive risk -takin g, not only in banks, but  across the financial system .5  Despite these concerns, financial stability risks were contained until the pandemic."
" Financial Stability Consideration of Moving from Low Rates to Rising  Rates  The pandemic resulted in an unprecedented mismatch between demand and suppl y, both here and abroad , and th ese forces  were the initial impetus for high inflation."
The shift from an environment of generally low and slowly adjusting rates to the  rapid and near -simultaneous tightening of  monetary policy around the world that began last year set the stage for additional stresses in the financial system.
" This led to  widespread disruptions in the gi lt market last fall, requiring  the Bank of England  to  broac hed in 2013 by Narayana Kocherla kota and then dealt with more extensively in 2014 in speech es by Jeremy Stein and Janet Yellen ; see Narayana Kocherlakota (2013), “Low Real Interest Rates,” speech delivered at the 22nd Annual Hyman P."

"    undertake a temporary and targeted program of purchases of long -dated government bonds .6 Here in the U nited States, starting in 2022, the FOMC began a period of rapid and substantial increases in the federal funds target range to combat inflation  that was much too high."
" While most banks were well positioned to handle rate increases, higher  interest rates had a severe  effect on the balance sheets of banks that had not managed their interest rate risk  appropriately ."
" Indeed, one recent study looked at data for 46 countries over 150  years and found that  episodes of bank stre ss are frequently followed by  significant drops in bank lending and economic activity  that persist for many years .7  Despite the effectiveness of our response  to the March stress events , the question again arose whether monetary policy goals were in conflict with financial stability."
" Given these historical experience s, I think it is particularly important that we watch  closely how both monetary policy and the effects of the March banking stress are affecting bank behavior and the provision of credit to the economy ."
 And core loan growth appears to be relatively  stagna nt in banks of all sizes.
" While low loan growth can be explained  in part by weaker demand for loans in response to higher costs of credit, it is also driven in part by banks tightening their standards, as they reported they were doing in the past several releases of the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey  on Bank Lending Practices .8   As we continue  to track developments, we are also continu ing to learn from th is episode ."
    A stable financial system is a necessary condition for sustainably achieving the FOMC’s monetary  policy goals of maximum employment and stable prices.
 The safety and sound ness of the  banking sector is paramount in achieving both our monetary policy and financial st ability goals.

"  And t hird, there is some evidence that monetary policy can affect financial vulnerabilities."
" While t here is some agreement among researchers  about how monetary policy can affect the accumulation of financial vulnerabilities , there is more debate about  whether monetary policy decisionmaking should be affected by concerns about financial stability ."
" One view is that  there is often a discernable tradeoff between the objectives of monetary policy and financial stability, and that monetary policy decisions should consider the consequences for the stability  of the financial system.11  Another view is that there should be a strict separation of monetary policy and financial stability  policy ."

" For example, Ben Bernanke , Don Kohn, and Lars Svensson, among others,  have argued that the likely costs of using monetary policy to addr ess financial stability risks outweigh the benefits .12  My view is somewhere in the middle  of these two perspectives ."
 Correctly calibrating monetary policy  to target a  financial vulnerability specific to one part of the financial system is likely not possible .
" Moreover, a monetary policy  response , even to a broad -based search for yield , might require an increase in rates so large that it causes broad -based economic harm.13  In addition, i f a segment of the financial system comes under stress but does not affect broader credit conditions, easing funding cost s to the entire economy  through monetary policy  may not be appropriate ."
" If financial stress is so large that it causes a macroeconomic downturn, then monetary policy a nd financial stability policy are well aligned, and the objective function can be clearly defined as  12 See, for instance, Ben S."

   restoring economic growth.
" Therefore, monetary policymakers are generally  best served by focusing  squarely  on their macroeconomic objectives."
 Monetary policy cannot  be indifferent  to financial stability risks .
"  At that point , financial stability problem s become a monetary policy concern , as they can adversely affect the flow of credit to households and business es as well as depress economic activity ."
"As I mentioned earlier, i n its deliberations about  monetary policy, the FOMC considers how credit conditions are affecting the economy."
 But  we can expect that the economy remain s vulnerable to unanticipated shocks that affect both financial stability and economic growth .
Concluding Thoughts on Federal Reserve Liquidity Provision  I would like to wrap up  my thoughts today by discussing one of the Federal Reserve’s oldest tools  of both monetary policy and financial stability :  the discount window.
" In conclusion, monetary policy needs to be cognizant  of the risks that financial stress can lead to abrupt changes in the price and quantity of credit, and thus can cause significant harm to the real economy."
" At the same time, focusing  monetary policy decision s on macroeconomic  objective s and using other tools for finan cial stability is likely  the most prudent path."
