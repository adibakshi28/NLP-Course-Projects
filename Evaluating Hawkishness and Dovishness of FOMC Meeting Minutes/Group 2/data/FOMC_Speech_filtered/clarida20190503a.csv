"For release on delivery  11:30 a.m. EDT (8:30  a.m. PDT)  May 3, 2019 Models, Markets, and Monetary Policy Remarks by  Richard H."
"Clarida Vice Chair  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System  at “Strategies for Monetary Policy,”  a Hoover Institution Monetary Policy Conference Stanford University Stanford, California May 3, 2019  It is an honor and a privilege to participate once again in this annual Hoover Institution Monetary Policy C onference."
" The topic of this year’s conference, “Strategies for Monetary Policy ,” is especially timely."
" As you know, the Federal Reserve System is conducting a review of the strategy, tools, and communication practices we deploy to pursue our dual -mandate goals of maximum employment and price stability."
" In this review, we expect  to benefit from the insights and perspectives that are presented today , as well as those offered at other conferences devoted to this topic , as we assess possible practical ways in which we might refine our e xisting monetary policy framework to better achieve our dual -mandate goals on a sustained basis."
"My talk today will not, however, be devoted to a broad review of the Fed’s monetary policy framework—that process is ongoing , and I would not want to prejudge the outcome —but it will instead focus on some of the important ways in which economic models and financial market signals help me think about conducting monetary policy in practice after a career of thinking about it in theory.1 The Role of Monetary Policy  Let me set the scene with a very brief —and certainly selective—review of the evolution over the past several decades of professional thinking about monetary policy."
" I will begin with Milton Friedman’s landmark 1967 A merican E conomic A ssociation presidential a ddress, “The Role of Monetary Policy.”2  This article is , of course , most famous for its message that there is no long -run, exploitable tradeoff between inflation                                                  1 The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of other Federal Reserve Board members or Federal Open Market Committee participants."
" Recent retrospectives on Friedman’s (1968) American Economic Association address  that consider its implications for monetary policy analysis include Hall and Sargent (2018), Laidler (2018), Mankiw and Reis (2018), and Nelson (2018)."
  - 2 - and unemployment .
" And in this paper , Friedman introduced the concept of the “na tural rate of unemployment ,” which today we call u*.3  What is less widely appreciated is that Friedman’s article also contains a concise but insightful discussion of Wicksell’s “natural rate of interest ”—r* in today’s terminology —the real interest rate co nsistent with price stability."
" But while u* and r * provide key reference points in Friedman’s framework  for assessing how far an economy may be from its long -run equilibrium in labor and financial markets, they play absolutely no role in the monetary poli cy rule he advocates :  his wellknown k -percent rule that central banks should aim for and deliver a constant rate of growth of a monetary aggregate."
" Although he acknowledged that shocks would push u away from u* (and, implicitly , r away from r *), Friedman felt the role of monetary policy was to operate with a simple quantity rule that did not itself introduce potential instability into the process by which an economy on its own would converge to u* and r *.4  In Friedman’s policy framework, u* and r * are economic destinations, not policy rule inputs."
" 4 Another  consideration motivating Friedman’s  choice  of rule  was his concern that a more active monetary policy strategy might be difficult to formulate because of the “long and variable lag s” in the effect of monetary policy (a term he had coined in Friedman (1948, p."
" Even during the period from 1979 to 1982, when th e Federal Open Market Committee  was most focused on monetary aggregates, policymakers were still concerned with interest rates in the setting of policy, and  - 3 - proved to be empirically unstable , and there was often only a very loose connection between the g rowth rate of the monetary base—which the central bank could control —and the growth rate of the broader monetary aggregates , which are more tightly linked to economic activity."
" Moreover, the macroeconomic priority  in the 1980s in the U nited States, the U nited K ingdom , and other major countries was to do “whatever it takes” to break the back of inflation and to restore the credibility squandered by central banks that had been  unable or unwilling to provide a nominal anchor after the collapse of the Bretton Woods system."
" By the early 1990s , the back of inflation had been broken (thank you, Paul Volcker) , conditions for price stab ility had been achieved (thank you, Alan Greenspan ), and the time was right for something to fill the vacuum in central bank practice left by the realization that monetary aggregate targeting was not , in practice, a workable monetary policy framework."
" Alt hough it was mostly unspoken, there was a growing sense at the time that a simple, systematic framework for central bank practice was needed to e nsure that the hard -won gains from breaking the back of inflation were not given away by short -sighted, discret ionary monetary experiments that were poorly executed , such as had been the case in the 1970s."
"Policy Rules in Practice .”  Again , for this audience, I will not need to remind you of the enormous impact this single paper had not only on the field of                                                  ultimate objectives for the output gap and inflation figured as criteria for policy decisions."
"  - 4 - monetary economics , but also—and more importantly —on the practice of monetary policy."
" For our purposes today, I will note that the crucial insight of J ohn’s paper was that, whereas a central bank could pick the “ k” in a “k -percent” rule on its own, without any reference to the underlying parameters of the economy (including r * and u*), a well -designed rule for setting a short -term interest rate as a policy instrument should, John argued, respect several requirements .6  First , the rule should anchor the nominal policy rate at a level equal to the sum of its estimate of the neutral real interest rate ( r*) and the inflation target."
" Second, to achieve this nominal anchor , the central bank should be prepared to raise the nominal policy rate by more than one -forone when inflation exceeds target (the Taylor principle)."
" And , third, the central bank should lean against the wind when output —or, via an Okun’s  law relationship, the unemployment rate —deviates  from its estimate of potential ( u*)."
" The third requirement —that monetary policy lean against the wind in response to an output  or unemployment gap —not only contributes to the objective of price stability , but is also obviously desirable from the perspective of a central bank like the Fed that has a dual mandate."
 Another key  study of simple interest rate rules was Henderson and McKibbin (1993).
  It should be noted that a Taylor type rule is an ins trument  rule for achieving the inflation objective that enters the rule.
" In practice,  it is one way to implement a flexible inflation targeting regime."
" See Bernanke and others (1999) and Svensson (1997, 1999) for important contributions  on the considerat ions involved in specifying an inflation -targeting monetary policy strategy."
" In original formulations of Taylor -type rules, r* was treated as constant and set equal to 2 percent, and potential output was set equal to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO ) estimates  of potential output, or, in specifications using the unemployment rate as the activity variable, u* was set equal to the CBO ’s estimate of the  natural unemployment rate."
" At each F ederal O pen M arket C ommittee  (FOMC) meeting, my colleagues and I consult potential policy rate paths implied by a number of policy rules, as we assess what adjustments, if any, may be required for the stance of monetary policy to achieve and  maintain our dual -mandate objectives.8  A presentation and discussion of severa l of these rules has been included in the semiannual Monetary Policy Report to the Congress  since July 2017.9  One thing I have come to appreciate is                                                  7 See, for example, Clarida, Gal í, and Gertler (1999, 2000)."
" 8 For the FOMC’s description of its mandate, s ee the FOMC’s (2019) Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy."
   9 The box “Monetary Policy Rules and Systematic Monetary Policy” in the Board’s February 2019 Monetary Policy Report  (MPR) describes how simple policy rules are used in theory and in practical policymaking.
 The box “Complexities of Monetary Policy Rules” in the July 2018 MPR  discusses how shifts in r*  complicate monetary policy decision  making.
" See Board of  - 6 - that, as I assess the benefits and costs of alternative policy scenarios based on a set of policy rules and economic projections, it is important to recognize up front that key inputs to this assessment, including u* and r* , are unobservable and must be inferred  from data via models.10  I would now like to discuss how I incorporate such considerations into thinking about how to choose among monetary policy alternatives ."
"A monetary policy strategy must find a way to combine incoming data and a model of the economy with a healthy dose of judgment —and humility! —to formulate, and then communicate, a path for the policy rate most consistent with the central bank’s objectives."
 There are two distinct ways in which I think that the path for the federal funds rate should be data dependent.11  Monetary policy should be data dependent in the sense that incoming data reveal at any point in time where the economy is relative to the ultimate objectives of price stability and maximum employment.
" This information on where the economy is relative to the goals of monetary policy is an important input into interest rate feedback  rules —after all, they have to feed back on something."
" As a result, in the real world, monetary policy should be —and in the United States,  I believe, is —data dependent in a second sense:  P olicymakers should and                                                  Governors (2018)."
" As indicated in the Summary of Economic Projections , FOMC participants have, over the  past seven years, repeatedly  revised down their estimates of both u* and r* as unemployment fell and real interest rates remained well below prior estimates of neutral without the rise in inflation those earlier estimates would have predicted  (figures 1 a nd 2) ."
" In addition to u* and r *, another important input in to any monetary policy assessment is the state of inflation expectations."
" Since the late 1990s, inflation expectations appear to have been stable and are often said to be “well anchored .”  However, inflation expectations are not directly observable; they must be inferred from models, other macroeconomic information, market prices, and surveys."
 Longer -term inflation expectations that are anchored materially above or below the 2 percent in flation objective present a risk to price stability.
" For this reason, policymakers should and do study incoming data to extract signals that can be used to update and improve estimates of expected inflation."
" In many theoretical rational expectation s mode ls, expected inflation is anchored at the target level by assumption."
"  - 8 - Financial Markets and Monetary Policy —Extracting Signal from  Noise  Because the true model of the economy is unknown, either because the structure  is unknown or because the parameters of a known structure are evolving , I believe policymakers should consult a number and variety of sources of information about neutral  real interest rates  and expected inflation, to name just two key macroeconomic variables."
" Because macroeconomic models of r * and long -term inflation e xpectations are potentially miss pecified, seeking out other sources of information that are not derived from the same models can be especially useful."
" To be sure, financial market signals are inevitably noisy , and day -today movements in asset prices are unlikely to tell us much about the cyclical or structural position of the economy.12  However, persistent  shifts in financial market conditions can be informative , and signals derived from financial market data—along with surveys of households, firms, and market participants , data, as well as  outside forecasts —can be an important complement to estimates obtained from historically estimated and calibrated macroeconomic models.13                                                   12 Uncertainty regarding r*, u*, and long -term inflation expectations is not the only source of uncertainty that has implications for monetary policy."
" Edge, Laubach, and Williams (2005) show how the duration of a productivity shock can affect even the direction of the best monetary policy response."
" And Eusepi and Preston (2018) show that replacing model -consistent expectations with forms of adaptive learning means that some , but not all, of the key results regarding best conduct in monetary policy under full information carry through."
" 13 Like many others, I believe that monetary policy should respond to financial market fluctuations when they have material implications for ou r outlook for employment and inflation , but monetary policy should not generally target asset prices themselves."
  - 9 - Interest rate futures and interest rate swaps markets provide one source of highfrequency information about the path and destination for the f ederal funds rate expected by market parti cipants  (figure 3).
" Interest rate option markets, under certain assumptions, can offer insights about the entire ex ante probability distribution of policy rate outcomes for calendar dates near or far into the future  (figure 4)."
 But these signals from interest rate derivatives markets are only a pure measure of the expected policy rate path under the assumption of a zero risk premium.
" But when there is a divergence between the path or destination for the policy rate implied by the surveys and a straight  read of interest rate derivatives prices, I place at least as much weight on the survey evidence ( for example, derived from the surveys of primary d ealer s and market participants  conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of New Y ork) as I do on the estimates obtained  from market prices  (figure 3)."
" But, again , the yield curve, like the interest rate futures strip, r eflects not only expectations of the path of short -term interest rates, but also liquidity and term premium  factors    Thus , to extract signal about policy from noise in the yield curve, a term structure model is required."
"monetary policy (Clarida, 2018c )."
" Quotes from the Treasury InflationProtected Securities (TIPS) market can provide valuable information about two key inputs to monetary policy analysis :  long -run r* and expected inflation.14  Direct reads of TIPS spot rates and forward rates are signals of the levels of real interest rates that investors expect at various horizons , and they can be used to complement model -based estim ates of r *."
" In addition, TIPS market data, together with nominal Treasury yields, can be used to construct measures of “break even inflation ” or inflation compensation that provide a noisy signal of market expectations of future inflation."
" But , again, a s traight read of breakeven inflation needs to be augmented with a model to filter out the liquidity and risk premium components that place a wedge between inflation compe nsation and expected inflation."
"As is the case with the yield curve and interest rate futures, it is useful to compare estimates of expected inflation derived from breakeven inflation data with estimates of expected inflation obtained from surveys —for example, the expected inflation  over the                                                  14 Well before the launch of the TIPS market, Friedman (1984) stressed the benefits to mo netary policy analysis that would arise from  the availability of market -based estimates of longer -term inflation expectations, and he contrasted that situation with the one then prevailing, in which it was difficult to ascertain the real yields implied by the market’s longer -term nominal yields."
105) observed—also in the pre -TIPS era —that “it is hard to measure expected long -term inflation rates.”   - 11 - next 5 to 10 years  from the University of Michiga n Survey s of Consumers  (figure 5).
" Market - and survey -based estimates of expected inflation are correlated, but , again , when there is a divergence between the two, I place at least as much weight on the survey evidence as on the market -derived estimates ."
"The examples I have mentioned illustrate the important point that, in practice, there is not typically a clean distinction between “model -based” and “market -based” inference of key economic variables such as r * and expected inflation."
" The reason  is that  market prices reflect not only market expectations , but also risk and liquidity premi ums that need to be filtered out to recover the object of interest —for example, expected inflation or long -run r *."
" This filtering almost always requires a model of some so rt, so even market -based estimates of key inputs to monetary policy are , to some extent, model dependent."
" Implications for Monetary Policy  Let me now draw together some implications of the approach to models, markets, and monetary policy I have laid out in these remarks."
" Macroeconomic models are, of course , an essential tool for monetary policy analysis, but the structure of the economy evolves , and the policy framework must be —and I believe , at the Federal Reserve, is —nimble enough to respect this evoluti on."
" Survey estimates of the long -run destination for key monetary policy inputs can—and, at the Fed ,  - 12 - do—complement the predictions from macro models and market prices  (figure 6).15  Yes, the Fed’s job would be (much) easier if the real world of 2019 satisfied the requirements to run Friedman’s k -percent policy rule, but it does  not and has  not for at least  50 years, and our policy framework must and does reflect this reality."
"  The unemployment rate is at a 50 -year low, real wages are rising in line with productivity, inflationary pressures are muted, and expected inflation is stable."
" Moreover, the f ederal funds rate is now in the range of estimates  of its longer -run neutral level, and the unemployment rate is not far below m any estimate s of u*."
" Plugging these estimates into a 1993 Taylor r ule produces  a federal funds rate very close to our current t arget range for the policy rate.16  So with the economy operating at or very close to the Fed’s dual -mandate objectives and with the policy  rate in the range of FOMC participants’ estimates of neutral, we can , I believe , afford to be data dependent —in both senses of the term as I have discussed —as we assess what, if any, further adjustments in our policy stance might be required to maintain our dual -mandate objectives of maximum employment and price stability."
