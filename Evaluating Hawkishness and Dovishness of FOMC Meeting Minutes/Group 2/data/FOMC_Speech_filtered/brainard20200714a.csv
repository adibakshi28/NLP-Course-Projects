"For release on delivery  2:00 p.m. EDT  July 14, 2020         Navigating Monetary Policy through the Fog of COVID     Remarks by  Lael Brainard   Member   Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at the  Perspectives on the Pandemic Webinar Series, hosted by  the National Association for Business Economics  Washington, D.C.   (via webcast)         July 14, 2020    The COVID -19 contraction is unprecedent ed in modern times for its severity and speed ."
" Following the deepest plunge since the Great Depression, employment and activity rebounded faster and more sharply  than anticipated."
" Lo oking ahead, it likely will be appropriate to shift the focus of monetary policy from stabilization to accommodation by supporting a full recovery in employment and a sustained return of inflation to its 2 percent objective .1     A variety  of data suggest the economy bottomed out in April and rebounded in May and June."
  Payroll employment rebounded strongly in May and June .
" Over May and June, payroll employment increased by 7.5 millio n, the unemployment rate fell 3.6 percentage point s, and the labor force par ticipation rate rose 1.3 percentage point s.4  The large bounceback  is a sharp  contrast to the G lobal F inancial C risis, when the initial employment decline was shallower and it took much longer before a similar share of the initial job losses was recouped ."
"                                                  4 The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) has indicated that  the official unemployment rate has understated the extent of joblessness in recent months because many workers who lost their jobs were incorrectly reported as being employed but absent from work, rather than unemployed on temporary layoff."
" The BLS estimated that this misclassification held down the unemployment rate by about 5 percentage points in April and by about 1 percentage point in June, such that the reduction in the unemployment rate would be about 7½ perc entage points if these job losses were classified correctly."
" They likely were driven by an earlier -thanexpected rollback of COVIDrelated restrictions as businesses ramped  up hiring and consumers exhibited more comfort  engaging in commercial activities, as well as by a boost to employment from the P aycheck Protection Program ."
 These developments mostly occurred after the reference period for the June employment report .
" After declining at a fast clip  through early  June, initial claims for unemployment insurance have moved roughly sideways  in recent weeks  and remained at  a still elevated  level of 1.3 million in the week ending July 4.5  Some highfrequency indicators tracked by Federal Reserve                                                  5 The flattening out seen in recent weeks is even clearer when looking at nonseasonally adjusted claims numbers , which  might be a slightly better measure than seasonally adjusted numbers in the current environment."
"   In addition, the Department of Labor stated that 49 states reported about 1 million initial claims for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) in the week ending July 4."
" However, since most PUA applicants must first apply for, and be denied, regular state unemployment insurance (UI) benefits  before they apply for PUA, initial PUA claims and initial claims for regular UI benefits will be strongly correlated (likely with some lag) and do not constitute independent measures of the number of unemployed persons seeking unemployment benefits."
  - 4 - Board staff ( including mobility data and employment in small businesses) suggest that the strong pace of improvement in May and the first half of June may not be sustained.
" According to the Current Population Survey, the  number of employed persons fell by 14.2 percent from February to June  among African Americans and by 13.4 percent among Hispanics —significantly worse than the  10.4 percent  decline for the population overall .6   Separately, on the other side of our dual mandate, inflation h as receded f urther below its 2 percent objective —reflecting weaker demand along with lower oil prices  in recent months ."
" Both core and total PCE price inflation measures have weakened, with the 12month percent changes through May standing at 1.0 percent and 0.5 percent,  respectively.7  Measures of inflation expectations are mixed ; while marketbased measures have moved below their typical ranges of recent years, survey measures have remained relatively stable within their recent historical ranges .8  Nonetheless, with                                                  6 The Current Population Survey (or household survey) measures the number of employed persons  and includes detailed demographic information, whereas the Current Employment Statistics survey (or establishment survey) measures the number of jobs in the payrolls of nonfarm establishments."
" 7 That said , the trimmed mean PCE inflation rate calculated by the F ederal Reserve Bank of Dallas over the 12 months ending in May remained stable at 2.0 percent ; the data as of May 2020 are available on the Bank’s website at  https://www.dallasfed.org/research/pce ."
 8 The median 5 -to10-year measure from the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers and the median three -yearahead expected inflation from the F ederal Reserve Bank of New York’s Survey of Consumer Expectations both came in at 2.5 percent in June —well within their ranges in recent years.
" Market -based measures of  - 5 - inflation coming in below its 2 percent objective for many years , the risk that inflation expectations  could drift lower complicates the task of monetary policy ."
 Several daily and weekly  retail spe nding indicators tracked by Federal Reserve Board staff suggest that  household spend ing increased quickly in response to stimulus payments and expanded unemployment insurance benefits.
" Household spending stepped up in midApril, coinciding w ith the first disbursement of stimulus pa yments to households and a rampup in the payout of unemployment benefits, and showed the most pronounced increases in the st ates that received more benefits.9  With some of the fiscal support measures either provided as oneoff payments or slated to come to an end in July,                                                  inflation compensation over the next few y ears have retraced much of their sharp declines in midMarch but remain below their typical ranges in recent years."
"  The 5to-10year measure of longer -term inflation compensation  derived from Treasury Inflation -Protected Securities , at around 1.4 percent,  remains notably below pre -pandemic levels."
"Friedman, Nathaniel Hendren, Michael Stepner, and the Opp ortunity Insights Team ( 2020), “ How Did COVID -19 and Stabilization Policies Affect Spending and Employment?"
" Analysis by Bhutta and others  uses data from the Survey of Consumer Finances to assess how the cash  assistan ce (expanded unemployment insurance  benefits and s timulus payments) under the CARES Act would help families cope with job loss  and find that the CARES Act dramatically improves households’ financial security ; see Neil Bhutta, Jacqueline Blair, Lisa J."
"  In contrast, in the absence of the CARES Act, only about half of working families would be able to cover six months of expenses by relying exclusively on their liquid savings and standard unemployment insurance benefits."
"In addition to the headwinds facing demand, there could be persistent effects on the supply side of the economy."
"  - 7 - In downside scenarios, t here could be  some  persistent damage to the pro ductive capacity of the economy from the loss  of valuable  employment  relationships, depressed investment, and the destruction of intangible business capital ."
" Last month, a  majority of Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) participants indicated they expect economic activity to decline notably this year and recover only gradually over the following two years."
 A majority of FOMC participants indicated that they expect core inflation to remain below our 2 percent objective and employment to fall short of its maximum level at least through the end of 2022.
"Looking ahead, it will be important  for monetary policy to pivot  from stabilization to  accommodation by supporting a full recovery in employment and returning inflation to its 2 percent objective  on a sustained basis."
" As we move to the next phase of monetary policy, we will  be guided not only by the exigencies  of the COVID crisis , but also by our evolving understanding of the key longer -run features of the economy, so as to avoid the premature withdrawal of necessary support."
" The likelihood that the policy  rate is at the lower bound more frequently risks eroding expected and actual inflation , which could further compress the room to cut nominal  - 9 - interest rates  in a downward spiral."
" With underlying inflation running below 2 percent for many years and COVID contributing to a further  decline, it is important that monetary policy support inflation  expectations  that are consistent with inflation centered on 2 percent over time."
" And with inflation exhibiting low sensitivity to labor market tightness, policy should not preemptively withdraw support  based on a historically steeper Phillips curve  that is not curre ntly in evidence."
" Instead, policy should seek to achieve employment outcomes with the kind of breadth and depth that were only achieved late in the previous recovery.11  With the policy rate constrained by the effective lower bound, forward guidance consti tutes  a vital way to provide  the necessary accommodation."
" For instance, r esearch suggests that refraining from liftoff until inflation reaches 2 percent could lead to some modest temporary overshooting, which would help offset the previous underperformanc e.12  Balance sheet policies can help extend accommodation by more directly influencing the interest rates that are relevant for household and business borrowing and investment."
