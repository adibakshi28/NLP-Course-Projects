"For release on delivery  3:00 p.m. EDT   May 26, 2021 The Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy Remarks by  Randal K."
"Quarles Vice Chair  for Supervision  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System  at the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy The Brookings Institution Washington, D.C. (via webcast)  May 26, 2021 Thank you, David, and thank you to Brookings and the Hutchins Center for the opportunity to lead things off and be part of this very distinguished panel."
" Today, I will explain why I expect the U.S. economy to continue growing strongly over the remainder of this year and what the implications of that outlook are for monetary policy.1   After the shutdowns and other measures taken in response to the COVID19 outbreak last spring caused the swiftest and deepest recession in U.S. history, the economy has made a powerful recovery."
" Households and businesses adapted, supported by the flexibility and inherent strength of our marketbased economy, by the continued resilience of our banking system, and by significant fiscal and monetary policy support."
" Highly accommodative monetary policy by the Federal Reserve has fostered strong growth in interest rate –sensitive secto rs of the economy such as housing and durable goods, offsetting some of the historic weakness in the service sector last year ."
" With the service sector reopening while other household and business spending remains strong, I expect rapid growth to continue for some time before slowing to a still robust pace next  year."
" Inflation is running significantly above the Federal Reserve’s longerrun goal of 2 percent  primarily as a result of three factors:  t he surge in demand as more services come back on line while goods spending remains robust, the emergence of bottlenecks in some supply chains, and the very low inflation readings recorded last spring dropping out of the calculation  of 12 -month inflation ."
" For reasons I will detail in a moment, I expect that a significant portion of that  recent boost to  inflation  will be transitory, and that it will 1 All of my remarks today represent my own views and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee."
    - 2 - not interfere with the rapid growth driving progress toward the Fed’s maximum -employment goal.
" The progress in reopening has been slower in countries that are among our largest trading partners, weighing on U.S. growth by reducing demand for U.S. exports."
" First, I see increasing recognition by the private and public sectors that  a broad reopening can proceed safely.i  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has dropped most social -distancing recommendations for vaccinated people.2  Although local COVID19 restrictions on schooling and economic activity continue in some areas, most schools are teaching in person at least part  time and more than hal f of states have dropped all capacity constraints on restaurants, bars, and retail establishments."
" Again, a lot of that reflected  the most recent  round of stimulus payments, but as employment grows and people return to normal life and work, the accumulated  stock of savings will support spending for many months to come."
" Strong U.S. demand is boosting imports, but weaker  demand outside the United States, where recovery is slower, is restraining exports, and that problem may not resolve for some time."
" Supply bottlenecks are more -4 - prevalent now, especially in the auto and housing industries, with shortages of inputs leading to slower production that reduces employment growth."
" Although I expect employment to rise significantly in coming months, t he picture is more mixed for the labor market than it is for spending."
" T he unemployment rate remains at 6.1 percent, compared with 3.5 percent preCOVID-19, and there are 8 million fewer jobs."
" Despite recent gains amid reopenings, employment in the travel, leisure, and food services sectors remains well below pre -pandemic levels ."
"  My optimism here reflects the apparent recovery in  overall labor demand —by many metrics, job openings are above 2019 levels, including for workers without a college degree, a group especially affected last year ."
" In the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey data  for March , private -sector job openings as a percentage of total employment increased to  5.6 percent, which is above the previous record for that series  set in November 2018."
"  Job growth of 266,000 in April was a disappointing slowdown from recent months, but good news lurked beneath the headlines:  For those who were working, average hours increased ; the number of people working part time because they couldn ’t find full -time jobs decreased significantly ; and wage growth was very strong."
" And, although the evidence is mixed, we have received plenty of anecdotal reports about the influence of generous unemployment benefits and large cash payments on the willingness of workers to return to work."
"  Now let’s turn to the other ha lf of the Federal Reserve’s economic goals, inflation."
" As I mentioned last week during congressional testimony , I agree with  the widespread view among my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) and most private forecasters that the recent r ise in inflation to well above 2 percent is driven by temporary factors ."
 I expect inflation to begin subsiding at some point over the next several months and to be running close to 2 percent again at some point during 2022.
" Market -implied inflation expectations have risen only to the levels that prevailed in the early 2010s, after which inflation never ran consistently above 2 percent , and most survey measures are sending similar signals."
" Therefore, I consider the se recent i ncreases in inflation expectations a welcome development , reversing the large declines seen last spring and perhaps edging up in response to the message in the FOMC’s new policy framework ."
" That said, my optimistic outlook for growth and employment places me  3 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2021), “Federal Reserve Board Issues Report on the Economic WellBeing of U.S. Households,” press release,  May 17, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/other20210517a.htm ."
" -6 - among those who see the risks to inflation over the medium term as weighted to the upside , relative to my baseline forecast."
" A moment ago, I celebrated the upturn i n wages in April, but it may be a sign that the torrid growth of the economy and labor supply shortages have begun pushing up wages faster than occurred with the moderate economic growth over much of the past decade ."
" It seems like a paradox that there could be labor supply problems and wage pressures at 6 percent unemployment, but it is also a fact."
 It is reasonable to ask if the strength of spending stemming from this unprecedented fiscal stimulus will put significant upward pressure on inflation as households and businesses emerge further from the COVID -7 - event.
" But,  at least to date, the latest round of stimulus seems to be supporting spending and growth without causing an inordinate rise in interest rates or inflation expectations."
"That outcome aligns with the advice of those in  the economics profession who have produced research in recent years that leaves them much more comfortable with high deficits and debt , at least  in countries with low interest rates , than they used to be.4  In 2006, when I was serving as Under Secretary of the Treasury, we were subject to harsh criticism for running a deficit of not quite $250 billion, with total debt held by the public at 35 percent of GDP.5  By contrast, in 2021, the deficit is currently projected to be $3.4 trillion, and total debt held by the public a t the end of fiscal year 2020 was 100 percent of GDP.6    Further fiscal policy actions are, of course , the purview of the Congress and the Administration."
 Surely t he deficit s being run to offset the COVIDrelated shocks have made it even more critical to address the sustainability of government debt in the y ears ahead.

"-8 - consumer price index report and other inflation surprises continue to be supply bottlenecks, and it is reasonable to conclude that these will ease over time."
" If these shortages persist  into 2022, people may adjust their expectations higher for future inflation, which could make abovetarget inflation more persistent than we currently expect."
" We designed our new monetary policy framework for the very different world we live in now, which involves an equilibrium for the economy with slow workforce growth, lower potential growth, lower underlying inflation, and, therefore , lower interest rates."
  One of those differences is that the kind s of “ wage -price spirals ” that characterized inflation dynamics in the 1970s have not been present for a long time.
 It’s quite possible that this situation now prevails because inflation is never high enough for long enough to enter decisionmaking in a material way.
" So, what are the implications for monetary policy?"
 I am fully committed to the FOMC’s new monetary policy framework  and the two  pieces of related guidance that we have put in place for asset purchases and the federal funds rate to implement that framework .
"    The guidance on asset purchases, introduced in December, commits us to increasing our holdings of securities at least at the current pace until substantial further -9 - progress has been made toward the Committee’ s maximum -employment and price -stability goals."
" My personal view is that the rise in inflation —even after discounting temporary factors —and inflation expectations since December  will prove  sufficient to satisfy the standard for inflation in the guidance around asset purchases later this year , but improvement in the labor market  has been slower than I would have liked."
" Fo r instance, t he unemployment rate has decreased only 0.6 percentage points to 6.1 percent, and the labor force participation rate is still nearly the same as it was at the time of the December meeting."
" Therefore, w e need to remain patient in the face of what seem to be transitory shocks to prices  and wages so  long as inflation expectations continue to fluctuate around levels that are consistent with our longerrun inflation goal."
 The best analysis we currently  have is that the rise in inflation to well above our target will be temporary.
" Part of the calculus in balancing the risks of either overshooting or undershooting our 2 percent goal is that the Fed has the tools to address inflation that runs too high, while it is more difficult to raise inflation that falls below target."
"  If we’re w rong, we know how to bring inflation down."
" But if our assessment is correct that inflation is temporary, it would be unwise for us to take actions that might slow the recovery prematurely by trying to stay ahead of inflation, when our best estimate is tha t we are not far behind."
"If my expectations about economic growth, employment, and inflation over the coming months are borne out, however, and especially if they come in stronger than I expect, the n, as noted in the m inutes of the last FOMC meeting , it will become important - 10 - for the  FOMC t o begin d iscussing  our plans  to ad just t he pace of  asset purchases at upcoming meetings ."
" In particular, we may nee d additional public communications about the conditions that constitute substantial f urther p rogress since D ecember towar d our broad and inclusive definition  of maximum  employment ."
" This standard presents inherent  communications challenges becaus e it can not be  summarized by  a single labor market indicator, such as the unemployment rate thresholds used in the Committee’s interest rate forward guidance between late 2012 and late 2013."
"In contrast, the  time for discussing  a change  in the fe deral funds  rate remains  in the future.i  The guidance for the f ederal funds  rate commits t o maintain  the current rate until labor marke t conditions  are consistent with our goal of maximum employment and inflation not only has reached 2 percent, but also is on trac k to moderatel y exceed 2 percent f or some time."
" In the FOMC’ s most recent Summary of  Economic P rojections,  no pa rticipants—eve n those with optimistic growth forecasts such as I’ve outlined today—thought it appropriate tha t liftoff occur be fore 2022."
" Thus, I expect that monetary policy will remain highly accommodative for  some t ime."
" Banks met extraordinary demands for credit last spring from nonfinancial businesses and households while simultaneously providing forbearance on millions of existing loans and building substantial loss reserves , all without significant strains to their overall health."
"  - 12 - and supervision rather than  the blunt tool of monetary policy.8  At a crucial moment in our recovery from the COVID -19 event, the utility of using monetary policy to try to address financial stability concerns would be greatly outweighed by the costs to employment and growth."
