"For release on delivery  7:00 p.m. E ST November 19, 2013          Communication and Monetary Policy     Remarks by   Ben S."
"Bernanke   Chairman   Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at the  National Economists Club Annual Dinner  Herbert Stein Memorial Lecture  Washington, D.C.        November 19, 2013    Nearly eight years ago, when I began my time as Chairman, one of my priorities was to make the Federal Reserve more transparent --and, in particular, to make monetary policy as transparent and open as reasonably possible."
" I believed then, as I do today, that transparency in monetary policy enhances public understanding and confidence, promotes informed discussion of policy options, increases the accountability of monetary policymakers  for reaching their mandated objectives, and ultimately makes policy more effective by tightening the linkage between monetary policy, financial conditions, and the real economy."
" As it has turned out, however, following the stabilization of the financial system, supporting our economy’s recovery from the deepest recession since the Great Depression has required a more prominent role for communicat ion and transparency in monetary policy than ever before."
"  In my remarks, I will discuss how the Federal Reserve’s communications have evolved in recent years and how enhanced transparency is increasing the effectiveness of monetary policy."
" Policy Frameworks and Communication  To understand the critical  role that the Federal Reserve’s communication s about monetary policy has played in recent years, it is useful to start by discussing the role of monetar y policy communication more g enerally, including the relationship between policy communication and the broader policy framework."
"  - 2 - Making monetary policy is sometimes compared to driving a car, with policymakers pressing on the accelerator or the brakes, dep ending on whether the economy needs to be sped up or slowed down at that moment."
" First, the main effects of monetary policy actions on the economy are not felt immediately but instead play out  over quarters or even years."
" Hence, unlike the driver of a car, monetary policymakers can not simply respond to what lies immediately in front of them but must try to look well ahead --admittedly, a difficult task."
" Second, the effec ts of monetary policy on the economy today  depend importantly not only on current policy actions , but also on the public’s expectations of how policy will evolve."
" The public’s expectations about future monetary policy actions matter today because those expectations have important effects on current financial conditions, which in turn affect output, employment, and inflation over time."
" For example, because investors  can choose freely between holding a longer -term security or rolling over a sequence of short -term securities, longer -term interest rates today are closely linked to market participants’ expectations of how short -term rates will evolve."
" If monetary policy makers are expected to keep short -term interest rates low, then current longer -term interest rates are likely to be low as well, all else being equal."
" In short, for monetary policy, expectations matter."
" For example, over the past two decades, many central banks have introduced explicit numerical targets for inflation."
" Supplemented by regular publication of the central bank’s economic forecasts and provisional plans for achieving its objective in the medium term, numerical inflation goals have helped increas e the transparency and predictability of policy in a number of economies."
" Because of its dual mandate from the Congress, which specifies both maximum employment a nd price stability as policy objectives, the Federal Reserve could not adopt a numerical infla tion target as its exclusive goal."
" Nor would it have been appropriate for the FOMC simply to provide a fixed objective for some measure of employment or unemployment, in parallel with an inflation objective ."
" In contrast to inflation, which is determined by monetary policy in the longer run, the maximum level of employment that can be sustained over the longer run is determined primarily by nonmonetary factors, such as demographics, the mix of workforce skills, labor market institutions, and advances in te chnology ."
" Moreover, as these factors evolve, the maximum employment level may change over time."
" Consequently, it is beyond the power of the central bank to set a longer -run target for employment that is immutable or independent of the underlying structur e of the economy.1   The approach on which the FOMC agreed is described in its  statement of longer -run goals and policy strategy , issued in January 2012 and reaffirmed in January of this                                                  1 To be clear, although monetary policy has limited influence on the level of employment that can be sustained in the longer run, it can be used to help eliminate gaps between the current level of employment and its sustainable level --as policy is doing today."
" It then  indicates  that, in the context of the FOMC’s dual mandate,  the Committee sees price stability as corresponding to a 2  percent longer -term inflation goal ."
" On the employment side of the mandate, the Committee  makes its best assessment of the maximum level of employment at any given time, recognizing that such assessments are necessarily uncertain and subject to revision."
" In practice, the Committee often expresses its employment objective in terms of the longe rrun normal rate of unemployment ."
" Currently , FOMC participants’ estimates of  the longer -run normal unemployment rate, as publicly reported in the quarterly Summary of Economic Projections, range from  5.2 to 6 percent.3   As I noted, explicit objectives are most useful when accompanied by provisional plans for achieving them."
" Although the size and diversity of the Federal Reserve’s policymaking committee has made achieving a single consensus forecast difficult, the  quarterly Summary of Economic Projections reports each FOMC participant’s view of the most likely future paths of inflation, unemployment, and output growth, conditional on that individual’s view of appropriate monetary policy."
" In recent years, this survey has also included participants’ projections of the path of future short -term interest rates they see as most likely to achieve the Committee’s goals."
 3 The central tendency of the projections for the longer -run normal unemployment rate (which drops the three highest and three lowest values submitte d by FOMC participants) was  5.2 to 5.8 percent in September.
   - 5 - maximum employment and price stability are complementary.
" When they are not, the FOMC has stated that it will pursue a balanced approach in the pursuit of its dual mandate, working to ensure that  both inflation and employment are close to their desired values in the longer term."
"  The financial crisis and its aftermath, however, have raised even greater challenges for, and demands on, the Federal Reserve’s communication."
" We have had to contend with the persistent effects of the seizing -up of the financial system, the collapse of housing prices and construction, new financial shocks in Europe and elsewhere, restrictive fiscal policies at all levels of government, and, of course, the enormous blows to output and employment associated with the worst U.S. recession since the Great Depression."
" Moreover, for the first time since the FOMC began using the federal funds rate as its policy interest rate, that rate is effectively at zero and thus cannot be lowered meaningfully further."
" In the remainder of my talk, I will discuss how the Federal Reserve has used communication to try to further  inform the public’s expectations about how the FOMC will employ what are currently its two  - 6 - principal policy tools:  its plans regarding its short -term policy interest rate and its large -scale purchases of securities."
" Thus, using the standard means of further easing monetary policy --cutting the target interest rate --was no longer possible ."
 The so -called zero lower bound on the FOMC’s policy interest rate was not the only challenge the Comm ittee faced.
" First, the  depth of  the recession, combined with ongoing concerns about the functioning of the financial system, raised significant uncertainties about both the likely pace of recovery and the effectiveness of monetary policy in supporting gr owth."
" The recoveries from most post -World War II U.S. recessions had been relatively rapid, with production, unemployment, and other key variables returning to close to normal levels within six to eight quarters."
" On the one hand, i f the economy were to recover rapidly and inflation were to increase , monetary policy makers would be able to respond in the normal way, by ra ising the feder al funds rate."
" As the case of Japan illustrates, deflation may impede economic growth while being very difficult to escape."
" To try to preempt such outcomes, a strong case existed for monetary policy to be more accommodative than sugges ted by  standard policy rules  calibrated to normal times.4 So the Committee faced a situation in which more monetary policy accommodation was needed, and possibly for quite a long time --yet its basic policy tool, the federal funds rate target, had been push ed to its limit."
" Fortunately, as I discussed earlier, the degree of accommodation provided by monetary policy depends not just on the current value of the policy rate, but on public expectations of future settings of that rate."
" In particular, following the introduction of dates into the FOMC statement, interest rates  and s urvey measures of policy expectations moved in way s broadly consistent with  the guidance.7  Although the date -based forward guidance appears to have affected the public’s expectations as desired, it did not explain  how future policy would be affected by changes in the economic outlook--an important limitation."
" Indeed, the date in the guidance was pushed out twice in 2012--first to late 2014 and then to mid2015--leaving the public unsure about whether and under what circumstances further changes to the guidance might occur.8  In December of last year, the FOMC addressed this issue by tying its fo rward guidance about its policy rate more directly to its economic objectives.9  Introducing socalled state -contingent guidance, the Committee announced for the first time that no increase in the federal funds rate target should be anticipated so long as  unemployment remain ed above 61/2 percent and inflation and inflation expectations remained stable and near target.10  This formulation provided greater clarity about the                                                  6 See Board of Governors (2011) ."
" Specifically , the guidance says that the Committee  anticipates that its 0 to 1/4 percent target range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6 -1/2 percent, inflat ion between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee's 2 percent longer -run goal, and longer -term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored."
" This threshold formulation helps explain why the Committee was willing to express the guidance be aring on the labor market in terms of the unemployment rate alone, instead of following its usual practice of considering a broad range of labor market indicators."
" In the judgment of the Committee, the unemployment rate-- which, despite some drawbacks in t his regard, is probably the best single summary indicator of the state of the labor market --is sufficient for defining the threshold given by the guidance."
" However, after the unemployment threshold is crossed, many other indicators become relevant to a co mprehensive judgment of the health of the labor market, including such measures as payroll employment, labor force participation, and the rates of hiring and separation."
" In particular, even after unemployment drops below 61/2 percent, and so long as infl ation remains well behaved, the Committee can be patient in seeking assurance that the labor market is sufficiently strong before considering any increase in its target for the federal funds rate."
" For example, bad news about the labor market, which tends to lengthen the amount of time the public expects to be required for the unemployment rate to reach the threshold, should likewise increase the length of time that the public expects policy to remain highly accommodative."
" In response to this shift in policy expectations, interest rates should fall and asset prices should rise,  thus easing financial conditions and helping to offset the adverse change to the outlook."
"  - 10 - Large -Scale Asset Purchases  and Related Communication  Becau se of the severity of the recession and  the disruptions in financial markets, and because short -term interest rates were near the zero lower bound, it became clear early on that more monetary accommodation would be needed than could be provided through the  management of short -term rates alone, even with guidance that those rates would be kept low well into the future."
" Both LSAPs and forward guidance for the federal funds rate support the economy by putting  downward pressure on longer -term interest rates , but they affect longer -term rates through somewhat different channels ."
" To understand the difference, it is us eful to decompose longer -term interest rates into two components :  One reflect s the expected path of short -term interest rates, and the other is called a term premium."
"  As I have noted, f orward rate guidance affects longer -term interest rates primarily by influencing investors’ expectations  of future short -term interest rates."
" Consequently, their yields should fall as investors demand a smaller term premium for holding them."
" This argument depends importantly on the assum ption that the longer -term Treasury and MBS securities that the Fed buys are not perfectly substitutable with other types of assets, an assumption that seems well supported in practice.12 As both forward rate guidance and LSAPs affect longer -term interest r ates, the use of these tools allows monetary policy to be effective even when short -term interest rates are close to zero."
" Moreover, economists do not have as good an understanding as we would like of the factors dete rmining term premiums; indeed, as we saw earlier this year, hard -topredict shifts in term premiums can be a source of  significant volatility in interest rates and financial conditions."
" Of course, elevated unemployment, below -target inflation, lingering  economic fragility, and the harmful effects of long -term unemployment on our society and economic potential also pose significant costs and risks, and the Committee has, thus far, judged that the balance favors the use of LSAPs.  Between November 2008 and June 2012, the FOMC announced or extended a series of asset purchase programs, in each case specifying the expected quantities of assets to be acquired under the program."
" Although these costs must be taken into account, careful analysis suggests that, in fact, LSAPs almost certainly will result in improved government finances:  First, even if a p eriod of no payments to the Treasury occurs, it is highly likely that the payments over the period of unconventional monetary policy will be significantly higher than they would have been without LSAPs; indeed, since 2009, the Fed has remitted more than $3 50 billion to the Treasury, about the same total as it remitted during the 18 years prior to the crisis (1990 -2007 inclusive)."
" Second, a complete accounting of the fiscal effects of LSAPs should take into account the beneficial effects of a stronger econo my on tax receipts, interest payments, and government spending; the reduction in the budget deficit from these sources will certainly outweigh the effects on the deficit of any changes in the pace of Fed payments."
" Finally, while fiscal effects are important, the full effect of the FOMC’s policies also includes important additional benefits of increased economic growth and employment and of greater price stability."
" T he Committee also signaled its expectation that it would  end the purchases and return to an emphasis on rate s policy and f orward  guidance before it had fully attained its dual mandate objectives , stating that “the Committee expects that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase progr am ends and the economic recovery strengthens.”15  The reason for this                                                  14 This criterion was expressed in slightly different ways in the FOMC statements between Sep tember 2012 and January 2013."
"  - 14 - sequencing choice, again, was the greater uncertainty about the costs and efficacy of LSAPs, relative to the more familiar tool of managing the current shortterm interest rate and, through forward guidance, expectations of future short -term interest rates."
" In parti cular, I noted the Committee’s expectation at the time that improvements in the job market would continue, supported by a moderate pickup in growth that would support those gains."
 The Committee additionally expected that inflation would be moving back tow ard its 2  percent objective over time.
"Financial market mov ements are often difficult to account for, even after the fact, but three main reasons seem to explain the r ise in interest rates  over the summer."
" The Committee was looking for evidence that job market gains would continue, supported by a pickup in growth."
"  - 17 - latest reading on the unemployment rate was 8.1 percent, and both we and most private -sector economists were projecting only slow reductions in unemployment in the coming quarters."
 Recent reports on payroll employment had also been somewhat disappointing.
" However, since the program was announced, the unemployment rate has fallen 0.8 percentage point, and a bout 2.6 million payroll jobs have been added."
" As reflected in the latest Summary of Economic Projections and the October FOMC statement, the FOMC still expects that labor market conditions will continue to improve and that inflation will move toward the 2 percent objective over the medium term."
" When, ultimately, asset purchases do slow, it will likely be because the economy has progressed sufficiently for the Committee to rely more heavily on its rate policies, the associated forward guidance, and its substantial continued holdings of securities to maintain progress toward maximum employment and to achieve price stability.18  In particular, the target for the federal funds rate is likely to remain near zero for a considerable time after the asset purchases end, perhaps well after the unemployment                                                  18 By the logic described earlier, the Fed’s maintenance of a large balance sheet ( by reinvesting principal paydowns and r olling over  maturing securities) should continue to put downward pressure on term premiums and longer -term interest rates, even after purchases end."
" Also, as I noted at my June press conference, a strong majority of the Committee now expects that there will be no sales of agency MBS during the process of normalizing monetary policy, although in the longer run limited sales could be used to reduce or eliminate residual MBS holdings."
" Conclusion  I began my time as Chairman with the goal of increasing the transparency of the Federal Reserve, and of monetary policy in particular."
" In response to a financial crisis and a deep recession, the Fed’s monetary policy communications have proved far more important and have evolved in different ways than I would have envisioned eight years ago."
" However, we are still far from where we would like to be, and, consequently, it may be some time before monetary policy returns to more normal settings."
" I agree with the sentiment, exp ressed by my colleague Janet Yellen at her testimony last week, that the surest path to a more normal approach to monetary policy is to do all we can today to promote a more robust recovery.19  The FOMC remains committed to  maintaining highly accommodative policies for as long as they are needed ."
