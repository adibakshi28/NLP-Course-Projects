"For release on delivery  12:20 p.m. EDT  March 29 , 2016         The Outlook, Uncertainty , and Monetary Policy     Remarks by   Janet L."
 It is an honor to appear before you today to speak about the Fed eral Reserve’s pursuit of maximum employment and price stability.
" It also reflected an expectation that the economy would continue to strengthen and that inflation, while low, would move up to the FO MC’s 2 percent objective as the transitory influences of lower oil prices and a stronger dollar gradually dissipate and as the labor market improves further."
" In light of this expectation, the Committee stated in December , and reiterated at the two subsequent meetings, that it “expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate.”1 In my remarks today, I will explain why the Committee anticipates that only gradual increases in the feder al funds rate are likely to be warranted in coming years, emphasizing that this guidance should be understood as a forecast  for the trajectory of policy rates that the Committee anticipates will prove to be appropriate to achieve its objectives, conditiona l on the outlook for real economic activity and inflation."
" Instead, monetary policy will, as always, respond to the economy’s twists and t urns so as to promote, as best as we can in an uncertain economic environment, the employment and inflation goals assigned to us by the Congress."
"  The proviso that policy will evolve as needed  is especially pertinent today in light of global economic and financial developments since December, which at times have included significant changes in oil prices, interest rates, and stock values."
" So far, these developments have not materially altered the Committee’s baseline --or most likely --outlook for economic activity and inflation over the medium term."
" Specifically, we continue to expect further labor market improvement and a return of inflation to our 2 percent objective over the next two or three years, consistent with data over recent months."
" In part, the baseline outlook for real activity and inflation  is little changed because investors responded to those developments by marking down their expectations for the future path of the federal funds rate, thereby putting downward pressure on longer -term interest rates and cushioning the adverse effects on econ omic activity."
"  I will next describe the Committee ’s baseline economic outlook and the risks that cloud that outlook, emphasizing the FOMC’s comm itment to adjust monetary policy as needed to achieve our employment and inflation objectives."
" In addition, the unemployment rate has edged down further, more people are joining the workforce as the prospects for finding jobs  have improved, and the employment -topopulation ratio has increased by almost 1/2 percentage point."
" The housing market continues its gradual recovery, and fiscal policy at all levels of government is now modestly boosting economic activity after exerting a considerable drag in r ecent years."
"  On the other hand, manufacturing and net exports have continued to be hard hit by slow global growth and the significant appreciation of the dollar since 2014."
" These same global developments have also weighed on business investment by limit ing firms’ expected sales , thereby  reducing their demand for capital goods; partly as a result, recent indicators of capital spending and business sentiment have been lackluster."
 Low oil prices have also resulted in large -scale layoffs in the energy sector and adverse spillovers to output and employment in industries that support energy producti on.
"  On balance, overall employment has continued to grow at a solid pace so far this year, in part because domestic household spending has been sufficiently strong to offset  - 4 - the drag coming from abroad."
" In particular,  foreign economic growth now seems likely to be weaker this year than previously expected, and earnings expectations have declined."
" But those effects have been at least partially offset by downward revisions to market expectations for the federal funds rate that in turn have put downward pressure on longer -term interest rates, including mortgage rates, thereby helping to support s pending."
" All told, the Committee continues to expect moderate economic growth over the medium term accompanied by further labor market improvement."
" Consistent with this assessment, the medians of the individual projections for economic growth, unemployment, and inflation made b y all of the FOMC participants for our March meeting are little changed from December.2  A key factor underlying such modest                                                  2 Specifically, the median projections of real GDP growth in 2016 and 2017 revised down 0.2 percentage point and 0.1 percentage point, respectively; the median projections of real GDP growth in 2018 and the longer run were unrevised."
" The median projection for the unemployment rate in late 2016 was unrevised, while the projections for late 2017, late 2018, and the longer run were revised down slightly."
" Finally,  - 5 - revisions is a judgment that monetary policy remains accommodative and will be adjusted at an appropriately gradual pace to achieve  and maintain our dual objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation."
" As has been widely discussed, the level  of inflation -adjusted or  real interest rates needed to keep the economy near full employment appears to have fallen to a low level in recent years."
" Although estimates vary both quantitatively and conceptually, the evidence on balance indicates that the economy’s “neutral” real r ate--that is, the level of the real federal funds rate that would be neither expansionary nor contractionary if the economy was operating near its potential--is likely now close to zero.3  However, the current real federal funds rate is even lower, at roughly minus 11/4 percentage point, when measured using the 12month change in the core price index for personal consumption expenditures                                                  although the median projection for overall inflation in 2016 was revised down 0.4 percentage poin t, median projections for subsequent years were unrevised; in addition, median projections for core inflation were almost unrevised for all years."
" I showed that model -based estimates of the “natural rate,” when the natural rate is defined as the real short -term interest rate that would prevail in the absence of frictions that slow the adjustm ent of wages and prices to changes in the economy, are currently close to zero in four macroeconomic models used by Federal Reserve staff."
" Thus, the c urrent stance of monetary policy appears to be consistent with actual economic growth modestly outpacing potential growth and further improvements in the labor market.4 Looking beyond the near term, I anticipate that growth will also be supported by a lessening of some of the headwinds that continue to restrain the U.S. economy, which include weak foreign activity, dollar appreciation, a pace of household formation that has not kept up with population and income growth and so has depressed homebuilding, and productivity growth that has been running at a slow pace by historical standards since the end of the recession."
" Otherwise, monetary policy would eventually become overly accommodative as the economy strengthened.5 Implicitly, this expectation of fading headwin ds and a rising neutral rate is a key reason for the FOMC’s assessment that gradual increases in the federal funds rate over time will likely be appropriate."
 The future path of the federal funds rate is necessarily uncertain because economic activity and inflation will likely evolve in unexpected ways.
" More generally, the economy                                                  4 Assuming that the current gap between the actual federal funds rate and its neutral value is about 125 basis points, simulations of the FRB/US model under vector -autoregression -based expectatio ns suggest that maintaining this interest rate gap for the next couple of years would lower the unemployment rate 1/2 percentage point or so below what it otherwise would be if the gap were instead immediately closed."
"5 Of course, any gap between the real federal funds rate and the neutral rate will eventually need to be closed in order to stabilize inflation at 2 pe rcent, keep employment at its maximum level, and the economy growing in line with its potential rate."
"  Turning to inflation, here too the baseline outlook is little changed."
" In December, the FOMC anticipate d that inflation would remain low in the near term due to the drag from lower prices for energy and imports ."
" But as those transitory effects faded, the Committee expected inflation to  move up to 2 percent over the medium term, provided the labor market improves further and inflation expectations are stable."
" In contrast, core PCE inflation , which strips out volatile food and energy components , was up 1.7 percent in February on a 12 month basis, somewhat more than my expectation in December ."
" Even when measured on a 12 -month basis , core inflation can vary substantially from quarter to quarter  and earlier dollar appreciation is still expected to weigh on consumer prices in the coming months ."
" This projection, however, depends critically on expectations for future inflation remaining reasonably well anchored."
" It is still my judgment that inflation expectations are well anchored, but as I will shortly discuss, continued low readings for some indicators of expected inflation do concern me."
"  One concern pertains to the pace of global growth, which is importantly influenced by developments in China."
 There is a consensus that China’s economy will slow in the coming years as it transitions away from investment toward consumption and from exports toward domestic sources of growth.
 These uncertainties were heightened by market confusion earlier this year over China’s exchange rate policy.
" For the United States, low oil prices, on net, likely will boost spending and economic activity over the next few years because we are still a major oil importer."
"If such downside risks to the outlook were to materialize, they would likely slow U.S. economic activity , at least to some extent, both directly and through financial market  - 9 - channels as investors respond by demanding higher returns to hold risky ass ets, causing financial conditions to tighten."
" Risks to the I nflation O utlook  The inflation outlook has also become somewhat more uncertain since the turn of the year, in part for reasons related to risks to the outlook for economic growth."
" To the extent that recent financial market turbulence signals an increased chance of a further slowing of growth abroad, oil prices could resume falling , and the dollar could start rising again."
" And if foreign developments were to a dversely affect the U.S. economy by more than I expect, then the pace of labor market improvement would probably be slower, which would also tend to restrain growth in both wages and prices."
" But even if such developments were to occur, they would, in my view, only delay the return of inflation to 2 percent, provided that inflation expectations remain anchored."
" Unfortunately, the stability of long errun inflation expectations cannot be taken for granted."
" During the 1970s, inflation expectations rose markedly because the Federal Reserve allowed actual inflation to ratchet up persistently in response to economic disruptions --a development that made it more difficult to stabilize both inflation and employment."
" With considerable effort, however, the FOMC gradually succeeded in  - 10 - bringing inflation back down to a low and stable level over the course of the 1980s and early 1990s."
" Since this time, measures of longer -run inflation expectations derived from both surveys and financial markets have been remarkably stab le, making it easier to keep actual inflation relatively close to 2 percent despite large movements in oil prices and pronounced swings in the unemployment rate."
" Lately, however, there have been signs that inflation expectations may have drifted down."
" Ma rketbased measures of long errun inflation compensation have fallen markedly over the past year and half, although they have recently moved up modestly from their alltime lows."
" Similarly, the measure of long errun inflation expectations reported in the University of Michigan Survey of  Consumers has drifted down somewhat over the past few years and now stands at the lower end of the narrow range in which it has fluctuated since the late 1990s."
"  The shifts in these measures notwithstanding, the argument t hat inflation expectations have actually fallen is far from conclusive."
" Analysis carried out at the Fed and elsewhere suggests that the decline in market -based measures of inflation compensation has largely been driven by movements in inflation risk premi ums and liquidity concerns rather than by shifts in inflation expectations.6  In addition, the long errun measure of inflation expectations from the Michigan S urvey has historically exhibited some sensitivity to fluctuations in current gasoline prices, whi ch suggests that this measure may be an unreliable guide to movements in trend inflation under current circumstances.7  Moreover, measures of long errun expected inflation gleaned from                                                  6 For related background discussions, see Bauer and Rudebusch (2015), Abrahams and others (2012 [rev."
" 7 Similarly , a monthly survey conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York shows a noticeable decline over the past two years in household expectations for inflation three years ahead."
" If so, the return to 2 percent inflation could take longer than expected and might require a more accommodative stance of monetary policy than would otherwise be appropriate.8   Despite the declines in some indicators of expected inflation, we also need to consider the opposite risk that we are underestimating the speed at which inflation will return to our 2 percent objective."
" Economic growth her e and abroad could turn out to be stronger than expected, and, as the past few weeks have demonstrated, oil prices can rise as well as fall."
" More generally, economists’ understanding of inflation is far from perfect, and it would not be all that surprising if inflation was to rise more quickly than expected over the next several years."
 Monetary Policy I mplications  Let me now turn to the implications for monetary policy of this assessment of the baseline outlook and associated risks .
" 8 Another risk to the inflation forecast, although one that has not changed appreciably sinc e the turn of the year, is that the Committee may have overestimated the longer -run rate of unemployment consistent with inflation stabilizing at 2 percent."
" If so, a lower level of unemployment might be needed to fully eliminate slack in the labor market, drive faster wage growth, and return inflation to our 2 percent objective."
" In particular, d evelopments abroad imply that meeting our objectives for employment and inflation will likely require a somewhat lower path for the federal funds rate than was anticipated in December."
" This caution is especially warranted  because, with the federal funds rate so low, the FOMC’s ability to use conventional monetary policy to respond to econom ic disturbances  is asymmetric."
" By contrast, if the expansion was  to falter  or if inflation was  to remain stubbornly low , the FOMC would be able to provide only a modest degree of additional stimulus by cutting the federal funds rate back to near zero .9 One must be careful , however, not to overstate the asymmetries affecting monetary policy at the moment."
" In particular , we could use the approaches that we and other central banks successfully employed in the wake of the financial crisis to put additional downward pressure on longterm interest rates and so support the economy --specifically, forward guidance about the                                                  9 Research suggests that , all else being equal,  increased uncertainty and greater downside risk in the vicinity of the effect ive lower bound on nominal interest rates call for  greater gradualism under optimal policy  than would be the case if short -term nominal interest rates were appreciably above zero ."
" If so, as I emphasized earlier, the FOMC will adjust monetary policy as warranted."
" As I have already noted, the decline in market expectations since December for the future path of the federal funds rate and accompanying downward pressure on long -term interest rates have helped to offset the contractionary effects of somewhat less favorable financial conditions and slower foreign growth."
 Studies suggest that either action would reduce the term premiums embedded in longer -term interest rates considerably.
" I continue to strongly believe that monetary policy is most effective when the FOMC is forthcoming in addressing economic and financial developments such as those I have discussed in these remarks, and when we speak clearly about how such developments may affect the outlook and the expected path of policy ."
