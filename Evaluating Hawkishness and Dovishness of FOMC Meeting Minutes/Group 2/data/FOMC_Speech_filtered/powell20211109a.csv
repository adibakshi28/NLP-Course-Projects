" In the later years of the long expansion that ended with the  - 2 - pandemic, the benefits of employment continued to spread more widely and to reach those at the margins of the economy."
" Prior to the pandemic, unemployment was at 50year lows."
 Racial disparities in unemployment were narrowing.
" In contrast, one of the great cruelties of the C OVID19 recession is the toll it took on workers who were finally beginning to experience the benefits of a period of historically long economic growth."
" The specific goals given to us by Congress, however, to foster achievement of our dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability, form the foundation of a strong and stable economy."
" It was with this in mind that my colleagues and I on the Federal Open Market Committee, as part of last year’s update to the Fed’s monetary policy framework, defined maximum employment as a broad and inclusive goal."
" While monetary policy does not target any particular group of people, when we assess whether we are at maximum employment, we purposely look at a wide range of indicators, and we are attentive to disparities in the labor market, rather than just the headline numbers."
" And as we worked to update our monetary policy framework, we host ed a series of listening events across the country before and during the pandemic, and these conversations factored importantly into our thinking and our new framework."
