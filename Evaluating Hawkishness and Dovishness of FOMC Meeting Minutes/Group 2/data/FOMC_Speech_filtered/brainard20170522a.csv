"For release on delivery  7:30 p.m. EDT (6: 30 p.m. CDT)  May 22, 2017          Why Opportunity and Inclusion Matter to America’s Economic Strength     Remarks by   Lael Brainard   Member   Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at the   Opportunity and  Inclusive Growth Institute Conference , sponsored by  the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis   Minneapolis, M innesota         May 22, 2017 I want to thank Neel Kashka ri for launching the Opportunity and  Inclusive Growth Institute  and for inviting me to join the deliberations of this distinguished group today."
"  I will touch on the key ways that opportunity and inclusion matter for policymaking at the Federal Reserve, ranging from our dual -mandate goal of maximum employment to our monitoring  of household financial health to our engagement in low - and moderate -income communities all over the country ."
  - 2 - helps  stakeholders in these communities partner  to improve opportunity and inclusi ve growth .
 Inclusion and Maximum  Employment  Inclusion is an e nduring goal of public policy that is e mbodied in our maximum -employment mandate .
" The Employment Act of 1946 charges the federal government with creating “ conditions under which there will be afforded useful employment  for those able, willing, and seeking to work, and to promote maximum employment, production, and purchasing power.”2  Maximum employment is inherently an inclusive goal."
"  In 1977, the Congress amended the Federal Reserve Act to make achieving maximum employment an explicit objective of monetary policy, along with stable prices."
"  In fulfilling its dual mandate, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has set a target of 2 percent for inflation but does not have a similarly fixed numerical goal for maximum employment."
" That is because  the level of maximum employment depends on “nonmonetary factors that affect the structure and dynamics of the labor market ,” which can change in important ways over time.3   The recogni tion that maximum employment evolve s over time to reflect  changes in the economic landscape serves us well."
" This approach to maximum employment has allowed                                                  2 See the Employment Act of 1946, Pub."
 3 The FOMC’s inflation target was adopted  in January 2012 in the Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy.
 It was amended in January 2017 to clarify that the target is symmetric around 2 percent; the most recent Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy (in which the quoted text appears in paragraph 3) is available on the Board’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomc_longerrungoals.pdf .
"   - 3 - the FOMC to navigate the current recovery in a way  that has likely brought more people back into productive employment than might have been the case with a fixed, aggregate unemployment -rate target based on pre -crisis norms , in effect , achieving  more inclusive growth ."
 This is especially true at a time wh en the traditional Phillips  curve relationship between unemployment and inflation is  extremely flat  for reasons we do not fully understand.
" When we disaggregate the economy -wide labor market statistics, we often find significant and persistent racial disparities.4  For many decades, the unemployment rate of African Americans has been nearly double the national unemployment rate, with little indication that  the relative difference is  narrowing  or that it can be fully accounted for by education or sector al mix ; the unemployment rate for Hispanics also has consistently been higher than the national unemployment rate .5  Similarly, d uring the Great Recession, the unemployment rates of African Americans and Hispanics rose more sharply and rapidly tha n for workers as a whole.6  Even though the unemployment  rates of thes e groups are back around their pre -recession levels, they remain higher than the national average."
" We can also see persisten t disparities by gender , such as the well -known wage premium earned by  men relative  to women with similar experience and expertise.7  With its focus on inclusive growth, this Institute could give us important insights on how far the overall economy is from full employment, as well as the barriers                                                  4 Board of Governors  (2016) discusses some recent trends."
" 5 Cajner and others (2017) find that the higher, more cyclical unemployment of African Americans than whites cannot be fully accounted for by differences in education, age, marital status, an d state of residence."
" - 4 - that could be limiting the e conomy’s potential , by studying labor market outcomes of men and women of different racial and ethnic backgrounds in more depth.8    Research on the drivers of disparities in labor market outcomes can also help the Federal Reserve better assess potential t radeoffs in monetary policy."
" In meetings  with community groups , we often hear from advocates who  point to the stark discrepancy they see between the economy’s aggregate U -3 unemployment rate, which many forecasters estimate to be  at or approaching full employment, and the much higher rates of unemployment among the people in their neighborhoods."
" For instance, Rod Adams, a neighborhood advocate here in Minneapolis, noted the unemployment rate for African Americans locally was still almost 9 percent late last summer and observed that “if the labor market were truly healthy, people in my community would all be able to find full -time jobs at decent wages.”9  While the policy tools available to the  Federal Reserve are not well  suited to addressing the  barriers that contribut e to persistent disparities in the labor market outcomes of different groups, understanding these barriers and efforts to address them is vital in assessing maximum employment as well as potential growth."
" - 5 - Atlanta found themselves overwhelmed by t he sharp rise in unemployment, which highlighted the need for a better connected and stronger network of job training and placement services."
"  Just as the re is a connection between maximum employment and inclusive growth, so , too, the re is an important  connection between potential output and opportunity."
" If there are large disparities in opportunity based on geography or race or gender, such that households’ enterprise, exertion, and investments are not rewarded commensura tely, then families and small businesses will invest less in the future  and potential growth will fall short.11  Indeed, one worr isome  trend is the decline in the labor force participation of prime -age workers with less education , a trend that has been going on for decades among men and that has more recently begun to be mirrored in the participation rate of women .12  Understanding this growing detachment from work is important to improving  both opportunity and potential growth."
" According to the Survey of Consumer Finances, on average from 1989 to 2013, about 80 percent of households in the bottom quintile of the income distribution had less than $3,000 adjusted for inflation in liquid assets  (cash, checking, or savings accounts) ."
"Wh ile low -income households were particularly vulnerable to the consequences of the collapse in house prices, rise in unemployment, and tightening of credit in the Great Recession, the preceding rise in mortgage debt was widespread, also including higher -income households, as documented by Bhutta (2015) and Adelino, Schoar, and Severino  (2016)."
"  Slower income growth, as well as substantial volatility in income, ha s raised the financial stress faced by low - and moderate -income fami lies and may be limiting absolute mobility across generations."
" Over time, the “American Dream” that each generation can expect to be better off than their parents’ generation has gone from being widespread  to increasingly out of reach for much of  the population.20  Researchers have found that the reduction in economic mobility has been driven primarily by a more  unequal distribution of economic growth, with slower overall gross domestic product ( GDP ) growth a secondary factor.21   Many households ha d been co ntending with volatile  income s even before the large negative shocks of the Great Recession and the increase in contingent work                                                  19 See, for example, Parker (2014) and Sufi (2014) for useful, research -founded ideas for assessing and monitoring the potential for financial fragility among household s in the context of the financial system ; see also Palumbo (forthcoming) for a particular application ."
" 21 Chetty and others (2017)  estimate that the slower overall GDP growth experienced by the 1980 birth cohort relative to the 1940 birth cohort can account for about 10 percenta ge points of the decline in absolute mobility, while the less equal distribution of income can account for about 30 percentage points of the decline."
" Commenting on this work, Katz and Krueger (2017)  underscore that stagnant growth of median household inco me since the 1970s has been central to the decline in absolute mobility."
" The lesson th at even a moderate decline in house prices can erase home equity  applies bro adly, along with  the importance of sound underwriting and servicing, but  the painful consequences in the recession were  greater among minority and low -income homeowners .26  The fact , discussed earlier,  that                                                  22 See Brainard (2016) on the gig economy and the growth of contingent work."
" To advance  more inclusive growth  and opportunity , it is essential to help people , especially first -time and nontraditional college students, access smarter educational investments with more reliable and bette r return s.34  Communities of Opportunity  The connection between the conditions in a community and individual opportunity has been demonstrated in powerful research that many of you have pioneered , and we see this connection every day in our work in communit ies around the country ."
" More recently, Hellerstein , Neumark, and McInerney ( 2008) find evidence for a “spatial -racial mismatch”--namely, that employment among low -skilled black men depends on proximity to employers who hire black workers."
" Technological change, globalization , and other shifts in demand and costs are not new to the U.S. economy, but there are troubling signs that less diversified or more isolated locali ties have diminished  ability to recover ."
" And there is increasing evidence that such concentrated economic shocks can also lead  to severe labor market stress, as well as broader consequences for health and mortality.46  Over the past 30 years, the convergence in income across regions of the country has slowed dramatically.47   Even so, some localities fare better than others in establishing new paths to opportunity and inclusive growth, and their successes provide actionable lessons."
" A t the Federal Reserve, we  will continue to  navigate the recovery to ensure we reach and sustain our long -term goals of maximum employment and price stability."
