"For release on delivery  9:30 a.m. E DT April 11, 2019         U.S. Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy     Remarks by   Richard H."
" Before we  begin our conversation, I want to share a few though ts about the outlook for the economy and monetary policy.1 Current Economic Situation and Outlook  The U.S. economy is in a good place  and operating  close to both of th e Federal Reserve’s  dual -mandate objectives of maximum employment and price stability ."
" The unemployment rate is near the lowest level recorded in 50 yea rs, and average monthly job gains have continued to outpace the increases needed over the longer run to provide jobs for new entrants to the labor force."
economic  growth is slowing somewhat from 2018’ s robust pace.
" Prospects for foreign economic growth have been marked down, and important in ternati onal risks, such as Brexit, remain."
"inflation as measured by the core p ersonal c onsumption e xpenditures (PCE)  price index , which excludes volatile food and energy prices and is a better gauge of underlying inflation pressures, has been muted ."
 And some indicators of longer -term inflation expectations remain at the low end of a range that I consider consistent with our price -stability mandate.
  - 2 - The considerations I just mentioned have led most private -sector forecasters to project that growth will continue in 2019 but at a s omewhat slower pace than in 2018.
" At the Federal Reserve, i n our  most recent Summary of Economic P rojections, the median participant on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) project ed that in 2019, GDP growth of 2 percent wi ll be the modal , or most likely , outcome ; that core PCE inflation will rise  to 2 percent ; and that the unemployment rate will fall a bit further , to 3.7 percent , by the end of the year ."
"Monetary Policy  Given this outlook for the U.S. economy, we decided at our March  meeting that the current stance of  monetary policy is appropria te.2  The federal funds rate is now in the broad range of estimates of neutral --the rate that tends neither to stimulate nor to restrain the economy."
 Our baseline economic projections see economic growth for the year as a whole running somewhat above the Committee’ s median estimate of its longer -run trend and c ore PCE i nflation remain ing near our 2 p ercent objective .
" For these reasons, we have indicated we can  be patient as we assess what adjustments , if any, will be appropriate to the stance of monetary policy."
 - 3 - runoff of our securities  starting in May and to cease the runoff entirely in September .3  This decision is the culmination of discussions that we  had over the previous four meeting s about our operating framework and reflects our desire to converge to a balance sheet that is no larger than it needs to  be to conduct monetary policy efficiently and effectively.
"  As you may know, last  November t he Federal Reserve announced that in 2019 we are undertaking a System review of our  monetary policy strategy, tools, and communications practices."
" Information about this review can be found on the Federal Reserve Board’s website.4  In this review, we will listen to a broad range of stakeholders at public events held around the country, and we will draw on the ir insights as we assess how best to achieve and maintain maximum employment and price stability in the most robust fashion possible."
