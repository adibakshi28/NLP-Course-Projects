"For release on delivery  11 a.m. EDT  July 2, 2014          Monetary Policy and Financial Stability     Remarks by   Janet L."
" In these roles, he was well aware of the challenges central banks face in their pursuit of price stability and full employment, and of the interconnections between macroeconomic stability and financial stability."
" These episodes took place in emerging market economies,  but since then, the global financial crisis and , more recently , the euro crisis have reminded us that no economy is immune from  financial instability and the adverse effects  on employment, economic activity, and price stability that financial crises cause."
" There have also been calls, from some quarters, for a fundamental reconsideration of the goals and strategy  of monetary policy."
 Today I will focus on a key  question spurred by this debate:   How should monetary and other policymakers balance macroprudential approaches and monetary policy in the pursuit of financial stability ?
"In my remarks, I will arg ue that monetary policy faces significant limitations as a tool to promote financial stability:  Its effects on financial vulnerabilities, such as excessive leverage and maturity transformation, are not well understood and are less  - 2 - direct than a regulatory  or supervisory approach; in addition, efforts to promote financial stability through adjustments in interest rates would increase the volatility of inflation and employment."
" I am also mindful of the potential for low interest rates to  heighten the incentives  of financial market participants to reach for yield and take on risk, and of the limits of  macroprudential measures  to address these and other financial stability concerns ."
" Accordingly, there may be times when an adjustment in monetary policy may be appropriate to ameliorate emerging risks to financial stability."
" Because of this possibility, and because transparency enhances the effectiveness of monetary policy, it is crucial that policymakers communicate their views clearly on the risks to financial stability and how such risks influence the appropriate monetary policy  stance."
 I will conclude by briefly laying out h ow financial stability concerns affect my current assessment of the appropriate stance of monetary policy.
" Balancing F inancial Stability with Price Stability:   Lessons from the Recent Past  When considering the connections  between financial stability, price  stability, and full employment, the discussion often focus es on the potential for conflict s among these   - 3 - objectives."
" But it is important to note that, in many ways, the pursuit of financial stability is complementary to the goals of price stability and full employment."
" A  smoothly operating financial system promotes the efficient allocation of saving and investment, facilitating economic growth and employment."
" Despite these complementarities,  monetary policy has powerful effects on  risk taking ."
" But such risktaking can go too far, thereby contributing to fragility in the financial system.1  This possibility does not obviate the need for monetary policy to focus primarily on price stability and full employment-- the costs to society in terms of  deviations from price stability and full employment that would a rise would likely be significant ."
                                                   - 4 - vulnerabilities might have been affected had the Federal Reserve tightened monetary policy in the mid -2000s to promote financial stability.
 A tighter monetary policy would not have closed the gaps in the regulatory structur e that allowed some SIFIs and markets to escape comprehensive supervision;  a tighter monetary polic y would not have shifted supervisory attention to a macroprudential perspective ; and a tighter monetary policy would not have increased the transparency of e xotic financial instruments or ameliorated deficiencies in risk measurement and risk management within the private sector.
" Some advocates of the view that a substantially tighter monetary policy may have helped prevent the crisis might acknowledge these points,  but they might also argue that a tighter monetary policy could have limited the rise in house prices , the use of leverage within the private sector, and the excessive reliance on short -term funding, and that each of these channels would have conta ined--or perhaps even prevented --the worst effects  of the crisis."
" A review of the empirical evidence suggests that the level of interest rates does influence house prices, leverage , and maturity transformation , but it is also  clear that a tighter monetary policy would have been a very blunt tool :  Substantially mitigating  the emerging financial vulnerabilities  through higher interest rates would have had sizable adverse effects in terms of higher unemploym ent."
" In particular, a range of studies conclude  that tighter monetary policy during the mid -2000s m ight have contributed to a slower rate of house price appreciation."
" But the magnitude of this effect would likely have been  modest relative to the substantial momentum in these  prices over the period;  hence, a very significant  tightening, with large increases in un employment, would have   - 6 - been necessary to halt  the housing bubble.2  Such a slowing in the housing market m ight have constrained the rise in household leverage, as mort gage debt growth would have been slower ."
" But the job losses  and higher interest payments associated with higher interest rates would have directly weakened households’  ability to repay previous debts, suggesting that a sizable tightening may have mitigated vulnerabilities  in household balance sheets only modestly .3 Similar mixed results would have been likely with regard to the effects of tighter monetary policy on leverage and reliance on short -term financing within the financial sector."
" In parti cular, the evidence that low interest rates contribute to increased leverage and reliance on short -term funding  points toward some ability of higher interest rates to lessen these vulnerabilities, but that evidence is typically consistent with  a sizable range 2 For a discussion of this issue encompassing experience across a broad range of advanced economies in the 2000s, including the United States, see Jane Dokko , Brian M."

" Igan and Loungani (2012) highlight how interest rates are an important, but far from the most important, determinant of housing cycles across countries  (see Deniz Igan and Prakash Loungani (2012), “Global Housing Cycles,” IMF Working Paper Series WP/12/217 (Washington:  International Monetary Fund, August), www.imf.org/external/pubs/cat/longres.aspx?sk=26229.0)."
" Bean and others (2010) , examining the tradeoffs between unemployment, inflation, and stabilization of the housing market in the United Kingdom , imply  that reliance on monetary policy to contain a housing boom may be too costly in terms of other monetary policy goals  (see Charles Bean, Matthias Paustian, Adrian Penalver, and Tim Taylor (2010), “Monetary Policy after the Fall,” paper presented at “Macroeconomic Challenges:  The Decade Ahead,” a symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, held in Jackson Hole, Wyo., August  2628, www.kansascityfed.org/publicat/sympos/2010/201008-23bean.pdf)."
"  Saiz (2014) suggests that about 50 percent of the variation in house prices during the 2000s boom can be explained by low interest rates, and finds that it was the remaining, “non -fundamenta l” component that subsequently collapsed --that is, the interest rate component was not a primary factor in what Saiz terms “the bust ” (see Albert Saiz (2014), “Interest Rates and Fundamental Fluctuations in Home Values,” paper presented at the Public Polic y and Economics Spring 2014 Workshops, hosted by the Harris School of Public Policy, University of Chicago, April 8, http://harrisschool.uchicago.edu/sites/default/files/SAIZ%20FUNDAMENTALS1_0.pdf )."
"3 The notion that tighter monetary policy may have ambiguous effects on leverage or repayment capacity is illustrated in, for example, Anton Korinek and Alp Simsek (2014 ), “Liquid ity Trap and Excessive Leverage,” NBER Working Paper Series 19970 (Cambridge, Mass.:  National Bureau of Economic Research, March) ."

" In my assessment, macroprudential policies , such as regulatory limits on leverage and short -term funding , as well as stronger underwritin g standards , represent far more direct and likely more effective methods  to address these vulnerabilities.5 Recent International Experience  Turning to recent experience outside the United States , a number of foreign economies have seen  rapidly rising real estate prices , which has rais ed financial stability concerns despite, in some cases,  high unemployment and shortfalls in inflation relative to the central bank ’s inflation target.6  These developments have prompted debate  on how to 4 See, for example, Tobias  Adrian  and Hyun Song Shin (2010 ), “Liquidity and Leverage ,” Journal of Financial Intermediation, vol."
" For a study emphasizing how changes in the response of monetary policy to f inancial vulnerabilities would  likely change the relationship between monetary policy and financial vulnerabilities, see Oliver de Groot (2014 ), “The Risk Channel of Monetary Policy,”  International Journal of Central Banking,  vol."
5 This evidence and experience suggest that a reliance on monetary policy as a primary tool to address the broad range of vulnerabilities that emerged in the mid -2000s would have had uncertain and limited effects on risks  to financial stability.
 Such uncertainty  does not imply that a modestly tighter monetary policy may not have been marginally helpful.
" For example , some research suggests that financial imbalances that became apparent in the mid -2000s may have signaled a  tighter labor market and more inflationary pressure than would have been perceived solely from labor market conditions and overall economic activity."
" Hence, such financial imbalances may have called for a modestly tighter monetary policy through the trad itional policy lens focused on inflationary pressure and economic slack."
                                                   - 8 - best balance the use of monetary policy and macroprudential  tools  in promoting financial stability .
"For example, Canada, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom have expressed a willingness to use monetary policy to address financial stability  concerns in unusual circumstances, but they have similarly concluded that macroprudential policies should serve as the primary tool to pursue financial stability ."
" In Canada, w ith inflation below target and output growth quite subdued, the Bank of Canada has kept the policy rate at or below 1 percent, but  limits on mortgage lending were tightened in each of the years from 2009 through 2012, including changes in loanto-value and  debt -toincome caps, among other measures .7  In contrast, in Norway and Sweden, monetary policy decisions have been in fluenced somewhat by financial stability concerns , but the steps taken have been limited ."
" In Norway, policymakers increased the  policy interest rate in mid -2010 when they were facing escalating household debt despite  inflation below target and output below capacity, in part as a way of “guarding against the risk of future imbalances.”8  Similarly, Sweden’s Riksbank held its policy rate “slightly higher than we would have done otherwise” because of  financial stability concerns .9  In both cases, macroprudential actions were also either taken or under consideration."

"                                                    - 9 - In reviewing  these experiences, it seems clear that monetary policymakers have perceived significant hurdles to using sizable adjustments in monetary policy  to contain financial stability risks ."
 Some proponents of a larger  monetary policy response to financial stability concerns might argue that these perceived hurdles have been overblown and that financial stability concerns  should be elevated significantly in monetary policy discussions .
" A more balanced assessment , in my view, would be that increased focus on financial stability risks is appropriate in monetary policy discussions , but the  potential  cost, in terms of diminished macroeconomic performance, is likely to  be too great  to gi ve financial stability risks a central role  in monetary policy decisions, at least most of the time."
" If monetary policy is not to play a central  role in addressing financial stability issues, this task must rely on  macroprudential policies."
"                                                   - 10 - what the limits of such tools  may be , and when , because of such limits,  it may be  appropriate  to adjust monetary policy to “ get in the  cracks” that persist i n the macroprudential framework.11 In weighing these questions , I find it helpful to distinguish between tools that primarily build throughthe-cycle resilience against adverse financial developments and those  primarily intended  to lean against financial excesses.12   Building Resilience  Tools that build resilience aim to make the financial system better able to withstand unexpected adverse developments."
"12 The IMF recently discussed  tools to build resilience and lean against excesses ( and provided a broad overview of macroprudential tools and their interaction with other policies, including monetary policy ); see  International Monetary Fund (2013),  Key Aspects of Macroprudent ial Policy  (Washington:  IMF, June 10), www.imf.org/external/np/pp/eng/2013/061013b.pdf ."
"   Implications for Monetary Policy, Now and in the Future  In light of the  considerable efforts under way to implement a macroprudential approach to enhance financial stability and the increased focus of policymakers on monitorin g emerging financial stability risks , I see three key princip les that should guide the intera ction of monetary policy and macroprudential policy in the United States."
" First, it is critical for regulators to complete their efforts at implementing a macroprudential approach to  enhance resilience within the financial system , which will minimize the likelihood that monetary policy will need to focus on financial stability issues rather than on price stability and full employment ."
" The limitations of macroprudential policies reflect the potential for risks to emerge outside sectors subject to  regulation, the potential  for supervision and regulation to miss emerging  risks, the uncertain efficacy of new macroprudential tools such as a countercyclical capital buffer , and the potential for such policy steps  to be delayed or to lack public support.14  Given such limitations , adjustments in monetary polic y may, at times, be need ed to curb  risks to financial stability.15 These first two principles will be more effective in helping to address financial stability  risks when the public understands how monetary policymakers are wei ghing such risks in the setting of monetary policy."
" Because these issues are both new and complex, there is no simple rule that can prescribe , even in a general sense,  how monetary policy should adjust in response to shifts in the outlook for financial st ability."
" As a result, policymakers should clearly and consistently communicate their views on the stability of the financial system and how those views are influencing the stance of monetary policy."
" To that end, I will briefly lay out  my current assessment of f inancial stability risks and their relevance, at this time, to the stance of monetary policy  in the United States."
" In recent years, accommodative monetary policy has contributed to low  interest rates, a flat 14 For a related discussion , see Elliott, Feldberg, and Lehnert,  “The History of Cyclical Macroprudential Policy in the United States .” 15 Adam and Woodford (2013) present a model in which macroprudential policies are not present and housing prices experience swings for reasons not driven by “fundamentals .”  In this context, adjustments in monetary policy in response to house price booms --even if such adjustments lead to undesirable inflation or employment outcomes --are a component of optimal monetary policy."
"  See Klaus Adam and Michael Woodford (2013), “Housing Prices and Robustly Optimal Monetary Policy,” working paper, June 29, http://adam.vwl.uni -mannheim.de/fileadmin/user_upload/adam/research/AW_AssetPrices.pdf ."
" Overall , nonfinancial credit growth remains moderate, while leverage in the financial system , on balance, is much reduced."
"  Taking all of these factors into consideration, I do not presently see a need for monetary policy to deviate from a primary focus on attaining price stability and maximum employment, in order  to address financial stability concerns."
" In addition, terms and conditions  in the leveraged -loan market, which provides credit to lower -rated companies , have eased significantly, reportedly as a result of a “reach for yield” in the face of persistently low interest rates."
"  It is therefore important that  we monitor  the degree to which  the macrop rudential steps we have tak en have built sufficient resilience , and  that we consider the deployment of other tools, including adjustments to the stance of monetary policy, as conditions change in potentially unexpected ways ."
