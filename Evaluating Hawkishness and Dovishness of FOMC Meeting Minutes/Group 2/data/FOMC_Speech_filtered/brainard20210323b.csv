" T he change in the SEP med ian suggests  an improvement in the projected level of gross domestic product of  6 percent at the end of 2021 and 2022 , a decline in the unemployment rate of 2 percentage points at the end of  2021 and 11/2 percentage points at the end of  2022, and an upwar d revision to  the headline inflation rate of 0.8 percentage point at the end of 2021 that narrows to a 0.3 percentage point upward revision at the end of 2022.2  The expected improvements in  the outlook reflect progress on controlling the virus, nearly $3 trillion in additional fiscal support, and forceful and timely support from  monetary policy."
"  Although the outlook has brightened considerab ly, the fog of uncertainty associated with the virus has yet to lift completely , and current employment and inflation outcomes remain far from our goals."

" Although the unemployment rate has moved down 1/2 a percentage point since December , the Kshaped labor market recovery  remains  uneven across racial groups, industries, and wage levels.4  The employment -topopulation (EPOP ) ratio for Black prime -age workers is 7.2 percentage points lower than for w hite workers, while the EPOP ratio is 6.2 percentage points lower for Hispanic workers than for w hite workers —an increase in each gap of about 3 percentage points  from pre -crisis lows  in October 2019."

"     - 3 - Workers in the lowest -wage quartile continue d to face stag gering levels of unemployment of around 22 percent in February, reflecting the disproportionate concentration of lower -wage jobs in services sectors still sidelined by social distancing.5  The leisure and hospitality sector is still down almost 3.5 millio n jobs, or roughly 20 percent of its pre -COVID level ."
" Overall, w ith 9.5 million fewer jobs than pre -COVID levels, we are far from our broadbased and inclusive maximum -employment goal."
 Inflation similarly remains far from  the goal of 2 percent inflation on average over time.
Both headline and core PCE inflation were  below 2 percent on a 12month basis  throughout 2020 and came in at 1.5 percent  in January .
"  Finally, while vaccinations are continuing a t an accelerating pace, over two -thirds of the adult population have yet to receive their first dose , and there are risks from more contagious strains of the virus, social -distancing fatigue, and v accine hesitancy .6   Outlook  As the economy reopens , the potential release of  pentup demand  could drive stronger growth in 2021 than we have seen in decades."
" With PCE accounting for roughly 70 percent of the economy, this uncertainty about consumption spending contributes to uncertainty about  activity, employment, and inflation."

"  On the other side , there is potential for  some  leakage abroad  if, as anticipated, foreign demand  growth in some regions is weaker than in the United States."
" As port congestion and supply chain bottlenecks ease , international spillovers could lead to  some slippage between the increase in domestic  demand and resourc e utilization, which has implications for employment and inflation ."

"  Although core and headline PCE inflation came in at 1.5 percent on a 12mont h basis in January , the well -anticipated base effects from price declines in March and April of last year will cause inflation to move above 2 percent in April and May."
" It also seems likely that a surge  of demand may be met by some transitory supply bottlenecks amid a rapi d reopening of the economy, leading PCE inflation to rise somewhat  above 2 percent on a transitory basis by the end of 2021."
  Entrenched inflation dynamics are likely to  take over following the transitory pressures associated with reopening.

" Thus, as resource utilization continue s to tighten over coming years, recent decades provide little evidence to suggest there will be  a material nonlinear effect on price inflation ."
Policy  The FOMC has  communicated its reaction function under the new  framework and provided powerful  forward guidance that is  conditioned on employment and inflation outcomes.
 This approach implies  resolute patience while the  gap closes between current conditions and the maximumemployment and average inflation outcomes in the guidance.
"  By focusing on eliminating shortfalls from maximum e mployment rather than deviations in either direction and on the achievement of inflation that averages 2 percent over time, monetary policy can take a patient approach rather than a preemptive approach ."
 The preemptive approach that calls for a reduction of accommodation when  the unemployment rate nears estimates of its neutral rate in anticipation of high inflation risks an unwarranted loss of opportunity for many of the most economically vulnerable Americans and entrenching inflation  9 Statistical models estimate that underlying core PCE inflation ranges from one - to four -tenths of 1 percentage point below the 2 percent longer -run target.

" Similarly , in the January 2021 surveys,  the median respondent expected a 12 -month headline PCE inflation rate of 2.2 to 2.3 percent at the time of liftoff, as compared to roughly 0.5 percent  in the March 2015 surveys."
  The most recent ly available  surveys  suggest that market  participant s expect policy to look through the rolling off of base effects as well as p ossible  transitory  price incr eases due to short -term supplydemand imbalances .
"The FOMC has  stated that in order to anchor inflation expectations at 2 percent, it  seeks to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time."
 This language recognizes that the public’s expectations of inflation are linked to the experience of inflation outcomes.
" In the nine years since the Committee formally defined price stability as annual PCE inflation of 2 percent, the average 12 -month PCE inflation reading has been 1.4 percent."

"     - 8 - the risk that households and businesses come to expect inflation to run persistently below target and change their behavior in ways that reinforce low  inflation .12   With  inflation  expected to rise above 2 percent on a transitory basis , I will be closely monitoring a dashboard of indicators to assess that  inflation expectations remain well anchored  at levels consistent with the Committee’s objective ."
" These indicators  include  survey and market -based measures, along with composite  measures like the staff’s I ndex of Common Inflation Expectations.13  Survey measures have picked up a little but remain around pre -COVID levels."
" Meanwhile, f iveand 10year TIPS  (Treasury InflationProtected Securities) -based measures  of inflation compensation have moved up almost  1 percentage point since last summer  and are now at levels last seen in 2013 and 2014."
 These changes likely reflect both the improvement in the anticipated outlook and market participants’ understanding of the Committee’s new reaction function.14   The o verall pricestability objective of achieving inflation that averages 2 percent over time provides an important guidepost for assessing  the path of inflation .

" By  taking a patient approach  based on outcomes  rather than a preemptive approach  based on the outlook, policy will be more effective in achieving  broadbased and inclusive maximum employment and inflation that averages 2 percent over time."
" The combination o f patient monetary policy,  together with accelerating progress on vaccinations and substantial fiscal s timulus , should support a  strong and inclusive recovery as the economy reopens fully."
"    15 For instance, even with the strongest SEP inflation projection since  the Committee established its 2 percent inflation objective , the median projection from the current SEP is not quite strong enough to gene rate inflation that averages 2 percent from the time the federal funds rate moved to the lower bound through the end of the forecast horizon, which is a key considerat ion under a Temporary Price Level Targeting framework."
