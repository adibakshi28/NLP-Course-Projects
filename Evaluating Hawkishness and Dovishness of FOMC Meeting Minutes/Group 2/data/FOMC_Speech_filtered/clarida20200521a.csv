"For release on delivery  1:00 p.m. EDT   May 21 , 2020         U.S. Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy     Remarks by  Richard H."
" Current Economic Situation and Outlook  While the c oronavirus (COVID19) pandemic has taken a tragic human toll  measured in terms of lives lost and suffering inflicted, as a direct result of the necessary public health policies put in place to mitigate and control the spread of the virus, the pandemic has also inflicted a heavy toll on the levels of activity and employment in t he U.S. economy."
" The unemployment rate, which was at a 50year low of 3.5 percent as recently as February, surged in April by more than 10 percentage points to 14.7 percent, an 80 -year high, and it is likely to rise further in May."
" At a minimum, the easing of financial conditions is buying some time until the economy can begin to recover, growth resumes, and unemployment begins to fall."
" In my baseline view, while I do believe it will likely take some time for economic activity and the labor market                                                 2 For additional information on the Federal Reserve actions taken at the March 15 FOMC meeting , see the meeting statement, which is  available (along with statements from other FOMC meetings) on the Boardâ€™s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm ."
"  - 3 - to fully recover from the pandemic shock, I  do project right now that the economy will begin to grow and that the unemployment rate will begin to decline starting in the second half of this year."
" In terms of inflation, my projection is for the COVID -19 contagion shock to be disinflationary, not inflationary, and the data we are seeing so far are consistent with this  projection ."
" For example, core CPI ( consumer price inflation ) prices fell 0.45 percent  in April, the largest monthly decrease since the beg inning of the series in 1957."
" While the C OVID19 shock is disrupting both aggregate demand and supply, the net effect , I believe , will be for aggregate demand to decline relative to aggregate supply, both in the near term and over the medium term."
" If so,  this decrease will put downward pressure on core inflation, which was already running somewhat below our 2 percent objective when the downturn began in March."
" Moreover, as I have indicated previously, I judge that measures of longer -term inflation expect ations were, when the downturn began, at the low end of a range that I consider consistent with our 2  percent inflation  objective."
" The Policy Response  At the Federal Reserve, we take our dual -mandate obligations of maximum  employment and price stability ve ry seriously , and, since March 3,  we have deployed our entire toolkit to provide critical support to the economy during this challenging time."
" In our FOMC statements, we have indicated we expect to maintain the target range at this level until we are confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve our maximum -employment and price -stability goals."
"  - 4 - On March 16, we launched a program to purchase Treasur y securities  and agency mortgage -backed  securities  in whatever amounts needed to support smooth market functioning, thereby fostering effective t ransmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions."
 Direct fiscal support for the economy is thus also essential to sustain economic activity and complement what monetary policy cannot accomplish on its own.
"  Concluding Remarks  The coronavirus pandemic poses the most serious threat to maximum employment and, potentially , to price stability that the United States has faced in our lifetimes."
