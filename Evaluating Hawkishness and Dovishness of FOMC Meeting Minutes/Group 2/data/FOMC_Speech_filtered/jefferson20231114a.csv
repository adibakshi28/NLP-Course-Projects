" Indeed, as a monetary policymaker, the subject is rarely far from my mind."
" In addition, in 2003, Alan Greenspan observed, “Uncertainty is not just an important feature of the monetary policy landscape; it is th e defining characteristic of that landscape” (Greenspan, 2003)."
"  My plan is to talk about recent advances in how to measure uncertainty , what may cause uncertainty , what effect uncertainty may have on economic outcomes, and the conduct of monetary policy in the presence of uncertainty."
 Defining and measuring uncertainty  Uncertainty is not directly observable in the same way inflation and economic output are observable.
" Therefore, the uncertainty measures I will discuss are a mixture of these three concepts, and a theme for me will be the necessity of monetary policymakers to consider what they don’t  know in their decisionmaking, an argument often attributed to Friedrich Hayek (1974)."
" In fact, in the past two decades, there has been tremendous growth in research devoted to the subject."
" The y showed that newspaper textbased measures are highly correlated with stock price volatility, and that higher values of these measures are associated with lower investment and employment."
" An advantage of these measures is that they are high -frequency, re altime measures that can narrow the type of uncertainty being measured by linking particular words regarding uncertainty to a specific topic, such as inflation or monetary policy."
" Consistent with this measure, policymakers, including Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC)  participants and central bankers around the globe, have been emphasizing the elevated level of uncertainty, especially related to inflation, and the challenge this poses for monetary policy."
" Since the onset of the pandemic, most FOMC participants have be en indicating in the Summary of Economic Projections that they view uncertainty around their forecast of personal consumption expenditure inflation to be higher than the average level o f uncertainty over the past 20 years."
" The July 2023 and September 2023 issues of the Federal Reserve Beige Book, which summarize s the commentary on current economic conditions of businesses, repeat the  - 5 - words “uncertain” and “uncertainty” much more than the historical average and with much of the uncertainty associated with inflation.2   In contrast to policymakers and commentary from businesses and the econometricbased U.S. economic uncertainty measure, the other two uncertainty measures in figure 1 —the VIX index, the black line, and the newsbased economic policy uncertainty measure, th e blue line—declined quickly after the onset of the pandemic in 2020 and have remained relatively subdued since then."
" The subcomponents are inflation indicators, the black line; labor market conditions, the red line; a nd economic output, the blue line."
"  - 7 - during the pandemic but have behaved quite differently since 2021, with inflation uncertainty becoming the dominant source of aggregate economic uncertainty, especially since the Russian invasion of Ukraine."
" A message one could take from this is that, through the eyes of an econometrician with a rich set of predictors, inflation over the past two years was objectively difficult to predict."
  The rise in inflation and inflation uncertainty in the postCOVID era has been a global phenomenon.
" The right panel of slide 7, figure 4.2, shows the components of foreign economic uncertainty:  inflation, the black line; labor, the red line; and output, the blue line."
" Again, as in the U.S., foreign inflation uncertainty has become the dominant source of economic uncertainty."
 Economic theory offers at least two channels for uncertainty to influence growth negatively.4  The first channel comes from the “real options” literature and the fact that the option value of waiting to make  4 Economic theory also offers at least two channels for uncertainty to influence growth positively.
" The “growth options” theory argues that uncertainty can encourage investment if it increases the potential prize (BarIlan and Strange, 1996)."
" In the  presence of financial constraints, these tighter financial conditions will reduce economic growth (for example, Christiano, Motto, and Rostagno, 2014)."
"Because uncertainty can influence growth negatively, policymakers often aim to reduce uncertainty about their objectives."
" This point leads me to my final topic, the conduct of monetary policy in the presence of uncertainty."
" In 1967, William Brainard argued that uncertainty about the power of monetary policy implied that policy should respond more cautiously to shocks than would be the case if this uncertainty did not exist (Brainard, 1967)."
 Brainard’s attenuation principle  is  - 9 - a classic example of what has come to be known as the Bayesian approach to uncertainty and is often cited as the foundation for gradualism in the adjustment of monetary policy:  Calculate what you think your best policy response is for the economy you observe—and then do less.
 One case of perennial interest to central bankers is inflation persistence where both the Bayesian and ambiguity aversion approaches tend to l ead to policy that is stronger than the certainty equivalent case to forestall the possibility of inflationary forces becoming embedded in inflation expectations.6  5 See Barlevy (2011) for an accessible survey and Tetlow and von zur Muehlen (2001) for a more technical treatment.
 Adam and Woodford (20 12) show that uncertainty regarding the data generating process for inflation in the New Keynesian model retains as the optimal policy the same general form as in the standard model but with a more aggressive response to inflation.
" Monetary policymakers need to consider what they don’t  know in their decisionmaking, along with what they do know."
 The fact that economic agents are uncertain about their  environment and must learn about the economy —and policy—means that monetary policy can be a positive force in stabilizing expectations.
