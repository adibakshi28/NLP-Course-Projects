"More recently,  renter s and t heir f amilies have s truggled w ith inflation."
" While rent  inflation  has eased,  prices for renters seeking  new leases grew by 18 percent in 2021 compare d to 2 percent in 2019."
 This price growth has strained renters’ budge ts.
" These increased co st pressures underscore the importance of  the Federal R eserve’s efforts to  - 3 - fight inflation, which can compl ement efforts to address other factors affecting rent prices, including increasing the supply of rental housing."
 I hope that these conversations can lead to identifying evidence -based  solutions  to meet the demand for affordable housing that is so crucial in maintaining  vibrant communities.
