"The Case for Liquidity Regulation One of the primary economic functio ns of banks and other financial intermediaries, such as brokerdealers, is to provide liquidity--that is, cash on demand--in various forms to their customers."
" Some of this liquidity provision happens on the liability side of the balance sheet, with bank demand deposits being a leading example."
" For example, in the CAMELS ratings used by supervisors, the “L” stands for “liquidity.”  - 4 -probably not a coincidence that these two pr oducts--demand deposits and credit lines--are offered under the roof of the same institution; the underlying commonality is that both require an ability to accommodate unpredictable requests for cash on short notice.4  A number of other financial intermediary serv ices, such as prime brokerage, also embody a significant element of liquidity provision."
" On the liability side, demand deposits and other shortterm bank liabilities are safe, easyto-value claims that are well suited for transaction pur poses and hence create a flow of moneylike benefits for their holders.5  And loan commitments are more efficient than an arrangement in which each operating firm hedges its future uncertain needs by “preborrowing” and hoarding the proceeds on its own balance sheet; this latter approach does a poor job of economizing on the scarce aggregate supply of liquid assets.6 At the same time, as the financial crisis  made painfully clea r, the business of liquidity provision inevitably exposes financia l intermediaries to various forms of run risk."
" Demand deposits may also represent a form of insurance against liquidity shocks, as argued in Douglas W."
" That is, when the bank offers a lot of liquidity on demand to its customers but fail s to hold an adequate buffer of HQLA, this is when it imposes spillover costs on the rest of the financial system."
" And, crucia lly, this HQLA premium is determined in market equilibrium and depends on the total s upply of safe assets in  the system, relative to the demand for those assets."
" The analysis here has a number of moving parts b ecause in addition to the implementation of the LCR, substantial increases in demand for safe assets will arise from new margin requirements for both cleared and noncleared de rivatives."
"  In particular, quantitative impact studies released by the Basel Committee estimate that the worldwide incrementa l demand for HQLA coming from both the implementation of the LCR and swap margin requirements might be on the order of $3 trillion.13  This is a large number, but it compares with a global supply of HQLAeligible                                                  13 To be more precise, global incremental demand comi ng from swap margin requirements is estimated at $1.24 trillion; see Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and Board of the International Organization of Securities Commissions (2013), Margin Requirements for NonCentrally Cleared Derivatives:  Second Consultative Document  (Basel:  Bank for International Settlements and IOSCO, February), www.bis.org/publ/bcbs242.htm."
" In addition, global incremental demand coming from the LCR is estimated at $2.39 trillion; see Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (2012), Results of the Basel III Monitoring Exercise as of 30 June 2011  (Basel:  Bank for International Settlements, April),  - 12 -assets of more than $40 trillion.14  Moreover, the eligible collateral for swap margin is proposed to be broader than the LCR’s de finition of HQLA--including, for example, certain equities and corporat e bonds without any cap."
" If one focuses just on U.S. institutions, the incremental demand number is  on the order of $1 trillion, while the sum of Treasury, agency, and agency mortgageb acked securities is more than $19 trillion.15   While this sort of analysis is superfic ially reassuring, the fact remains that the HQLA premium will depend on marketequilibrium considerations that are hard to fully fathom in advance, and that are likely to vary  over time."
 Extrapolating this result to  the global level suggests that incremental demand resulting from the LCR will fall by roughly $800 billion to $1.6 trillion.
