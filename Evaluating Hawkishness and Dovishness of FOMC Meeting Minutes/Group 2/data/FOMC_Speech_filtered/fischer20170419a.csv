" In my remarks, I  will discuss how U.S. monetary policy actions affect our foreign trading partners, with particular focus on how foreign economies have responded to the Federal  Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) ongoing normalization of policy rates.1   Spillovers from the Fed’s  Unconventional Policies  Extensive empirical research on spillovers --including by Federal Reserve and International M onetary F und (IMF) staff members --indicate s that spillovers from the actions of major central banks occur through several important channel s.2  While the exchange rate is a key channel of transmission and gets a great deal of attention in the public debate about monetary spillovers, it  is not the only channel."
 U.S. monetary policy also affects foreign economies by influencing U.S. domestic demand and by affecting global financial conditions.
"    My reading of the evidence is that the Fed’s highly accommodative monetary policy during the G lobal Financial Crisis and its aftermath probably raised foreign gross domestic product (GDP) overall.3  While U.S. monetary easing caused the dollar to depreciate, which reduced foreign GDP by shifting demand toward cheaper U.S. goods, foreign economies benefited from a stronger expansion in U.S. domestic demand."
"    3 My November 11, 2016,  speech (Fischer, 2016) provides a more detailed discussion of spillovers from U.S. monetary policy, including some quantitative estimates that draw on the analysis of Ammer and others  (2016)."
"  Because the advanced foreign economies (AFEs) also experienced slow growth after the financial crisis, their central banks adopted similar policies."
" By contrast, the Fed’s accommodative policies put furthe r upward pressure on asset prices and currencies in some emerging market economies (EMEs) that were already experiencing rapid output growth."
" Thus, EME central banks had to navigate between tightening policy more --and hurting exports through a bigger exchange rate appreciation --and maintaining an accommodative stance closer to the Fed’s, but with a higher risk of overheating.4  These tradeoffs faced by EME central banks underscore some of the challenges posed by monetary policy divergence with the United S tates--a tradeoff with which I am personally very familiar."
"   Spillovers from Recent Policy Tightening  Monetary policy divergence remains a familiar theme today, but the focus has obviously shifted to the consequences of tighter U.S. monetary policy for th e global economy."
 Policy divergence is an ongoing concern given that most AFEs and many EMEs have continued to pursue highly accommodative monetary policies that remain appropriate in light of their weaker cyclical positions and subdued levels of underlyi ng inflation.
" Subsequently, the expectation that a stea dily improving U.S. labor market would call for tighter U.S. monetary policy --and hence imply greater monetary divergence with our trading partners --helped drive a sharp                                                  4  For a more detailed discussion, see Fischer  (2016)  and Bernanke (2015)."
" In Europe, unemployment has fallen steadily ; inflation and inflation expectations are moving toward central bank targets ; and, while Brexit entails many unknowns , so far it has not resul ted in significant financial market disruptions."
" China’s economy also appears to be on a more solid footing, which has helped stabilize the renminbi as well as support growth in other EMEs.     The IMF staff has taken these developments into account in the  April  2017 World Economic Outlook  (WEO) and forecasts  that world GDP growth will be noticeably higher over the next two years than in 2016-- a slight  upward revision relative to the  - 4 - October 2016 WEO.5  There may well even be some chance that foreign econom ies kick into gear enough that U.S. and foreign business conditions become reasonably well  aligned, as occurred during the U.S. monetary tightening cycles that began in 1999 and in 2004."
"  However, even if monetary policy divergence remains substantial, there is good reason to t hink that spillovers to foreign economies will be manageable."
" Third, many EMEs h ave markedly improved fundamentals --including smaller current account deficits and more anchored inflation expectations --that should allow them to better withstand the effects of U.S. tightening, though some vulnerabilities remain."
"  - 5 - Finally, I expect that  U.S. policy normalization will be gradual under likely scenarios for the evolution of output and inflation."
