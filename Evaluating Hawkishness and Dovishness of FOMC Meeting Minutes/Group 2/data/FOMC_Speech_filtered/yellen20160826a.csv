"For release on delivery  10:00 a.m. E DT (8:00 a.m. MDT) August  26, 2016         The Federal Reserve’s Monetary Policy Toolkit :  Past, Present , and Future     Remarks by   Janet L."
"Yellen   Chair   Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at   “Designing Resilient Monetary Policy Frameworks for the Future”   a symposium  sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City   Jackson Hole, Wyoming         August 26 , 2016   The Global Financial Crisis and Great Recession posed daunting new challenges for central banks around the world and spurred innovations  in the design, implementation, and communication of monetary policy."
" With the U.S. economy now nearing the Federal Reserve’s statutory goals of maximum employment and price stabilit y, this conference provides a timely opportunity to consider how the lessons we learned are likely to influence the conduct of monetary policy in the future."
" The theme of th e conference, “Designing Resilient Monetary Policy Frameworks for the Future,” enco mpasses many aspect s of monetary policy, from the nitty -gritty details  of implement ing policy in financial markets to broader questions about how policy affects the economy."
" As noted in the minutes of last month’s F ederal Open Market Committee (FOMC)  meeting, we are  studying many issues related to  policy implementation, research which ultimately will inform the FOMC’s views on how to most effectively conduct  monetary policy in the years ahead."
  My focus  today will be the policy tool s that are needed to ensure that we have a resilient monetary policy framework.
" Looking ahead, we will likely need to retain  - 2 - many of the monetary policy tools that were developed to promote recovery from the crisis ."
"Current Economic Situation and Outlook   U.S. e conomic activity continues to expand, led by solid growth in household spending ."
 But  business investment remains soft and subdued foreign demand and the appreciation of the dollar since mid -2014 continue  to restrain exports.
" While economic growth has not been rapid, it has been sufficient to generate further improvement in the labor market."
" Alt hough the unemployment rate has remained fairly steady this year, near 5 percent, broader measures of labor utilization have improved."
" Inflation has continued to run below the FOMC’s objective of 2 percent, reflect ing in part  the transitory effects of ear lier declines in energy and import prices."
" Looking ahead, the FOMC expect s moderate growth in real gross domestic product (GDP), additional strengthening in the labor market, and inflation rising to 2 percent over the next few years."
" Based on this economi c outlook, the FOMC continues to anticipate that  gradual increases in the federal funds rate will be appropriate over time to achieve and sustain employment  and inflation near our statutory objectives ."
" Indeed, in light of the continued solid performance of the labor market and our outlook for economic activity and inflation, I believe the case for an increase in the federal funds rate  - 3 - has strengthened in recent months ."
" And, a s ever, the economic outlook is uncertain , and so monetary policy is not on a preset course ."
 Our ability to predict how the federal funds rate will evolve over time is quite limited bec ause monetary policy will need to respond to whatever disturbances may buffet the economy.
" In addition, the level of short -term interest rates consistent with the dual mandate varies over time in response to shifts in underlying economic conditions that a re often evident only in hindsight."
" When shocks occur and the economic outlook changes, monetary policy needs                                                  1 The June 2016 Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) is an addendum to the minutes of the June 2016 FOMC meeting and is available  on the Board’s website  at www.feder alreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20160615.pdf ."
" The Pre -Crisis Toolkit   Prior to the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy toolkit was simple but effective  in the circumstances that then prevailed ."
" Our main tool consisted of open market operations to manage the amount of reserve  balances available to  the banking sector .3  These operations, in turn, influence d the interest rate in the federal funds market, where banks experiencing reserve shortfalls could borrow from banks with excess reserves."
" Changes in the federal funds rate would then be transmitted to other short -term interest rates, affect ing longer -term interest rates  and overall financial conditions  and hence inflation and economic activity."
" This simple, light -touch system allowed the Federal Reserve to operate with a relatively small balance sheet --less than $1 trillion before the crisis --the size of which was largely determined by the  need to supp ly enough U.S. currency to meet demand.5    The global financial crisis revealed  two main shortcomings of this simple toolkit."
"  Of course, by the end of 2008, stabilizing the federal funds rate at a level materially above zero wa s not an immediate concern  because the economy clearly needed very low short -term interest rates ."
" Faced with a steep rise in unemployment and declining inflation, the FOMC lowered its target for the federal funds rate to near zero, a reduction of roughly 5 percentage points over the previous year  and a half ."
" Our Expanded Toolkit   To address the challenges posed by the financial crisis and the subsequent severe recession and slow recovery, the Federal Reserve significantly expanded its monetary policy  toolkit ."
" In particular, once economic conditions warrant a higher level for market  interest rates, the Federal Reserve could raise the interest rate paid on excess reserves --the IOER rate."
"                                                  8 Consider the following policy rule:  R(t) = R* + π(t) + 0.5[π(t) -π*]-2.0[U(t) -U*], where R is the federal funds rate, R* is the longer -run nor mal value of the federal funds rate adjusted for inflation, π is the four -quarter moving average of core PCE inflation, π* is the FOMC’s target for inflation (2 percent), U is the unemployment rate, and U* is the longer -run normal rate of unemployment."
" Accordingly, with the unemployment rate climbing to 10 percent and core PCE inflation falling to 1 percent in 2009, th is rul e would have prescribed lowering the federal funds rate to minus 9 percent at the depths of the recession."
"   - 7 - A higher IOER rate encourage s banks to raise the interest rates they charge, putting upward pressure on market interest rates regardless of the leve l of reserves in the banking sector."
"   While adjusting the IOER rate is an effective way to move market interest rates when reserves are plentiful, federal funds have generally traded below this rate ."
" To put a more effective floor under short -term interest rates , the Federal Reserve created supplementary tools to be used as needed ."
                                                  10 Other tools that could help strengthen the floor under short -term interest rates but are not currently in use include the Term Deposit Facility and term reverse repurchase agreements.
   - 8 - Two other major addition s to the Fed’s toolkit  were large -scale asset purchases and increasingly explicit forward guidance.11  Both were used to provid e additional mone tary policy accommodation after short -term interest rates fell close to zero .
" Extended forward rate guidance --announcing that we intended to keep short -term interest rates lower for long er than might have otherwise been expected --also put significant downward pressure on longer -term borrowing rates , as did guidance regarding the size and sco pe of our asset purchases ."
" Those headwinds included substantial household and business  deleveraging, unfavorable demand shocks  from abroad , a period of contractionary fiscal policy, and unusually tight credit, especially for hou sing."
" S tudies  have found that our asset purchase s and extended forward rate guidance put appreciable downward pressure on long -term interest rates  and, as a result, helped spur growth in demand for goods and services, lower the unemployment rate, and prev ent inflation from falling further below our 2 percent objective .12                                                   11 Prior to the crisis, the Fed occasionally used forward guidance pertaining to the likely future path of interest rates, but that guidance was usually confined to a relatively short time frame."
" W ithout IOER authority, the F ederal Reserve would have been reluctant to buy as many assets as it did  because of the longer -run implications for controlling the stance of monetary policy ."
" While we were buying assets aggressively to help bring the U.S. economy out of a severe recession, we also had to  keep in mind whether and how we would be able to remove monetary policy accommodation when appropriate."
" That issue was particularly relevant because we fund our asset purchases through the creation of reserves, and those additional reserves would have made it ever more difficult for the pre -crisis toolkit to raise short -term interest rates when needed."
 Excessive inflationary pressures could arise if assets were  sold too slowly .
" Given the uncertainty and potential costs associated with large -scale asset sales, the FOMC  instead decided to begin                                                  have helped lower unemployment and boost inflation; see Eric M."
 - 10 - removing monetary policy accommodation prima rily by adjusting short -term interest rates rather than by active ly manag ing its asset holdings.13  That strategy --raising short -term interest rates once the recovery was sufficiently advanced while maintaining a relatively large balance sheet and plentiful  bank reserves --depended on our ability to pay interest on excess reserves.
" But even after the volume of r eserves falls substantially, IOER will still be important as a contingency tool, because we may need to purchase assets during future recessions to supplement conventional interest rate reductions.14  Forecasts now show the                                                  13 The FOMC’s  “Policy Normaliza tion Principles and Plans ” call for reducing the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings in a “gradual and predictable manner primarily by ceasing to reinvest repayments of principal on securities held in the [System Open Market Account]” (Board of Governors  of the Federal Reserve System (2014), “Federal Reserve Issues FOMC Statement on Policy Normalization Principles and Plans,” press release, September 17, second bullet, www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20140917c.htm )."
"14 If the FOMC w ere to again increase the size of the balance sheet markedly in response to a future recession, then the ability to pay interest on reserves could  be critical during the subsequent recovery period to help control short -term interest rates while the balance sheet remains elevated."
" Thus, we expect to have less scope for interest rate cuts  than we have had historically ."
"    In part, current expectations for a low  future federal funds rate reflect the FOMC’s success in stabilizing inflation at around 2 percent --a rate much lower than rates that prevail ed during the 1970s and 1980s."
" Another key factor is the marked decline over the past decade, both here and abroad, in the long -run neutral real rate of interest --that is, the inflation -adjusted short -term interest  rate consistent with keeping output at its  potential on average over time.16  Several developments could have contributed to this apparent decline, including slower growth in the working -age populations of many countries, smaller productivity gains in the advanced economies, a decreased propensity to spend in the wake of the financial crises around the world since the late 1990s, and                                                  system  during a future emergency."
" In particular, such facilities could significantly expand the supply of reserves , which would be problematic if the FOMC wished to keep short -term interest rates from falling to zero."
16 Updated estimates from the model deve loped by Laubach and Williams (2003) indicate that the real longrun neutral or “equilibrium” short -term interest rate in the United States is currently about 21/2 percentage points lower than it was on average in the 1980s and 1990s (see Thomas Laubach a nd John C.
"    - 12 - perhaps a paucity of attractive capital projects worldwide.17  Although these factors may help explain why bond yields have fallen to such low levels here and abroad, ou r understanding of the forces driving long -run trends in interest rates is nevertheless limited, and thus all predictions in this area are highly uncertain .18   Would an average federal funds rate of about 3 percent impair the Fed’s ability to fight recessi ons?"
" Based on the F OMC ’s behavior in past recessions, one might think that such a low interest rate could substantially impair policy effectiveness."
" In most cases, t his tighterthan-normal  stance of policy before                                                  17 For a discussion of the possible role played by these factors in explaining the current low l evel of interest rates in the United States and other advanced economies, see Lawrence H."

   - 13 - the recession appears to have reflected some combination of initially higher -thannormal labor utilization and elevated inflation pressures.
" As a result, a large portion of the rate cuts that subsequently occurred during  these recessions represent ed the undoing of the earlier tight  stance  of monetary policy."
" But if it did, the federal funds rate at the onset of the recession would be well above its normal level, and the FOMC would be able to cut short -term interest rates by substantially more than 3 percentage points."
" For one, the model’s structure allows the public’s expectations for interest rates, in flation, and other factors to take full account of the implications of the effective lower bound on nominal interest rates, changes in future monetary policy as signaled by forward guidance, and asset purchases."
" In addition, the model incorporates the low  responsiveness of inflation to movements in resource utilization seen in recent years as well as the effects of asset purchases on term premiums, and thus a variety of longer -term interest rates, equity prices, and the foreign exchange value of the dollar ."
"0 + π(t) + 0.5 [π(t) -2] - 2.0 [U(t)  - 4.8], where R is the federal funds rate, π is the four -quarter moving average of core PCE inflation, and U is the unemployment rate  [Note:  On August 30, 2016, a typo in the equation for the aggressive rule was corrected to change “[4.8  - U(t)]” to “[U(t) - 4.8]” ]."
" Note that baseline values of the equilibrium real rate, the natural rate of unemployment, and the target rate of inflation used in the simulation analysis --1.0 percent, 4.8 percent, and 2.0 percen t, respectively --are consistent with the medians of the latest long -run projections of individual FOMC participants."
" As discussed by Taylor (1999), this rule appears to do a good job in stabilizing real activity and inflation in a wide range of economic m odels ( see John B."
"Taylor, ed., Monetary Policy Rules  (Chicago:  University of Chicago Press), pp."
" It shows simulated paths for interest rates, the unemployment rate, and inflation under three different monetary policy responses --the aggressive rule in the absence of the zero lower bound constraint, the constrained aggressive rule, and the constrained aggressive rule combined with $2  trillion in asset purchases and guidance that the federal funds rate will depart from the rule by staying lower for longer.21  As the red dashed line shows, the federal funds rate would fall far below zero if policy w ere unconstrained, thereby causing long -term interest rates to fall sharply.i  But despite the lower bound, asset purchases and forward guidance can push long -term interest rates even lower on average than in the unconstrained case  (especially when adjusted for inflation) by reducing term premiums and increasing the downward pressure on the expected average valu e of future short -term interest rates."
" Thus, the use of such tools could result in even better outcomes for unemployment and inflation  on average ."
" For one, the FRB/US simulations may overstate the effec tiveness of forward guidance and asset purchases, particularly in an environment where long -term interest rates are also likely to be unusually low.22  In                                                  21 The forward guidance is provided at the start of the recession and has three components."
" Second, the federal funds rate will remain at zero as long as the unemployment rate is greater than 5 percent."
"   22 As shown in figure 2, the 10 -year Treasury yield in the simulation starts out at just over 4 percent, well below its level pre -crisis, suggesting that there may be less room to push down long -term interest rates in the future than in the past."
" Another potential source of overstatement could be the FRB/US assumption that  - 15 - addition, policymakers could have less ability to cut short -term interest rates in the future than the  simulations assume."
" By some calculations, the real neutral rate is currently close to zero, and it could remain at this low level if we were to continue to see slow productivity growth and high global saving.23  If so, then the average level of the nomina l federal funds rate down the road might turn out to be only 2 percent, implying that asset purchases and forward guidance might have to be pushed to extremes to compensate.24  Moreover, relying too heavily on these nontraditional tools could have unintende d consequences."
"     Finally, the simulation analysis certainly overstates the FOMC’s current  ability to respond to a recession, given that there is little scope to cu t the federal funds rate at the                                                  changes in long -term interest rates, whether driven by shifts in term premiums or sh ifts in the expected path of short -term interest rates, have the same influence on real activity, as there is some empirical evidence that the estimated sensitivity of spending to movements in term premiums alone may be relatively small; see Michael T."

"23 In principle, the federal funds rate in the longer run could  also turn out to be lower than currently predicted if inflation were to remain persistently below 2 percent."
" However, because a higher rate of inflation can arguably be achieved over time through a sufficiently tight labor market, this ri sk seems low to me as long as the Federal Reserve is committed to achieving its inflation objective."
" In addition to taking the federal funds rate back down to nearly zero, the FOMC could resume asset purchases and announce its intention to keep the federal funds rate at this level  until conditions had improved markedly --although with long -term interest rates already quite low, the net stimulus that would result m ight be somewhat reduced ."
"On the monetary policy  side, future policymakers might  choose to  consider some additional tools that have been employed by other central banks, though adding them to our toolkit would require a very careful weighing of costs and benefits  and, in some cases, could require legislation ."
" Beyond that, some observers  have suggested raising the FOMC’s 2 percent inflation objective or implementing policy through alternative monetary policy frameworks, such as price -level or nominal GDP targeting."
"  - 17 - Beyond monetary policy, fiscal policy has traditionally played an important role in dealing with severe economic downturn s."
"    Finally, and most ambitiously, as a society we s hould explore ways to raise productivity growth ."
 Stronger productivity growth would tend to raise the average level of interest rates and therefore would provide the Federal Reserve with greater scope to ease monetary policy in the event of a recession.
" But m ore importantly, stronger productivity growth would enhance Americans’ living standards."
" Though outside the narrow field of monetary policy, m any possibilities in this arena are worth considering, including improving our educational system and invest ing more in worker training; promoting capital investment and research spending, both private and public; and looking for ways to reduce regulatory burdens while protecting important economic, financial, and social goals."
"  - 18 - Although  fiscal policies and structural reforms can play an important role in strengthening  the U.S. economy, my primary message today is that I expect monetary policy will continue to play a vital part in promoting a stable and healthy economy."
" But even if average  interest rates  remain lower than in the past, I believe  that monetary policy  will, under most conditions,  be able to respond effectively ."
"i Note:  On August 29, 2016 , a typo was corrected to change the line color cited from “blue” to “red” in the following sentence:  “As the red dashed line shows, the federal funds rate would fall far below zero if policy were unconstrained, thereby causing long -term interest rates to fall sharply."
