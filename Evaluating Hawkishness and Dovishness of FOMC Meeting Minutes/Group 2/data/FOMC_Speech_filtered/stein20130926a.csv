"Stein   Member   Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at  “Banking, Liquidity and Monetary Policy”   a Symposium Sponsor ed by the Center for Financial Studies  in Honor of Raghuram Rajan   Frankfurt, Germany         September 26, 2013    Let me start by thanking the organizers for including me in this event."
"  I would like to talk briefly about some recent research of mine, done jointly with Sam Hanson of Harvard Business School, on the monetary transmission mechanism.1  As will become clear, our work is heavily influenced by some of R aghu’s earlier writing, and in particular his famous 2005 Jackson Hole paper.2  After describing what we find, I will try to draw some connections to the current monetary policy environment as well as some lessons about the interplay of monetary policy and  financial stability."
" In our paper, Sam and I begin by documenting the following fact about the working of conventio nal monetary policy :  Changes in the stance of policy have surprisingly strong effects on very distant forward real interest rates."

" - 2 - path of the federal funds rate over the following several quarters --is associated with a 42 basis  point increase in the 10 -year forwa rd overnight real rate, extracted from the yield curve for Treasury inflation -protected securities (TIPS).3 On the one hand, this finding is at odds with standard New  Keynesian macro models, in which the central bank’s ability to influence real variables s tems from goods prices that are sticky in nominal terms."
" In such models, a change in monetary policy should have no effect on forward real rates at a horizon longer than that over which all prices can adjust, and it seems implausible that this hori zon cou ld be on the order of 10 years."
" On the other hand, the result suggests that monetary policy may have more kick than is implied by the standard model, precisely because long -term real rates are the ones that are most likely to matter for a variety of inves tment decisions."
" How, in a world of eventually  flexible goods prices, is monetary policy able to exert such a powerful influence on long -term real rates?"
  - 3 - This observation then raises the question of why monetary policy might be able to influence real term premiums.
" Here is where we draw our inspiration from Raghu’s work, in particular his hypothesis that low nominal interest rates can create incentives for  certain types of investors to take added risk in an effort to “reach for yield.”  While an emerging body of empirical research investigates this hypothesis in the context of credit risk--documenting that banks tend to make riskier loans when rates are low --our focus is instead on the implications of the reach -foryield mechanism on the pricing of interest  rate risk, also known as duration risk.4  The theory we sketch involves a set of “yield -oriented” investors."
" Thus , according to this theory, an easing of monetary policy affects longterm real rates not via the usual expectations channel, but rather via what might be termed a “recruitment” channel --by causing an outward shift in the demand curve of yield -oriented                                                  4 The idea that banks take on more credit risk when rates are low is explored in, for example , Gabriel Jiménez, Steven Ongena, Jos éLuis Peydr ó, and Jes ús Saurina  (forthcoming),  “Hazardous Times for Monetary Policy:  What Do 23 Million Bank Loans Say about the Effects of Monetary Policy on Credit RiskTaking?” Econometrica ."
" We also find that primary dealers in the Treasury market --who, unlike banks, must mark their securities holdings to market --take the other side of the trade, reducing  the maturity of their Treasury holdings when the yield curve steepens.5 Overall, I read this evidence as suggesting --albeit tentatively --that some mechanism involving yield -oriented investors may eventually turn out to be central to our understanding of how monetary policy works, both in ordinary and extraordinary times."
" When  I say “central, ” I mean that this mechanism may play a role not only in determining how monetary policy influences the pricing of credit risk, but also in how it shapes the real and nominal yield curves for credit -riskfree Treasury securities."
" Of course , much work remains to be done before statements like these can be made with any                                                  5 Primary dealers are broker -dealer firms that serve as trading counterparties of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in its implementation of monetary policy."
" According to this view, r eal and nominal term premi ums were low not just because we were buying longterm bonds, but becau se our policies induced an outward shift in the demand curve of other investors, which led them to do more buying on our behalf --because we both gave them an in centive to reach for yield, and at the same time provi ded a set of implicit  assurances that tamped down volatility and made it feel safer to lever aggressively in  - 7 - pursuit of that extra yield."
" In deed, my whole point in talking about the research I described earlier was to underscore my belief that something like this investor -recruitment mechanism is central to how monetary policy acquires much of its tract ion over the real economy even in ordinary times."
" But in an important sense, this effect is just a powered -up version of what makes gard envariety monetary policy work."
"  When we talk about the interplay of monetary policy and financial stability, I think that this kind of tradeoff  is an important part of what we sh ould be bearing in mind."
"  For this reason, my personal preference would be to make future step -downs a completely deterministic function of a labor market indicator, such as the unemployment rate or cumulative payroll growth over some period."
" For example, one could cut mo nthly purchases by a set amount for each further 10 basis point decline in the unemployment rate.10  Obviously the unemployment rate is not a perfect summary statistic for our labor  market objectives, but I believe that this approach would help to reduce un certainty about our reaction function and the attendant market volatility."
"10 To be clear, I am sketching out a broad concept, and many details would need to be filled  in to make it operational --such as, what to do if the unemployment rate falls in one month and then later rises."
