"For release on delivery  8:30 p.m. E ST (7:30 p.m. C ST) February 23 , 2016         Recent Monetary Policy Developments     Remarks by   Stanley Fischer   Vice Chair man  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at  “Energy Transition:  Strate gies for a New World ” 35th Annual IHS CERAWeek  Houston, Texas         February 23 , 2016    I would like to thank Daniel Yergin  for his kind invitation to speak this evening at the CERA Week conference."
"  To get things started, I thought I could provide some background on recent monetary policy decisions.1   As you all know, at our December meeting the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage point, to 1/4 to 1/2 percent.2  At our meeting in January , we decided to maintain that range."
" This ultra -low rate was in keeping with our congressional mandate to pursue a monetary policy that fosters maximum employment and price stability, which we define as 2 percent inflation."
"  Our decision in December was based on the substantial improvement in the labor market and the Committee’s confidence that inflation would r eturn to our 2 percent goal                                                  1 I am grateful to William English, Trevor Reeve, and Stacey Tevlin for their assista nce."
" Employment grow th last year averaged a solid 2 30,000 per month, and the unemployment rate declined from 5.6 percent to 5.0 percent over the course of 2015 --and declined further to 4.9 percent last month."
 This is close to the unemployment rate generally regarded as the f ull employment rate of unemployment.
"  Inflation ran well below our target last year, held down by the transitory effects of declines in crude oil prices and also in the prices of nonoil imports."
" Once these oil and import prices stop falling and level out, their effects on inflation will dissipate, which is the main reason we expect that inflation will rise to 2  percent over the medium term, supported by a further st rengthening in labor market conditions."
"Of course, with the federal funds target now at between 25 and 50 basis points, and the effective federal funds rate currently almost at the center of that target range, our monetary policy remains accommodative ."
" In particular, to raise the federal funds rate we increased the interest rate we pay on reserve balances that depository institutions hold at the Federal Reserve."
" We also employed an overnight reverse repurchase facility, through which we interact with a broad range of firms to help provide a soft floor for the federal funds rate consistent with our target range.3  These new tools have w orked well, and the federal funds rate and other short -term interest rates have increased as expected."
 The economic data that have come in since our December interest rate decision  suggest that the labor market has continued to improve.
" Although job gains slowed some last month, over the most recent three m onths payrolls have increased 230,000 jobs per mont h on average, as the unemployment rate declined."
" Moreover, the spending indicators that we have in hand for January point to a pickup in economic growth this quarter."
"  In addition, the rate of core  consumer price index  inflation over the past 12 months exceeded  2 percent, though this was not true of the core price index of personal consumption expenditures that the Fed monitors clos ely."
 However --and there is frequently a “however” in our business --further declines in oil prices suggest that total inflation will likely remain low for somewhat longer than had been previously expected before moving back to 2 percent.
" Asset price declines may also reflect a reassessment of the prospects for growth in Europe and Japan, and perhaps also a recognition that U.S. gross domestic product  and productivity growth have remained stubbornly low."
"   If the recent financial market developments lead to a sustained tightening of financial conditions, they could signal a slowing in the global economy that could affect growth and inflation in the United States."
" As Chair Yellen said in her testimony to the Congress two weeks ago, while “ global financial developments could produce a slowing in the economy, I think we want to be careful not to jump to a premature conclusion about what is in store for the U.S. economy.”   Of course, t he FOMC is closely monitoring global economic and financial developments and assessing their implications for the labor market and inflation and the balance of risks to the outlook."
The world is an uncertain place-- - 5 - sometimes more uncertain than at other times --and all monetary policymakers can really be sure of is that what will happen is often different from what we currently expect.
" That is why the Committee has indicated that its policy decisions will be data dependent , which is to say that we will adjust policy appropriately in light of economic and financial events to best foster conditions consistent with the attainment of our employment and inflation objectives."
"  First, most estimates of the full employment rate of unemployment are close to 5 percent."
" The actual rate of unemployment is now slightly below 5 percent, and the median view of the members of the FOMC is that it will decline further, per haps even to the vicinity of 4.7 percent."
 The first reason is that other measures of labor market conditions --such as the fraction of workers with part -time employment who would prefer to work full time and the number of people not actively looking for work who would like to work--indicate that more slack may remain in the labor market than the unemployment rate alone would suggest.
" And the s econd  reason is that  with inflation currently well below 2 percent, a modest overshoot could actually be helpful in moving inflation back to 2 percent more rapidly."
" Nonetheless , a persistent large overshoot of our employment mandate would risk an undesirable rise in inflation that might require a relatively abrupt  - 6 - policy tightening, which could inadvertently push the economy into recession."
 Monetary policy should aim to avoid such risks and keep th e expansion on a sustainable track.
  The second issue is how best to integrate balance sheet policy with interest rate policy.
