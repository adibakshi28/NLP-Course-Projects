" The ARRC was charged with providing the market with the tools that would be needed for a transition from LIBOR:  an alternative rate that did not share the same structural instabilities that ha ve led LIBOR to this point, a plan to develop liquidity in the derivatives market for this new rate so that cash users could hedge their interest rate risk, and models of better contract language that helped limit the risk from a LIBOR disruption."
