"For release on delivery 10:00 p.m. E ST (7:00 p.m. PST) March 8, 2019 Monetary Policy:  Normalization and the Road Ahead  Remarks by  Jerome H."
" We are therefore conducting a review of the Fed’s monetary policy strategy, tools, and communications practices."
" Balance Sheet Normalization  Between  December 2008 and October 2014, the Federal Reserve purchased $3.7 trillion in longer -term Treasury and agency  securities  in order to support the economy both by easing dislocations in market functioning and by driving down longer -term interest rates."
" During that period, the main monetary policy decision for the FOMC was choosing a target value  for the federal funds rate."
" Subject to that choice, the Fed allowed the demand for its liabilities to determine the size of the balance sheet."
" This is a feature of “normal” that we are returning to:  After normalization, the size of the Fed’s balance sh eet will once again be driven by the demand for our liabilities ."
 The Committee has long said that the size of the balance sheet will be considered normalized when t he balance sheet is once again at the smallest level consistent with conducting monetary policy efficiently and effectively.
" Just how large that will be is uncertain, because we do not yet have a clear sense of the normal level of demand for our liabilities."
 The normalized balance sheet may be smaller or larger than that estimate and will grow gradually over time as demand for currenc y rises with the economy.
" Bank reserves account for the biggest part of the growth, or about 5.6 percent of GDP ."
"    As was the case before the crisis,  the FOMC’s chosen operating regime for controlling short -term interest rates also plays a role in determining the appropriate quantity of reserves."
"  In January , the Committee  stated its intention to continue in our current regime  in which our main policy rate, the federal funds rate or possibly some successor, is he ld within its target range by the interest rates  we set on reserves  and on the overnight reverse repo facility.3  In this system, active management of the supply of reserves is not required."
" Thus, the supply of reserves must be “ample ,” in the sense of being sufficient to satisfy reserve demands even in the face of volatility in factors                                                  3 As noted in the minutes of the November 2018 FOMC meeting (see https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcminutes20181108.htm ), participants discussed costs and benefits of various alternatives to the federal funds rate, such as the overnight bank funding rate, and recommended further study of the issue."
"   - 5 - affecting the reserve market.4  Put another way, the qu antity of reserves will equal the typical  reserve demands of depositories plus a buffer to allow for reserve market fluctuations."
" S ince December 2008 , the FOMC’s postmeeting statement had contained ever -evolving  forms of guidance about keeping the federal funds rate at the                                                  4 Both supply and demand factors can show large fluctuations."
 We removed the last elements of this crisis -era guidance in January.5  The federal funds rate is now within the broad range of estimates of the neutral rate --the interest rate that tends neither to stimulate nor to restrain the econom y.
 Committee participants generally agree that this policy stance is appropriate to promote our dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability.
" Our monetary policy independence all ows us to serve the public without regard to short -term political considerations, which, as history has shown, is critical for sound monetary policymaking ."
"  - 9 - Among other initiatives , my colleagues and I on the FOMC are undertaking a yearlong review  of the Federal Reserve ’s monetary policy strategy, tools, and communication  practices ."
" We believe that our existing framework for conducting monetary policy has generally served the public well, and the review may or may not produce major changes."
" We seek no changes in law and we are not considering fundamental changes in the structure of the Fed, or in the 2 percent inflation objective."
" Can the Federal Reserve best meet its statutory objectives with its existing monetary policy strategy, or should it consider strategies that aim to reverse past m isses of the inflation objective?"
" Are the existing monetary policy tools adequate to achieve and maintain maximum employment and price stability, or should the toolkit be expanded?"
" Because interest rates around the world have steadily declined for several decades, rates in normal times now tend to be much closer to zero than in the past (figure 5) .8  Thus, when a recession comes, the Fed is likely to have less capacity to cut interest rates to stimulate the economy than in the past, suggesting that trips to the ELB may be more frequent."
" The postcrisis period has seen many economies around the worl d stuck for an extended period at the ELB, with slow growth and inflation well below target."
" Persistently weak inflation could lead inflation expectations to drift downward, which would imply still lower interest rates, leaving even less room for central banks to cut interest rates to support t he economy during a downturn."
 It is therefore very important for central banks to find more effective ways to battle the low -inflation syndrome that seems to accompany proximity to the ELB.
" In the late 1990s, motivated by the Japanese experience with deflation  and sluggish economic performance , economists began developing the argument that a central bank might substantially reduce the economic costs of ELB spell s by adopting  a makeup strategy.9  The simplest version goes like this:   If a spell with interest rates near                                                  8 For evidence on the secular decline in interest rates in the United States and abroad, see King and Low (2014); Holston, Laubach, and Williams (2017); Rachel and Smith (2017); and Brand, Bielecki, and Penalver (2018)."
"  - 11 - the ELB le ads to a persistent  shortfall of inflation relative to the central bank’s goal, once the ELB spell ends, the central bank would deliberately make up for th e lost inflation by  stimulating the economy and temporarily  pushing inflation modestly  above the target ."
" In standard macroeconomic models, if households and businesses are confident that this future inflationary stimulus will be coming, that  prospect will promote anticipato ry consumption and investment ."
" This can substantially reduce  the economic costs of ELB spells.10  Researchers have suggested many variations on makeup strategies.11 For example, the central bank could target average inflation over time, implying that misses  on either side of the target would be offset."
" For a discussion of the relationship between pricelevel targe ting and average -inflation targeting, see Nessén and Vestin  (2005)."
  Kiley and Roberts (2017 ) study a strategy in which policymakers aim for inflation higher than 2 percent during normal times to compensate for below -targe t inflation during ELB episodes.
" 13 The Bank o f Japan (2016) came closest, announcing in September 2016 an “inflation -overshooting commitment” (p."
" Part of the problem is that when the time comes to deliver the inflationary s timulus, that policy is likely to be unpopular --what is known as the time consistency problem in economics.14   Experience in the U nited States and around the world suggests that more frequent ELB episodes could prove quite costly in the future."
" Inflation will probably run a bit be low our objective for a time due to declines in energy prices, but those effects are likely to prove transitory."
" Core inflation, which is often a reliable indicator of where inflation is headed over time, is quite close to 2 percent."
" With nothing in the outlook demanding an immediate policy response and particularly given muted inflation pressures, the C ommittee has adopted a patient, wait -andsee approach to considering a ny alteration in the stance of policy."
" Considering monetary  policy more broadly, we are inviting thorough public scrutiny and are hoping to foster conversation regarding how the Fed can best exercise the precious monetary policy independence we have been g ranted."
