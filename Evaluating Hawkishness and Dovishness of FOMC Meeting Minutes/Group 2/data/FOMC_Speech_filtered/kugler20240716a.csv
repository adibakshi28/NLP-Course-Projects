" When Federal Reserve officials tell audiences that their judgments are data dependent, some skeptics perhaps presume that monetary policy is already on a path set in stone."
" I am a member of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which, of course, pursues a dual mandate of maximum employment and stable prices.1  When I say I am data dependent, that means I am considering the totality of the data —the full range of economic indicators that provide a sense of where the labor market, economic activity, financial conditions, and inflation have been and where they might be going."
" For example, the New York Fed conducts a survey of consumer expectations , which was just released last week , the Atlanta Fed tracks wage data, the Richmond Fed surveys firms on price -setting behavior, among other things, and several Reserve B anks publish alternative measures of inflation and reports on factory and business activity in their regions."
" A recent and relevant example is housing services inflation, as measured as part of the consumer  price index  (CPI) and the personal  consumption expenditure s price index."
"While servicesector output constitutes a larger  share of U.S. gross domestic product  - 5 - (GDP), the category has only one single dedicated quarterly report, even though much of the post -pandemic recovery requires us to understand how services consumption and employment have evolved."
 A prominent example of valuable private -sector data is  employment statistics from payroll providers.
" Such weekly data allowed economists at the Federal Reserve Board to understand, essentially in real time, employment losses when the pandemic first took hold in the United States in March 2020."
" In comparison, it took until early May to get similar information from the Bureau of Labor Statistics’  (BLS) employment report.4  Indeed, in trying to understand the rapidly changing economy during the pandemic, Fed economists closely followed a variety of privately produced higher -frequency data."

" Those include surveys of expectations of future inflation, anticipated hiring or layoffs, and consumer and business sentiment on the economy or the path of the economy."

" That is why I also look at other figures, including unemployment insurance claims ; Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification, or WARN, notices ; employment reductions from the Institute for Supply  8 See Bureau of Labor Statistics (2024), “ Household and E stablishment Survey Response Rates,” webpage, https://www.bls.gov/osmr/response -rates/home.htm ."
" With inflation, an important component to track recently has been housing services costs, which is typically the single largest expense for U.S. households."
 Housing services are a big reason why the overall inflation rate remains above our 2 percent targe t.
" The official measures of housing services inflation are intended to capture overall growth of housing costs —that is, cost s incurred by owners and renters —drawing from a survey of rental lease terms."
 Those data can provide some early signal of where official housing inflation series are likely headed.
" - 11 - staff and relies on new business applications for Employer Identification Numbers , or EINs .12  During the early months of the pandemic, weekly data from the BFS provided a timely indicator of the initial d ecline in economic activity, and then later the figures likewise documented the rebound.13 Another measurement invention was created during the early months of the pandemic:  the Census Bureau’s highfrequency “Pulse” surveys —one each for households and businesses."
" The survey has adapted over time as the health and economic situations have evolved, incorporating questions about vaccination, access to infant formula during a product shortage, inflation, and other issues."
" The Small Business Pulse  Survey provided timely information about employment, revenue, financial conditions , and expectations for future growth, survival, and needs in the highly  12 See Kimberly Bayard, Emin Dinlersoz, Timothy Dunne, John Haltiwanger, Javier Miranda, and John Stevens (2018 ), “Early -Stage Business Formation:  An Analysis of A pplications for Employer Identification Numbers ,” NBER Working P aper Series  24364  (Cambridge, Mass.:  National Bureau of Economic Research,  March), https://www.nber.org/papers/w24364 ."

" In fact, the treatment of research and development investment in current GDP methodology originated as a satellite account.18 Another example comes from the BLS and, specifically , how the agency tracks market rents as part of its inflation data series, an issue I mentioned earlier."
" While the official statistics on housing services inflation do not break out new tenant market rents  16 See Kathryn Bonney, Cory Breaux, Cathy Buffington, Emin Dinlersoz, Lucia S."
" Data users are still learning how to best combine the signal from the NTRI with other measures of market rents, but this research effort shows the agility of the statistical agencie s in responding to current needs of understanding inflation dynamics."
" My colleagues on the FOMC and I make determinations on the policy actions that will be most appropriate for achieving our dual mandate, and so I would like to briefly share my views on how I see the economy evolving and how I see appropriate monetary policy."
"Despite a few bumps at the beginning of the year, inflation has continued to trend down in all price categories."
 But inflation remains above our target.
 I do believe that supply and demand are gradually coming into better balance.
" Supplyside bottlenecks continue to heal, and demand has moderated amid high interest rates and as households’ excess savings have depleted."
 The labor market likewise has seen substantial rebalancing  - 15 - and nominal wage growth moderating as a result —even while keeping up with inflation.
" Job vacancies and the quit s rate have come down from their historically high levels from a couple years ago, and the vacancyto-unemployment ratio is now back at its pre -pandemic level."
 This continued rebalancing suggests that inflation will continue to move down toward our 2 percent target.
" As I have discussed in recent remarks, if economic conditions continue to evolve in this favorable manner  with more rapid dis inflation , as evidenced  in the inflation data of the past three months , and employment softening but remaining resilient as seen in the past few jobs reports , I anticipate that it will be appropriate to begin easing monetary policy later this year."
" But my approach to this policy decision will continue to be data dependent and to rely on multiple and diverse sources of data to form my view of how the economy is evolving, especially as upside risks to inflation and downside risks to employment have become much more balanced ."
" If the labor market cools too much and unemployment continues to increase and is driven by layoffs, I would see it as appropriate to cut rates sooner rather than later."
" Alternatively , if incoming data do not provide confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent, it may be appropriate t o hold rates steady for a little longer."
