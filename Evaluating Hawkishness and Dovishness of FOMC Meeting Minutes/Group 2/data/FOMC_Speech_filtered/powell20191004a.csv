"Powell   Chair   Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at  “Perspectives on Maximum Employment and Price Stability”   a Fed Listens event sponsored by  the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   Washington, D.C.            October 4, 2019   Good afternoon."
" Welcome to the room where members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the 12 Reserve Banks meet eight times a year —most recently , two weeks ago —to decide the stance of monetary policy."
" The Reserve Banks and the Board have been holding Fed Listens events around the country as part of a comprehensive and public review of our monetary policy strategy, tools, and communications practices."
"   We’ve invited you here because we want to better understan d how monetary policy affects the lives of the people your organizations represent —union members, small  business owners, residents of low - and moderate -income communities, retirees, and others."
 W e want to hear your perspective on maximum employment and pr ice stability —the monetary policy goals Congress has assigned us .
" Unemployment is near a half -century low, and inflation is running close to, but a bit below, our 2 percent objective."
" While we believe our strategy and tools have been and remain effective, the U.S. economy, like other advanced economies around the world, is facing some longer -term challenges —from low growth, low inflation, and low interest rates."
" While slow growth is obviously not good, you may be asking, “What’s wrong with low inflation and low interest rates?”  Low can be good, but when inflation—and, consequently, interest rates— are too low, the Fed and other central banks have less room to cut rates to support the economy during downturns."
" So, in this review, we are examining strategies that might better allow  us to symmetrically and sustainably achieve 2 percent inflation."
" Doing so would help prevent inflation expectations among consumers, businesses, and investors from slipping too low, as they appear to have done in several advanced economies."
" Morefirmly anchored expectations, in a virtuous circle, would help keep actual inflation around our target, thus  - 3 - preserving our ability to change interest rates as appropriate to meet our mandate."
 We are also looking at whether our existing monetary policy tools  will be adequate when the next downturn comes.
 One clear takeaway of the sessions so far is the importance of sustaining our historically strong job market.
