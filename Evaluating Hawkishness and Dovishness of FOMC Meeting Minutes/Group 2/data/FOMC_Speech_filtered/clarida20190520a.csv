"For release on delivery  1:05 p.m. EDT  May 20, 2019         The Federal Reserve’s Review of Its Monetary Policy  Strategy , Tools, and Communication Practices     Remarks by  Richard H."
"Clarida   Vice Chair   Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at  “Fed Listens :  A Capstone Roundtable ” hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of  New York   New York, New York         May 20, 2019   I am pleased to attend this Fed Listens event providing the New York  perspective for the Federal Reserve’s review  of our monetary policy strateg y, tools, and communication practices .1  We are bringing open minds  to our review  and are seeking  a broad range of perspectives."
"  To us, it simply seems like good institutional practice to engage with a wide range of interest ed individuals and groups as part of a comprehensive approach to enhanced transparency and accountability.2 Motivation for the Review  The Congress charged t he Federal Reserve with achieving a dual mandate —maximum employment and price stability—and this review will take this mandate as given."
 We will also take as given that a 2 percent rate of inflation in the price index for personal consumption expenditures is the operational goal  most consistent with our price -stability mandate.
"With the U.S. economy operating at or close to our maximum -employment and price -stability  goals , now is an especially opportune time for  this review."
" The unemployment rate is at  a 50year low, and inflation is running close to our 2 percent objective."
 2 Fuhrer and others (2018) explore the desirability of comprehensive reviews of the monetary policy framework.
"Perhaps most importantly , neutral  interest  rates appear to have fallen in the United States and abroad.3  This global decline in neutral rates is widely expected to persist for years and likely reflects several factors, including aging populat ions, changes in risk -taking behavior, and a slowdown in technology growth."
" That development, in turn, could make it more difficult during downturns for  monetary policy to support  household spending, business investment, and employment and keep inflation from falling too low .4 Another key development in recent decades is that inflation appears less responsive to resource slack , implying a change in the dynamic relationship between inflation and employment.5  This change is, in a sense, a proverbial double -edged sword."
" It permits the Federal Reserve to support employment more aggressively during downturns —as was the case during and after the Great Recession —because a sustained inflation breakout is less likely when inflation is less responsive to employment                                                  3 For evidence of a fall in neutral rates of interest in the United States and abroad, see, among several contributions, King and Low (2014) ; Holston, Laubach, and Williams (2017) ; Rachel and Smith (201 7); and Brand, Bielecki, and Penalver (2018)."
" 4 For ass essments of the risks that U.S. monetary policy will be constrained by the effective lower bound and its implications for economic activity and inflation, see Kiley and Roberts (2017), Erceg and others (2018), Swanson  (2018), and Chung and others (2019)."
 5 The apparent diminished responsiveness of inflation to resource slack is known in economic research as a flattening of the short -run Phillips curve.
" - 3 - conditions .6  However, that dynamic  also increases the cost, in terms of economic output, of reversing unwelcome increases in longer -run inflation expectations ."
" Thus, it is all the more  important that longerrun inflation expectations remain anchored at levels consistent with our  2 percent inflation objective .7 Finally, the strengthening of the labor market in recent years has highlighted the challenges of assessing the proximity  of the labor market to the full employment leg of the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate."
" The unemployment rate, which stood at 3.6 percent in April,  has been interpreted by many observers as suggesting that the labor market is currently operating beyond ful l employment."
" However, the level of the unemployment rate that is consistent with full employment is not directly observable and thus must be estimated."
" For example, in the March  Blue Chip economic outlook survey, the average estimate of the natural rate of unemployment for the bottom 10                                                  6 One potential contributor to the flattening of the Phillips curve is a change in the conduct of monetary policy since  the 1980s toward greater stabilization of inflation and economic activity; for evidence of such a change, see Clarida, Galí, and Gertler (2000);  Boivin and Giannoni (2006) ; and Boivin, Kiley, and Mishkin (2010 )."
" Similarly, the adoption of an explicit inflation objective, along with greater certainty regarding the conduct of monetary policy, can help anchor longer -term inflation expectations and stabilize actual inflation in response to shocks."
 7 See Yellen (2015) for a discussion of inflation dynamics and monetary policy ; see Erceg and others (2018) for a quantitative exploration of the monetary policy implications of a flat Phillips curve in an uncertain economic environment.
" Since the mid1980s, movements in both realized inflation and measures of longer -term inflation expectations have been somewhat muted, complicating the task of extracting the precise role of inflation expectations as a determinant of realized inflation."
 Faust and Wright (2013) review the literature on inflation forecasting and present evidence in support of the conclusion that measures of inflation e xpectations help predict the trend in inflation.
" Cecchetti and others (2017) showed that while the level of realized inflation and four -quarter -ahead inflation expectations are positively correlated, changes in these variables have been largely uncorrelat ed since the mid -1980s."
" These authors suggest that, in a low and stable inflation environment, policymakers should pay attention to a wide array of other indicators in determining the implications of movements in realized inflation and measures of inflati on expectations."
"  - 4 - respondents was 3.9 percent, as compared with 4.7 percent for the highest 10 respondents.8 The decline in the  unemployment rate in recent years has been accompanied by a pronounced increase in labor force participation for individuals in their prime working years.9  These increases in participation have provided employers with a significant source of additional l abor input and may be one factor restraining inflationary pressures."
" As with the unemployment rate, whether participation will continue to increase in a tight labor market remains uncertain."
" For example, African Americans and Hispanics have experienced persistently higher unemployment rates than whites for many decades.10  However, those unemployment rate gaps have narrowed as the labor market has strengthened, and there is some indication of an extra benefit to these groups as the unemployment rate moves into very low territory.11  Likewise, although unemployment rates for less -educated workers are persistently higher tha n they are for their more -educated counterparts, the se gap s appear to narrow as the labor market                                                  8 The average estimate from the Blue Chip respondents was 4.3 percent."

"  - 5 - strengthens.12  And wage increases in the past couple of years have been strongest for lesseducated workers and for those at the lower end of the wage distribu tion.13 Activities and Timeline for the Review  Our monetary policy review  will have several components.14  The Board and the Reserve Banks are hosting  Fed Listens events —such as this one in New York —in which we are hearing  from , among others, business and labor leaders, community development advocates , and academics."
"Building on the perspectives we hear and on staff analysis, the F ederal Open Market Committee  will perform  its own assessment of how it conducts  monetary policy, beginning around the middle of t he year."
" The box “Employment Disparities between Ru ral and Urban Areas” in the Board’s February  2019  Monetary Policy Report  examines these disparities in more detail; see Board of Governors (2019 , pp."
 What I can say is that any changes to our conduct of monetary policy that we might make will be aimed solely at improving our ability to achieve and sustain our dual -mandate objectives in the world we live in today.
