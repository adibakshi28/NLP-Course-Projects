" Today, I will focus my discussion on monetary policy, bank regulatory reforms, the evolving standards in bank supervision, and new developments in the payments system."
" Before discussi ng bank regulation and supervision, I ’d like to offer my thoughts on the economy and monetary policy."
 Inflation data over the past six months indicate that the C ommittee’s  past policy actions are having the intended effect of bringing demand and supply into better balance.
 This continued progress on lowering inflation reflects a restrictive policy stance with the most recent 12 -month total and core personal consu mption expenditures inflation readings through November at 2.6 and 3.2 percent respectively.
" Employment data, though often significantly revised, continue to show signs of a tight labor market with reports of healthy job gains."
" T he average pace of job gains has slowed over the past year , which  may be a sign that labor market supply and demand are coming into better balance ."
" Considering  this progress, I voted to maintain the policy rate at its current level  while we continue to monitor the incoming data and assess the implications for the inflation and economic outlook."
" And based on this progress, my view has evolved to consider the possibility that the rate of inflation could decline further with the policy rate held at the current level for some time ."
" Should inflation continue to fall closer to our 2 percent goal  over time , it will eventually become appropriate to begin the process of lower ing our policy rate to prevent policy from becoming overly restrict ive."
 And important upside inflation risks remain.
"  To the extent that both food and energy markets remain exposed to geopolitical influences, they present upside risks to inflation."
" There is also the risk that the recent easing in financial conditions encourages a reacceleration of growth, stall ing the progress in lowering inflation, or even causing inflation to reaccelerate ."
" Finally, there is a risk that continued labor market tightness  could lead to persistently high core services inflation ."
" While I do not tend to take too much signal from one report, last Friday’s employment report showed continued strength in job gains and wage growth, and the labor force participation rate  declined."
"   Given these risks, and the general uncertainty regarding the economic outlook, I will continue to watch the data closely —including data revisions, which have increased in magnitude and frequency since the pandemic— as I assess the appropriate path of monetary policy."
  It is important to note that monetary policy is not on a preset course.
" While the current stance of monetary policy appears to be sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to 2 percent over time, I remain willing to raise the federal funds rate further at a future meeting should the incoming data indicate that progress on inflation has stalled or reversed."
 Restoring price stability is essential for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run.
" In addition, many raise d concerns about  the potential adverse consequences of the rules, which include the possibility that these rules will reduce the availability of credit in some underserved markets if banks cut back lending activities due to revisions made to assessment areas defined in the new rules.5  Similarly, the proposed revisions to Regulation II have generated concern from banks directly subject to the rules, but also from exempt banks concerned that the practical effect will be to push  lower interchange fees down to all debit card issuers.6 Of course, supervision also saw significant changes in 2023, with the publication of new guidance on third -party risk management applicable to all financial institutions,  without tailoring or guidance to assist the smallest banks in compliance,7 and climate guidance that on its face applies only to institutions  with more than $100 billion in assets.8  In 2023, many banks also reported very material shifts in bank examination s, with a renewed focus on interest rate risk,  5  See dissenting statement, “Statement on the Community Reinvestment Act Final Rule by Governor Michelle W."
" In the case of SVB, - 8 -  supervisors failed to appreciate, appropriately identify , and mitigate  the known significant , idiosyncratic risks of a business model  that relied on a highly concentrated, uninsured base of depositors , and the buildup of interest rate risk without appropriate risk management."
"   But as every banker in this room knows, concentration risk and interest rate risk are not novel or unique risks, and these good oldfashioned risks can create vulnerabilities fatal to individual institutions if not appropriately anticipated and managed."
" As this audience knows well , all banks are subject to periodic examination s, capital  9  Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, Pub."
