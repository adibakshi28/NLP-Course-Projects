"For release on delivery  10:30 a.m. EDT  September 26, 2017 Why Persistent Employment Disparities  Matter for the Economy ’s Health Remarks by Lael Brainard Member Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System  at “Disparities in the Labor Market: What Are We Missing?” a research conference sponsored by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System Washington, D.C. September 26, 2017  I want to com pliment the organizers and others for gathering an outstanding group of researchers and papers for this conference."
" While opportunity and inclusion have long been central  to American values, it is increasingly clear that they are also central to the strength of our economy.1   As directed by the Congress, the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate is to promote maximum employment and stable prices."
" In fulfilling its dual mandate, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has set a target of 2 percent for inflation but does not have a similarly fixed numerical goal for maximum employment."
" That is because the level o f maximum employment depends on “ nonmonetary factors that affect the structure and dynamics of the labor market,” which “may change over time and may not be directly measurable.”2  Understanding how close the labor market is to our full -employment goal requires consulting a variety of evidence along with a healthy dose of judgment."
 The recognition that maximum employment evolves over time to reflect changes in the economic landscape serves us well  by requiring FOMC participants  to develop a nuanced understanding  of labor market developments.
  This approach to maximum employment has allowed the FOMC to navigate the current expansion in a way that has likely brought more people back into productive employment than might have been th e case with a fixed  unemployment rate target based                                                  1 I am grateful to Christopher Smith  for his assistance in preparing this text.

" This is especially true at a time when the traditional Phillips curve relationship is flatter than in the past, which means  that price inflation is likely to be less informative regarding labor market tightness than it was  previously.3  It therefore seems particularly valuable to look beyond inflation and headline unemployment to assess the strength of the labor market."
"The Federal Reserve is also keenly interested in disparities i n employment, labor force participation, income, and wealth because they  may have implications for the growth capacity of the economy."
" When we  consider appropriate monetary policy, we  need to have a good sense of how fast the economy can grow without fueling excessive price inflation."
" A t a time when the retirement of the babyboom ge neration looks likely  to be some thing of a drag on the growth of the labor force , it is especially important to consider whether relatively low levels of employment and labor force participation for some prime workingage groups represent slack  that, if successfully tapped, could increase the labor force and boost economic activity."
  There is also an important connection between the economy’s potential growth rate and equality of opportunity.
" To the extent that disparities in income and wealth  across race, ethnicity, gender, or geography reflect such disparities in opportunity, families and small businesses from the disadvantaged groups will then under invest in education or business endeavors, and potential growth will fall short of t he levels it might otherwise attain .4   Aside from reducing the longrun productive potential of the economy, persistent ly high levels of i ncome and wealth inequality may also  have implications for the robustness of consumer spending, which accounts for roughly twothirds of aggregate spending in the United S tates."
"  - 4 - the aggregate, as the wealthiest households are likely to save a much larger proportion of any additional income they earn relative to  households in lower income groups that are likely to spend a higher proportion on goods and services.6   Disparities by Race and Ethnicity   When we disaggregate the economywide labor market statistics, we find significant and persistent racial  and ethnic disparities.7  In August, the national unemployment rate of 4.4 percent, which is low by historical standards, masked substantial differences across different demographic groups."
" As shown in figure 1, unemployment rates range d from 3.9  percent for whites to 4 percent for Asians, 5.2 percent for Hispanics, and 7.7 percent for African Americans."
" Labor force participation rates , shown in figure 2,  also differ substantially, although by  less than unemployment rates, with the rate for African Americans lowest at  62.2 percent."
" Even more striking, a significant portion of the gaps in unemployment rate s across racial and ethnic groups cannot be attributed to differences in  their underlying characteristics, such as age and education levels.8    Although the differences in employment rates between racial and ethnic groups are still quite large, they have narrow ed recently, after having widened considerably during the recession, and are near their lowest levels in decades."
" D ifferences i n unemployment rates across racial  and ethnic groups tend to widen sharply during                                                  6 See Bernstein (2013) and Alichi, Kantenga, and Solè (2016) for more on the potential link between income and wealth inequality and consumer spending."
" For example, in the second quarter of 2017, the unemployment rate for black adult men was a little more than 3  percentage points higher than for white adult men."
" Differences in unemployment rates are similarly near historical lows for black women relative to white women, and for Hispanics relative to whites."
" Since racial disparities tend to get smaller throughout the course of an economic expansion, it seems likely that racial differences in unemployment rates will continue to shrink  if the overall unemployment rate falls further.9   More broadly, the persistent disparities in employment outcomes are mirrored in  significant and persistent racial and ethnic differences in families’ income and wealth."
" According to forthcoming findings from the latest SCF and as shown in figure 3, the average income for white families in 2015 was about $123,000 per year, compared with $54,000 for black families and $57,000 for Hispanic families.10  Disparities in wealth , shown in figure 4, are even larger:  Average wealth holdings for white families in 2016 were about $933,000, compared with $191,000 for Hispanic families and $1 38,000 for black families.11  Moreover , these racial and ethnic gaps in average family income and                                                  9 Data on recent estimates of unemployment rates for adult men (20 years and older) by race and ethnicity are available from the Bureau of Labor Statistics."
"  As the economic expansion continues and brings more Americans off the sidelines and into productive employment , it seems likely that the  positive trends in employment and participation rates for historically disadvantaged groups will continue."
" After controlling for sectoral and educational differences, the research suggests that these factors include discrimination as well as differences in access to quality education  and informal social networks that may be an important source of information and support regarding  employment opportunities.12  While the policy tools available to the Federal Reserve are not well suited to addressing the barriers that contribute to persistent disparities in labor market outcomes, understanding these barriers and efforts to address them is vital in assessing maximu m employment as well as potential growth."
"Over the past 30 years, the convergence in income across regions of the country has slowed dramatically.13  Much of the gains in employment, income, and wealth since the end of the recession, and more broadly over the past few decades, have accrued to workers and families in larger cities."
" Since some workers and families may  find it difficult to move, this concentration of economic opportunities in larger cities may have adverse implications for the well -being of these households and, potentially, the growth capacity of the economy as a whole."
" Technological change, globalization, and other shifts in demand and costs are not new to the U.S. economy, but                                                  13 See Ganong and Shoag  (2017) and references therein for more on the decline in income convergence."
" And the  evidence suggests that concentrated economic shocks and the associated  labor market stress also have broader consequences for health and mortality.15    To provide some sense of the magnitudes, on average over the past year the unemployment rate for adults of prime working age (25 to 54) was about 1 percentage point higher in nonmetropolitan areas than in  larger metro areas.16  But there is an even greater gap in labor force engagement, as can be seen in figure 5 ."
-9 -beyond these employment outcomes.
" For example, a growing body of research has identified a steeper decline in the employment and labor force attachment of primeage men in areas of the country 22 Most analysis suggests that at least half of the decline in the aggregate labor force participation rate since 2007 is attributable to the aging of the population, with a significant portion of the decline that is not related to aging attributable to a longer -run decline in participation for younger individuals and prime -age men; for example,  see Aaronson and others (2014) and the Council of Economic Advisors (2014)."
 One possibility is that the unusually long spells of nonemployment associated with  the Great Recession may have eroded job skills and informal employment networks .
" T he fraction of prime -age men receiving disability insuranc e benefits has increased from 1 percent in the late 1970s to 3 percent more recently.26  Recent research also finds that among all primeage men who are not in the labor force, about onethird reported having at least one disability, and nearly one -half reported taking pain medications daily.27  These supplyside explanations may be related to  the drop in labor demand:  the despair related to diminished prospects of a stable and quality job may lead to substance abuse and related health or mortality concerns .28 25 For nationallevel estimates of the labor market effects from cheaper Chinese imports, see Pierce and Schott (2016a) and Acemoglu and others (2016)."
" In addition , employment in nonmetro areas tends to be more concentrated in manufacturing, which is the sector that has experienced the largest decline in employment from automation and globalization.29  Similarly, research suggests that workers in less populous areas have been more likely to be directly affected by increased import competition from China due to the geographical distribution of industries.30  And for many less populous areas, job opportunities are less diverse than in bigger cities, so that when a plant shuts down, there are fewer local alternative job opportunities for unemployed workers , especially with comparable levels of employment security or benefits."
" In 2016, the fraction of the population that had moved within the U nited States in the past year was 11 percent, down from 17 percent or more in the earl y 1980s, with the steepest decline in the fraction of people moving longer distances, across county or state lines.32  The evidence suggests that the declin e in 29 Based on staff analysis of publically available data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis on metropolitan and nonmetropolitan employment by industry."
" The Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking provides a portrait of household finances, employment, housing, and debt; the Survey of Young Workers provides insights into younger adults’ employment experiences soon after entering the labor force; and the Enterprising and Informal Work Activities Survey provides information about income generating activities that are often outside the scope of other employment and income surveys.35   Across the Federal Reserve System , a variety of initiatives are aimed at understanding economic disparities and how to foster moreinclusive growth."
 The Opportunity and Inclusive Growth Institute at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis brings together researchers from a v ariety of fields to analyze barriers to economic opportunity and advancement.
 The Economic Growth and Mobility Project at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia aims to bring together researchers with community stakeholders  to focus on differences in poverty and economic mobility across demographic characteristics .
