"For release on delivery  1:00 p.m. EST  February 22, 2017         The Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy     Remarks by   Jerome H."
 I will then discuss  longer -term challenges for the economy and wrap up with a discussion of monetary policy.
The Current State  of the Economy  The Congress has tasked the Federal Reserve with achieving stable prices and maximum employment-- the dual mandate.
" The FOMC has set a longer -term price stability objective of 2 percent annual inflation, as measured by the PCE (personal consumption expendit ures) price index.1  This is a symmetric objective, meaning that the Committee would be concerned if inflation were running persistently above or below 2 percent."
" Until early last year, inflation was running substantially below our 2 percent objective, la rgely reflecting declines in energy prices during late 2014 and early 2015."
" However, because prices of energy and food commodities are often volatile, a core measure that excludes these components provides a better indication of where overall inflation is  headed ."
" While core inflation has also run consistently below 2 percent in recent years, it has been gradually rising, with the most recent 12 -month reading at 1.7 percent, threetenths higher than a year ago (the black line in figure 1)."
" Market -based measures of inflation compensation have moved well above their lows of mid2016 but remain below pre -crisis levels, and survey measures have stayed relatively well anchored."
" Overall, inflation seems to be on track to reach the 2 percent objective over the next                                                  1 See the FOMC’s Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, available in Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2017), Monetary Policy Report  (Washington:  Board of Governors, February), https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/20170214_mprfullreport.pdf ."
" Although inflation is currently below our objective, core inflation has generally been close to 2 percent over the past 20 years."
 This outcome reflects the success of monetary policy in anchoring inflation expectations.
Many indicato rs show that we have also made significant progress  toward maximum employment.
" Since 2010, payroll employment has increased by almost 16 million jobs, and the unemployment rate has fallen from 10 percent to 4.8 percent --in line with most estimates of the longer -run normal level (or natural rate) of unemployment and with the median estimate by FOMC participants in the December 2016 Summary of Economic Projections (SEP)."
" Accordingly, the red line in the figure indicates that the unemployment rate gap has es sentially been closed.2  A variety of other measures also suggest that we are close to maximum employment."
 Surveys of household sentiment about the availability of jobs and of business sentiment regarding the difficulty  of filling jobs have now reached le vels seen in prior periods of full employment.
" Moreover, although the pace of wage increases is slower than during pre -crisis periods of full employment, wages have been increasing faster than both output per hour (productivity) and inflation, and labor’s  share of income has begun to move up after a long decline."
" All in all, we appear to be close to our employment objective , and are nearing our inflation objective."
" Even so, it is worth  remembering that the current and future states of the economy are always                                                  2 Figure 1 reports the unemployment rate gap using the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates because they extend further back in time than projections from the SEP."
" Take the concept of “maximum employment,” which requires an estimate of both the natural rate of unemployment for those who are in the labor force and the sustainable level of labor force participation.3  The natural rate of unemployment is not directly observed, and the record suggests that it could be materially lower or higher than current estimates.4  There is also uncertainty about the underlying trend level of labor force participation."

" By contrast, other recent work does not find a strong case for a meaningful further  slack.6  The issue has important  implications, since changes in participation can have material effects on the unemployment rate:  Holding the level of employment constant, a 25 basis point change in the participation rate would lead roughly to a corresponding 40 basis point change in the unemployment rate."
 Longer -Run Issues Productivity and growth Our economy is strong and operating near its capacity.
 But we face important challenges when it comes to the longer -term growth rate of the economy.
" Long -term economic growth depends mainly on nonmonetary factors such as population growth and workforce participation, the skills  and aptitudes of our workforce, the tools at their disposal, and the pace of technological advance."
 The main longrun contribution monetary policy can make is to provide a stable macroeconomic and financial environment.
 The level of potential growth does have important implications for monetary policy.
 One of the surprising features of this expansion has been that  2 percent growth in real gross domestic p roduct (GDP) has been enough to create solid  job gains  and unexpectedly large declines in unemployment.
 - 5 - have been overly optimistic about growth but too pessimistic on job creation and the decline in the unemployme nt rate.
"  In 2007, the average expectation for long -run GDP growth from the Blue Chip survey of 50 forecasters was 2.9 percent (figure 3)."
" Other forecasters have also lo wered their estimates over time, including those sampled by the Survey of Professional Forecasters and, yes, FOMC participants.7  Yet, as this figure shows, unemployment has declined faster than expected."
" The implication is that trend productivity and, ultimately, potential growth are lower than expected."
 The decline in estimates of potential growth has been driven largely by unexpectedly weak productivity growth.
" Labor productivity has increased only 1/2 percent per year, on average, since 2011--the worst performance over such a period since World War II (figure 4)."
" As this figure shows, productivity growth moves around significantly over time  and has averaged about 2 percent since 1970."
" One factor behind the decline since the financial crisis is the relatively slow increase in the capital stock per worker, as weak demand and uncertainty about the future have held back business investment."
" But the more important factor has been the marked decline in total factor productivity (TFP), which represents the part of productivity that is not explained by capital increases or increases in the skills of the labor force."
" The decline in TFP growth has been widespread across advanced economies, suggesting that global trends are at play.8 There is no consensus about the future direction of productivity  growth .9  Some  argue that the important  paradigm -changing innovations  are behind us , while others  think that this slowdown is only a passing phase."
 One thing on which all agree is that the future prospects for productivity growth and potential GDP are highly uncertain.
 I hope there is also broad agreement on the need for policies that maximize potential growth and spread prosperity as widely as possible.
 Low interest rates  Another unanticipated feature of this recovery has been the low  level of both short - and longer -term interest rates.

" Much of the decline is due to significantly lower long -term expectations of inflation, as well as reduced term premiums, likely reflecting both lower inflation risk and the fact that, with anchored inflation expectations, nominal bonds have  become an attractive hedge against market risk."
 Regulatory changes have raised demand for safe assets.
 Lower potential growth implies lower returns and therefore lower rates.
 Changes in savings and investment demand owing to demographics and other fact ors have put downward pressure on yields as well.

Monetary Policy  amid Uncertainty   I’d like to turn now  to monetary policy.
" I expect the economy  to continue broadly along its current path, which implies further labor market tightening and inflation edging closer to 2 percent."
" On this path, unemployment would decline modestly below current estimates of the natural rate and remain there for some ti me."
" Before concluding, I would like to turn briefly to a discussion of how policy decisions are made, including the role of simple monetary policy rules."
" Since  the 1990s, central banks have grown ever more communicative about their monetary policy                                                  12 See, for example, Kathryn Holston, Thomas Laubach, and John C."

" A central tenet that underlies this increase in transparency is that monetary policy is more effective when the public understands how the central bank will respond to changing cond itions , and can calibrate expectations accordingly.13  That means that the Committee must have a clearly communicated, systematic way of responding to changes in economic conditions and the outlook."
" The Committee then makes a collective decision, embodied in the postmeeting statement, setting monetary policy to achieve those goals.14  Over time, incoming information and shocks to the economy inevitably alter views of the appropriate path for monetary policy."
" These forecasts tend to converge over time to the Committee’s 2 percent inflation objective and to each individual’s interpretation of maximum employment, because each individual explicitly writes down a path for policy that is intended to achieve those outcomes."
" Accordingly, revisions to the projections tend                                                  13 See Michael Woodford (2001), “Monetary Policy in the Information Economy,” paper presented at “Economic Policy for the Information Economy,” a symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, held in Jackson Hole, Wyo., Aug."

" For example, economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland regularly update on the Bank’s website an analysis of seven different rules and their prescriptions.17 A good way to see the range of possibilities is through a generalized form of a Taylor -type rule (figure 6).18  As you can see, this rule is based on key factors for monetary policy, such as the neutral real rate of interest, or r*, and deviations of inflation and output or unemployment from their longer -run values."
 The rule also calls for an estimate of the output or unemployment rate gap.
" There is particularly high uncertainty about measuring the deviation of output from its potential; our real -time estimates of this gap are often                                                  15 The SEP is not a “consensus” forecast of the Committee, and the interest rate projections in the SEP are each individual participant’s assessment of appropriate monetary policy."

" T o reduce that uncertainty, we often use the unemployment gap rather than the output gap in these rules.19  We also need to pick values for the coefficients a and b, whether they are the values John Taylor posited in his seminal 1993 article or other values from the vast literature that has come since.20 There are still other choices to make."
 Traditional policy rules are backward looking in the sense that they use available data about inflation and output.
" But monetary policy needs to be forward looking, as I discussed, and there are rules that rely on forecasts of inflation and output."
" Finally, many have advanced the view that, when times are particularly uncertain, monetary policy should react cautiously to incoming information.21  That insight leads to rules that incorporate inertia, thereby slowing down the movement of rates over time."
"                                                  19 In general, the unemployment rate is more informative of the state of the business cycle than GDP because of the difficulties in estimating potential output."
" In discussing the effects of uncertainty on monetary policy, Blinder (1998, p."
" Others have suggested that inertia may be a feature of making decisions by committee; see Clare Lombarde lli, James Proudman, and James Talbot (2005) , “Committees versus Individuals:  An Experimental Analysis of Monetary Policy Decision Making,” International Journal of Central Banking, vol."
" - 12 - Figure 7 shows the prescriptions of three simple polic y rules since 2000.22  While the rules often diverged, all of them called for a substantial reduction in the federal funds rate around the time of the financial crisis, and all of them prescribed easing well below the effective lower bound (ELB).23  Faced wi th the impossibility of providing more accommodation at the ELB through deeply negative policy rates, the Committee turned instead to two unconventional monetary policy tools --large -scale securities purchases and forward guidance."
" If we replace that intercept with the median of the longer -run r* from  the December  2016 SEP, which is 1 percent  (the blue dashed line) , we see that the rule prescribes policy interest rates lower than the unadjusted rule."
" However, many observers believe that the neutral real interest rate is currently well below its longer -run value."
" The language that has appeared in the Committee ’s postmeeting statement since December 2015 that “ the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer                                                  22 These are static simulations and do not incorporate feedback from the policy rule to real activity or inflation."

24 Figure 2 of the SEP provides eac h individual FOMC participant’s assessment of “appropriate monetary policy” in the form of a dot plot.
 “Appropriate monetary policy” is defined as the future path of policy that each participant deems most likely to foster outcomes for economic activity and inflation that best satisfy his or her individual interpretation of the Federal Reserve’s objectives of maximum employment and price stability.
" The policy prescriptions are derived using the median projections for core PCE price inflation, the unemployment rate, and the longer -run normal unemployment rate from the December  2016 SEP."
" The first -difference rule shown by the purple dashed -dotted line incorporates forecasts by prescribing changes to the federal funds rate based on proje cted inflation relative to its objective and the projected change in the output gap.26  The insight behind this rule is that it does not require estimates of the neutral real rate or the level of the output gap.27  The green dashed line shows the policy prescription from an inertial version of the “balanced approach” rule with an intercept of 1 percent, which includes a lagged value of the nominal interest rate.28  This rule does not go as far as the first -difference rule in eliminating the level of r* from th e policy prescription, but it does prescribe that policy move only slowly toward its longer -run level, which places less weight in the short -run on the estimate of r*."
"26 Orphanides (2003) proposed a rule that sets changes in the nominal interest rate equal to deviations in nominal income growth relative to target, ΔR = β [ (π + Δ y)  ̶  ( π* + Δy*)  ], where y is real GDP."
" The forecast -based version employed her e substitutes the change in the unemployment gap for the change in the output gap (using an Okun’s law coefficient of 2) and sets β to 0.5, yielding ΔR = 0.5 (π   ̶  π* )  ̶  Δ u."
" When implemented using forecasts, inflation is the 4 -quarter inflation rate 3  quarters ahead, and Δu is the 4 -quarter change in the unemployment rate 3 quarters ahead."

" One such consideration of great importance is that, with the secular decline in interest rates over the past 35 years, policy is now far more likely to hit the ELB than had been thought, which may present severe challenges."
 But monetary policy may sometimes face tradeoffs between macroeconomic objectives and financial stability.
