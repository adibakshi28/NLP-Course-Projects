 Further targeted fiscal support will be needed alongside accommodative monetary policy to turn this K -shaped recovery into a broad -based and inclusive recovery.
" Targeted interventions, along with adaptations  in the behavior of households and businesses, have enabled economic activity to recover."
" But within the overall improvement, some groups and sectors continue to see depressed employment, income, and revenues."
 The pace of labor market improvement is decelerating at a time when employment is still far short of its maximum  level .
" As of September, t otal nonfarm payroll employment ha d recovered about half of the jobs  that were  lost in March and April, and it remain ed about 11 million jobs below its February level."
" Similarly, a fter seeing large declines during much of the summer, initial claims for unemployment insurance have crept up recently and remain elevated."
 The 1/2 percentage point decline in the unemployment rate in September to 7.9 percent was accompanied by a 0.3  percentage point decline in the labor force participation rate (LFPR ).4  The recent decline in primeage labor force participation has been due primarily to women.
" Indeed, the fraction of prime -age respondents to the Current                                                  4 The reported unemployment rates  used here also reflect misclassification, although this is declining."
 The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) has indicated that the official unemployment rate has understated the extent of joblessness in recent months because many workers who were on temporary layoff were incorrectly reported as being employed but absent from work.
" The BLS estim ated that this misclassification held down the unemployment rate by abo ut 5 percentage points in April, declining to about 0.4 percentage point in September."
"  - 5 - Population Survey in September with children age s 6 to 17 who reported being out of the labor force for caregiving reasons was about 14 percent, up nearly 2 percentage points from a year earlier .5  If not soon reversed, t he decline  in the participation rate for prime -age women could have longer -term implications for household incomes and potential growth."
" Although employment fell sharply for all groups between February and April, the decline was steeper fo r Black and Hispanic workers than for white and Asian workers, steeper for women than for men, and steeper for noncollege -educated workers than for college graduates."
" At 12.1 percent , the unemployment rate for Black workers  is more than 4 percentage points higher than the aggregate.6  Occupation and industry affiliation can explain only part of the se COVID19 labor market disparities.7   In the years before  the pandemic, I was encouraged to see primeage individuals in all demographic groups drawn into th e strong labor market, reversing the  previous                                                   5 Staff calculations based on the microdata from the September Current Population Survey."
" 6 After declining by 11.5 percentage points between Feb ruary and April, the employment -topopulation  ratio for Black prime -age individuals has recovered by 4.5 percentage points."

" Over the same period, core PCE price inflation picked up fr om 0.9 percent to 1.6 percent, supported lately by increases in prices of durable goods, including those for used cars and household appliances.9  While inflation may temporarily rise to  or above  2 percent on a 12month basis next year when the March and April price readings fall out of the 12 -month calculation, my baseline forecast for inflation over the medium term is  for it to remain short of 2 percent over the next few  years."

" With unemployment and reduced hours likely to persist, many of these households  are unlikely to be able to sustain recent levels of consumption without additional fiscal support as well as  extended  loan forbearance and eviction  moratorium s."
" The financial security of displac ed workers will depend importantly o n whether unemployment benefits will be extended or supplemented—and if this will occur before any remaining savings accrued from the CARES Act funding run out.11   Analogous questions arise with regard to the many hardhit small businesses that were sustai ned early in the crisis by PPP loans, whose finances are becoming increasingly strained as revenue shortfalls persist."

" Premature withdrawal of fiscal support would risk  allow ing recessionary dynamics to become entrenched, holding back employment  and spending, increasing  scarring  from extended unemployment  spells, leading more businesses to shutter, and ultimately harming productive capacity."
"  The recovery will be broader  based, stronger, and faster if monetary policy and fiscal policy both provide continued support to the economy."
" While monetary policy has helped keep credit available and borrowing costs low, fiscal policy has replaced lost incomes among households experiencing layoffs and businesses and states and localities suffering temporary drops in revenue."
"  Monetary Policy  Finally, l et me turn to how the new Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy will help monetary policy achieve its goals."

" Information about the review of monetary policy s trategy, tools, and communications can also be found on the Board’s website,  at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/revi ewof-monetary -policy -strategy -tools -andcommunications.htm ."
" In addition, see Lael  Brainard (2020) , “Bringing the Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy into Alignment with Longer -Run Changes in the Economy ,” speech delivered at “How t he Fed Will Respond to the COVID -19 Recession in an Era of Low  - 9 - below 2 percent, and the low responsi veness of inflation to resource slack embodied in a flat Phillips curve reduces the amount we can cut rates to buffer the economy, weakens inflation expectations, and could lead to worse employment and inflation outcomes over time."
" Consequently, it is important to strengthen our ability to achieve our employment and inflation goals by committing to a path of policy and lowering borrowing costs along  the yield curve."
  The new statement on goals and strategy makes several key changes that should significant ly improve the way the Committee conducts monetary policy.
 It eliminates the previous reference to a numerical estimate of the longer -run normal unemployment rate and instead defines the statutory maximum level of employment as a broadbased and inclusive  goal.
" It commits that the Committee will aim to eliminate shortfalls of employment from its maximum level, rather than the previous reference to deviations, which could be in either direction."
" By eliminating  the rationale for removing accommodation pree mptively when the unemployment rate nears estimates of the natural  rate in anticipation of high inflation that is unlikely to materialize, the new framework will avoid an unwarranted loss of opportunity for many Americans."
" The broadbased and inclusive de finition of maximum employment calls for a more comprehensive assessment of areas of slack in the labor market, such as the disparities in employment outcomes I discussed earlier."
"   To address the downward bias associated with the proximity of the policy rate to its lower bound, the new statement on goals and strategy adopts a flexible inflation                                                  Rates and Low Inflation,” an event hosted by the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy at the Brookings Institution, Washington, September  1, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/brainard20200901a.htm ."
  - 10 - averaging targeting (FAIT) strategy that seeks to achieve inflation that averages 2  percent over time.
" Under an inflation averaging strategy, appropriate monetary policy will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for a time to compensate for shortfalls during a period when it has been running persistently below 2 percent."
"  The labor market must reach “levels consistent with the Committee’ s assessments of maximum employment.”  In flation would need to rise  to 2 percent, and, in addition, the Committee  would need to assess that inflation is on track to moderately exceed 2 per cent for some time."
" The new FAIT framework is implemented not only through these outcome -based conditions for the liftoff of the policy rate , but also through  the commitment that monetary policy will remain accommodative after liftoff for some time in order to achieve “ inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time,” consistent with longer -term inflation expectations anchored at 2 percent."
 T his implies there likely will be a period after liftoff when the policy rate remains below neutral to support the inflation makeup strategy and maximum employment .

" In addition to carefully monitoring labor market and inflation outcomes , it will be important to monitor a variety of indicators to see evidence that longer -term inflation expectations are moving sustainably to 2 percent."
" Inflation expectations are difficult to measure directly, so I generally consult a set  of indicators to provide a more complete picture than any one measure on its own."
" For instance,  median 5and 10year PCE inflation expectations from the Survey of Professional Forecasters both dropped considerably in the second quarter  and stand at 1.7 percent and 1.85 percent, respectively, for the third quarter, which are the second lowest, and lowest , readings, respectively, in each series."
"  In addition to survey data that are available at a monthly or quarterly frequency, we monitor market -based measures of inflation expectations that are available daily ."
" To use market -based measures of inflation compensation based on Treasury Inflation -Protected Securities (TIPS) or inflatio n swaps, the signal on inflation expectations must be separated from liquidity and term premi ums through model -based methods.14  After                                                  Governors of the Federal Reserve System, February), https://doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2019.009 , in addition to analytical work developed as part o f the framework review:  Jonas Arias, Martin Bodenstein, Hess Chung, Thorsten Drautzburg, and Andrea Raffo (2020) , “Alternative Strategies:  How Do They Work?"

"  Finally, it is useful to consult measures of underlying trend inflation.15  A variety of estimates using timeseries models suggest th at underlying trend inflation may have moved down by as much as 1/2 percentage point over the past decade.16    It is difficult to anticipate how long it will take to achieve the conditions set out in the forward guidance ."
" When it does lift off , the policy rate could  be expected to change only gradually, reflecting the commitment to remain accommodative until inflation has moderately exceeded 2 percent for some time."

" - 13 - recovery will dictate the actual path of monetary policy , as implied by the conditional outcome -based forward guidance adopted in September."
" Indeed, a key benefit of outcome -based forward guidance is that it conveys the Committee’s monetary policy reaction function in a manner that is transparent and responsive to changes in economic  conditions .17   In conjunction with the forward guidance on the policy rate, the commitment to continue asset purchases at  least at  the current pace over coming months is also helping to achieve our goals by keeping borrowing costs low for households  and businesses along the yield curve."
" As noted in the September FOMC minutes, in the months ahead, we will have the opportunity to deliberate and to clarify how the asset purchase program could best work in combination with forward guidance to support ac hievement of maximum employment and 2 percent average inflation."
" By pledging to provide accommodation until shortfalls from maximum employment have been eliminated and average inflation of 2 percent has been achieved, the new forward guidance will ensure that the recovery reaches those who have been disproportionately affected , leading to a broadbased and strong recovery."
