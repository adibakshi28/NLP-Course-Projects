" The unemployment rate, which reached a high of 10 percent in the fall of 2009, has since come down 21/2 pe rcentage points, to 7.5 percent in April."
"  The increase in economic activity and the decline in the unemployment rate are, of course, welcome, but we still have a long way to go to reach what  feels like a healthy economy."
" The gap between actual output and the economy’s pot ential remains quite large, according to estimates from the Congressional Budget O ffice, and the unemployment rate today remains well above levels seen prior to the recession, and well above the level that the Committee thinks can be sustained once a full recovery has been achieved."
 The stepup in growth  in the first quarter  partly reflected a rebound from last year’s drought and Hurricane Sandy.
" Smoothing through these factors,  - 3 -real GDP was about 13/4 percent above its year -earlier level in the first quarter, a modest gain that is about in line with the pace of growth during much of the recovery."
" Recently, we see that overall demand has been strengtheni ng, with both home sales and prices rising markedly in many areas."
" The increase in activity in the housing sector has been driven by histor ically low mortgage rates, growing optimism about future house prices, continued gains in  the job market, and sizable purchases of homes by investors."
"  Elsewhere in the household sector, cons umer spending--about twothirds of overall final demand--has continued growing at  a moderate pace."
"  However, overall wage growth has been  anemic, and many households have not seen their circumstances improve materiall y."
" These currents of globalization and  - 4 -technological change continue on their path, making it more likely that workers who were laid off during the recession woul d be unable to find reemployme nt that is of comparable quality to their previous jobs.1  About twothirds of all job losses in the recession were in middlewage occupations--such as manufact uring, skilled construction, and office administration jobs--but these occupations ha ve accounted for less than onefourth of the job growth during the recovery.2  By contrast, lowerwage oc cupations, such as retail sales, food service, and other lowerpaying se rvice jobs, accounted for only onefifth of job losses during the recession but more than  onehalf of total job gains during the recovery."
" Indicators for capital investment in the months ahead, in cluding new orders for durable capital goods and survey measures of business sentiment, suggest that growth in business spending on new equipment and software is likely to remain modest in the coming quarters."

" - 5 -Turning to the government sector, the le gislated reduction in spending by the federal government is exerting a clear and c ontinuing drag on economic activity."
" These cuts in federal spending are likely to be an im portant influence on the nearterm prospects for economic growth, and I will say more about this issue in a moment."
"  In contrast to the federal government , the budget outlook for state and local government continues to improve, and the drag  on economic activity from this sector’s cutbacks in spending has dimini shed considerably."
"    Reflecting some of these mixed influences , as I already noted, real GDP has been rising at a very modest rate, and the labor ma rket has shown similarly modest gains over the past year, with the unemployment rate coming down about 1/2 percentage point."
" The gain s in payroll employment over this period have been about in line with the decline in the unemployment rate, although, as is typical, the pace of job gains has been somewhat errati c in recent months."
" Initial claims for unemployment in surance have declined since last summer, and the number of job openings appears to be  increasing."
"    Turning to inflation, recent  data show that price pressures have remained subdued."
" Both total and core inflation we re only about 1 percent over the 12 months ending in March, below the FOMC’s longrun obj ective of 2 percent."
" Inflation is being restrained by the continued slack in labor and product mark ets, while stable inflation expectations have offset disinf lationary pressures to some ex tent."
" Moreover, the increase in gasoline prices that we sa w earlier in the year appears to  have fully reversed, and the path of oil futures prices is downwardslopi ng, suggesting that energy prices are likely to hold down headline inflation ra tes in the years ahead."
"  - 7 -More recently, actions by the Administration and the Congress to reduce the budget deficit have led to further tighten ing of federal fiscal policy."
"  As I already mentioned, both the tax legislation signed in to law in January and the sharp spending cuts associated with sequest ration will likely significantly hinder GDP growth this year."
"    The headwinds from the housing sector ha ve eased, and housing market activity is likely to continue to contribut e to GDP growth over the next few years."
  The headwind from the financial sector also has diminished somewhat over the past year and should present less of a restrain t on economic growth than has been the case in the recent past.
" Ri sk spreads embedded in the interest rates paid by many American businesses, although still  above their precrisis  levels, have also moved down substantially over the past year to levels that are modera te, given the state of the broader economy."
" If the economy in Europe were to begin to grow again, it could support global economic growth more broadly."
" In combin ation with low interest rates, the easing of financial stress has allowed some  homeowners to refinance th eir mortgages to lower their monthly payments, and some types of loans, such as those for purchasing a new or used car, have become available to more people."
"  Taken together, the incoming data and my own analysis of recent developments in fiscal policy suggest that the recovery will continue at a moderate pace, and the unemployment rate will fall gradually."
" According to the Summary of Economic Projections that was released by Federa l Reserve Board members and Reserve Bank presidents after the March FOMC meeting, my colleagues and I expected real GDP growth to step up moderately this year, rising roughly 21/2 per cent after having risen 13/4 percent in 2012."
" In the projection, par ticipants also expect ed the unemployment  - 10 -rate to be in the range of 7.3 to 7.5 percent by the end of th e year."
" Looking a bit further ahead, FOMC participants larg ely expected the unemployment  rate to continue receding, but it was expected to remain above its long -run sustainable level for several years."
" Meanwhile, inflation was expected to remain close to or a little below the Committee’s objective of 2 percent, consistent with ongoing slack in the labor a nd product markets and wellanchored inflati on expectations."
"  Monetary Policy Developments In light of this outlook and the risks around the outlook, it has been appropriate for the Federal Reserve to continue to pur sue a highly accommodative monetary policy."
" During the recovery, we have provided additional acco mmodation through two nontraditional policy tools aimed at putting downward pressure on lo ngerterm interest rates even with shortterm rates stuck at zero:  (1) purchases of Treasury securities and mortgage backed securities and (2) communicati on about the future path of the federal funds rate."
  Our most recent policy actions have sought to strengthen the recovery in the face of only slow improvements in labor mark et conditions and subdued inflationary pressures.
" In considering changes to the pace of asset purchases in the future, we take into account judgments about both the efficacy and potential costs of these purc hases, including pote ntial risks to inflation and financial stability, as well as the extent of pr ogress toward our ec onomic objectives."
" Specifically, we said that we  anticipate that an exceptionally low funds rate is likely to be warran ted at least as long as the une mployment rate remains above 61/2 percent, inflation over the period betw een one and two years ah ead is projected to be no more than 1/2 percentage point a bove 2 percent, and longerterm inflation expectations remain well anchored."
 These thresholds are intended to make monetary policy more transparent and predictable to  the public by making more explicit our intention to maintain policy accommodation as long as needed to promote a stronger recovery in the context of price stability.
"  Although it is still too early to assess the full effects of  the most recent policy actions, available research suggests that our pr evious asset purchases have eased financial conditions and provided meaningful support to the economic recovery.5   Given its statutory mandate, the FOMC ’s policy actions and communications have naturally sought to lowe r interest rates as  a means of strengthening aggregate demand, promoting the pace of recovery in th e labor market, and keeping inflation from                                                  5 For a discussion and list of references regarding th e effects of recent monetary policy actions, see Ben S."
" We will continue to calibrate monetary policy--incl uding both the ongoing pace of asset purchases and communications about the likely path of the federal funds rate--in light of our interpretations of the latest data and the implications of those interpretations for the outlook for economic activity, labor ma rket conditions, and inflation."
"  In light of these factors, most me mbers of the FOMC project a modest improvement in the pace of the recovery this year and next, and, accordingly, a modest decline in the unemployment rate."
 The Federal Reserve will continue to conduct monetary policy so as to promote a stronger economic recovery in the context of price stability.
