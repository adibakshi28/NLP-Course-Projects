"For release on delivery  1:35 p.m. EDT (12:35 p.m. CDT)  October 10, 2022         Restoring Price Stability in an Uncertain Economic Environment     Remarks by   Lael Brainard   Vice Chair   Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at  “Shocks and Aftershocks: Finding Balance in an Unstable World”  64th National Association for Business Economics  Annual Meeting   Chicago, Illinois         October  10, 2022   It is a pleasure to join this discussion today.1  Inflation is high in the United States and around the world reflecting the lingering imbalance between robust demand and constrained supply caused by the pandemic and Russia’s war against Ukraine."
" Global supply chains have eased significantly, but by some measures they are still more constrained than at nearly any time since the late 1990s.2  High inflation places a burden on all Americans, but especially low erincome families , who spend three -fourths  of their income on necessities —more than twice the share spent by higher -income families ."
" The Federal Reserve has tightened policy strongly to bring inflation down, and U.S. tightening  is being amplified  by concurrent foreign  tightening."
" We are starting to see the effects in some areas , but it will take some time for the cumulative  tightening to transmit throughout  the economy and to bring inflation down."
" Higher interest rates  are worki ng to temper demand and bring it into better alignment with supply, which is still constrained ."
" As a result of the significant increase in interest rates  and associated  tightening in broader financial conditions,  I now expect that the second -half rebound will be limited , and that real GDP growth will be essentially flat this year.3   The moderation in demand due to monetary policy  tightening  is only partly realized so far ."
 The moderati on in demand should be reinforced by the concurrent rapid global tightening of monetary policy.
" Against the backdrop of slower output  growth , we are seeing some tentative signs of rebalancing  in the labor market ."
 Anecdotal reports suggest the availability  and  3 Both the Summary of Economic Projec tions (SEP) a nd private forecasters showed expectations of a bove -trend 2022 growth early this year.
 The March SEP showed a median projection of 2.8 percent GDP growth in 2022 and a policy rate path that almost reached 2 percent by year -end.
" In the March 2022 Blue Chip Economic Indicators, the consensus projection for Q4/Q4 real GDP growth in 2022 was 2.6 percent, and policy expectations for year -end 2022 in the Blue Chip Financial Forecast for the same month were  1.3 percent."
"  On a Q4 -overQ4 basis, the S eptember Blue Chip consensus for 2022 real GDP growth was a decline of 0.1 percent."
 The median expectations for real GDP growth on a Q4 -overQ4 basis in the September SEP were  0.2 percent.
"  - 3 - retention of workers  are improving.4  For the second month in a row, growth in monthly payroll employment stepped down, slowing from 315,0000 in August to 263,000  in September."
" The ratio of job openings to job seekers declined to  1.7; for purposes of comparison, this  ratio was 1.2 prior to the pandemic .5  The sharp fall  in vacancies at a time when initial claims held steady at low levels  provides support for the possibility that businesses that faced  significant challenges finding and retaining qualified workers following  the pandemic may be more inclined than in past cycles to retain rather than lay off their workers as demand weakens."
" In particular, there is still a sizable  1.2 million shortfall in employment levels relative to pre -pandemic levels i n the in -person services sectors that acco unted for the majority of September  payroll  gains, suggesting businesses in th ose sectors may still be trying to narrow th at gap.6    That said,  a variety of indicators suggest labor demand remains strong , while labor supply remains below pre -pandemic conditions ."
" The unemployment rate is now  at the very low level that prevailed pr epandemic, and t he volume of quits remain s  4 For example, the discussion in the September Beige Book notes th at “overall la bor market conditions rema ined tight, although nearly a ll Districts highlighted some improvement in la bor a vaila bility, particularly among manufacturing, construction, and financial services contacts."
" 6 The total shortfall in the level of employment  in September 2022 relative to the level in February 2020 from the retail trade, educational services, local government education, health  care and social assistance , a nd leisure a nd hospitality sectors wa s 1.16  million."
  - 4 - elevated.7  This supply –demand  imbalance in the labor market is reflected in strong wage growth.
 The employment cost index increased by a n annual rate of 6.
" A more -timely data source, average hourly earnings , decelerated slightly to a 4.4 percent annual rate over the third quarter , down from 4.6 percent annual growth in the second quarter ."
" Althou gh it is  well above levels consistent with 2 percent inflation, wage growth has been running below current inflation."
 Strong  wage growth a long with high rental and housing costs mean  that inflation from core services is expected to ease only slowly  from currently elevated levels .
" In contrast, core goods have been expected to return to something closer to the prepandemic trend  of modest disinflation as a result of d emand rotation away from goods to services , coupled with the healing of supply chains and de clining core import prices ."
 Disinflation in core goods  would help to offset the inflationary pressures in services.
" During the five  years before  the crisis, core goods  made a small negative contribution to inflation ."
" The contribution of core goods to inflation swung sharply into positive territory in 2021, and had started to step down somewhat in the middle part  of 2022.8  So the surprise in the August inflation data was the large contribution of core goods inflation to overall inflation at a point in the post -pandemic recovery when many forecasts anticipated this contribution would continue moderating ."
" 7 As shown by the data from the Fede ral Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s Wage Growth Tra cker, through August the 12 -month moving a verage of media n wage growth among job switchers wa s nearly 2  percentage points higher than those who remained in their same role, with 6.9 percent growth for job switch ers as opposed to 5.0 percent growth for those who remained in the same role."
" For more information, see https://www.atlantafed.org/chcs/wagegrowth- tracker ."
" For data going back to 1987, t he contribution of core goods to total PCE inflation on a 12 -month basis reached its peak in February 2022 at 1.8 pe rcent age point s and came in at 1.3 percent age point s in August  2022 ."
" - 5 - Since  the pandemic, significant supply and demand imbalances have coincided with large  increases  in retail trade margins  in several sectors ."
" The return of retail margins to more normal levels could meaningfully help reduce inflationary pressures in some  consumer goods , considering that gross retail margins are about 30 percent of total sales dollars  overall."
" For instance, among general merchandise retailers, where the real inventory -tosales ratio is 20 percent above its pre -pandemic level, retail margins have increased 20 percent since the onset of the pandemic, roughly double the 9 percent increase in averag e hourly earnings by employees in that sector.9  In the auto sector, where the real inventoryto -sales ratio is 20 percent below its pre -pandemic level , the retail margin for motor vehicles sold at dealerships has increased by more than 180 percent  since February 2020, 10 times  the rise in average hourly earnings within that sector.10  So there is ample room for margin recompression to help reduce  goods  inflation as demand cools,  supply constraints ease,  and inventories increase."
" Despite the higher prices for a broad set of goods and services , market - and surveybased measures of longer -term inflation expectations are within ranges consistent with expectations that inflation will return to 2 percent  over the medium term .11  Treasury  9 See, for example, Josh Ulick and Suzanne Kapner (2022) “F rom Walmart to Gap, Which Retailers Have the Most Excess Inventory?"
" 11 Although  the Survey of Professional Forecasters saw large increases in expected inflation for 2022 and 2023 between the first - and third -quarter surveys, reflecting the shocks to inflation between the periods in February and August when those surveys were conducte d, the implied 5 -to10-year inflation expectation   - 6 - Inflation -Protected Secu rities –based measures of fiveyear, five -year -forward breakeven inflation compensation are currently at 2.15 percent, roughly 10 basis points below their level at the start of the year."
" The median of inflation expectations  over the next 5 to 10 years  in the Michigan survey ticked down in September to 2.7 percent, below the 2.9 to 3.1 percent range in which it had been fluctuating since July 2021 and back within the range that was common before  the 2015 decline in this metric .12  Currently, t here is a greater dispersion than usual of views  about  future  inflation in survey responses ."
" Previously this reflect ed a rise in expectations for significantly above -target inflation , but now that dispersion also reflects  expectations on the part of one quarter of respondents that prices are likely  be the same or be low their current level 5 to 10 years in the future ."
"  In order  to bring inflation down and to keep  inflation expectations  solidly anchored at 2 percent , the Federal Reserve has increased the federal funds rate target range by 300 basis points in the past seven  months , and both market and policy maker  surveys indicate  additional increases through the end of this  year and into next year ."
 The Board’s broad dollar index has appreciated 11 percent year to date .13   Monetary policy tightening is also proceeding  rapidly abroad.
" The Federal Reserve takes into account the spillovers of higher interest rates, a stronger dollar, and weaker demand from foreign economies into the United States, as  well as in the reverse direction."
" And we are also very aware that  the cross -border effects of  unexpecte d movements in interest rates and exchange rates , as well as worsening external imbalances , in some cases could interact with financial vulnerabilities ."
" It is published in Statistical Release H.10, “ Foreign Exchange Rates, ” available on the Board ’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h10/current/default.htm ."
"14 The central banks of the United States , the United Kingdom, Canada, the e uro area, Australia, New Zea la nd, Norwa y, Sweden, and Switzerland together account for 49  percent of nominal globa l GDP  measured in dollars at market exchange rates ."
"   - 8 - That said, the real yield curve is now in solidly positive territory at all but the very shortest maturities , and  the entire real curve  will soon move  into positive territory  with the additional  tightening and deceleration in inflation that are  expected over coming quarters ."
 Monetary policy will be restrictive for some time to ensure  that inflation moves  back to target  over time .
 It will take time for the cumulative  effect of tighter monetary policy  to work through the economy broadly  and to bring inflation down.
"  In light of elevated global economic and financial uncertainty , moving forward deliberately and in a datadependent manner will enable us to learn how economic activity, employment,  and inflation are adjusting to cumulative tightening  in order to inform  our assessment s of the path of the policy rate."
