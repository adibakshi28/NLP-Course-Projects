"  For release on delivery  7:00 p.m. EST  March 6, 2018         Navigating Monetary  Policy as Headwinds Shift to Tailwinds     Remarks by  Lael Brainard   Member   Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at the  Money Marketeers of New York University   New York, New York         March 6, 2018   I appreciate the invitation from the Money Marketeers to discuss the path ahead for our economy and monetary policy.1 Many of t he forces that acted as headwinds to U .S."
growth and weighed on policy in previous years  are generating tailwinds  currently .
" Today many economies around the world are experiencing synchronized growth, in contrast to the 2015–16 period when important for eign economies experienced adverse shocks  and anemic demand ."
" The International M onetary F und revised up its outlook for the world economy in January, continuing a recent pattern of upward revisions, in contrast to a string of  downward revisions in 2015 and 2016.2  Stronger economies abroad should increase demand for America’s exports and boost  the foreign earnings of U .S."
 The upward revisions to the foreign economic  outlook are also pulling forward expect ations of  monetary policy tightening abroad and contributing to an appreciation of foreign currencies  and increases in U.S. import prices .
"  In recent quarters, the combination of higher oil prices and robust global demand has been  providing strong support to business investment --in contrast  to the sharp pullback from 2015 to 2016."
" This rise follow ed two years of weak  growth, dragged down by declines in the drilling and mining sector ."
 Financial conditions are currently supportive of economic growth despite the recent choppiness in financial markets and some tightening since the beginning of the year.
 The most notable  tailwind  is the shift  in America’s fiscal policy stance  from restraint to substantial stimulus in  an economy close to full employment.
" T oday, from a position near full employment, the economy is poised to absorb $11/2 trillion in personal and corporate  tax cuts and a  $300 billion increase in federal  spending."
 Estimates suggest December’s tax legislation could boost the growth rate  of real gross domestic product ( GDP ) as much as 1/2 percentage point this year and next.5                                                   3 See Board of Governors (2018b).
"    - 3 - On top of that, the recently agreed -to budget deal is likely to raise federal spending by around 0.4 percent of GDP in each of the next two years.6 Achieving Our Inflation Objective  and Sustaining Full Employment  Although the economy is currently around full employment and has been expanding at an above -trend pace, inflation has remained subdued for quite some time."
" Over the past year, overall PCE (personal consumption expenditures) inflation was 1.7 percent , and core PCE inflation was 1.5 percent --not very different from the average level of core inflation over the past five years."
" The persistence of subdued inflation, despite an unemployment rate that has moved below most estimates of its natural rate, suggests some risk that underlying inflation may have softened."
" While transitory factors no doubt played a role in last year’s step -down in core PCE inflation, various empirical analyses conclude  that persistent factors are at play  in the stubbornly low level  of core inflation ."
" According to a  variety of measures, underlying inflation --the slow -moving trend that exerts a pull on wage and price setting--may be running below levels that are consistent with the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC)  2 percent inflation objective .7  For example, some survey measures of longer -run inflation expectations are currently lower  than they were before the financial crisis, as are most estimates based on statistical filters."
" Inflation compensation has moved up recently, but is still running somewhat below levels tha t prevailed before the crisis."
"    - 4 - Thus, it is important for monetary policy to ensure that underlying inflation is re -anchored firmly at 2 percent."
" At the same time, it is important for monetary  policy to sustain full employment."
" If the unemployment rate were to continue to fall in the coming year at the same pace as in the past couple of years, it would reach levels not seen since the late 1960s."
" In one encouraging development, the strong labor market has pulled some discouraged workers back  into the labor force and into productive employment  over the past few years."
" Navigating Monetary Policy  Although last year we faced a disconnect between  the continued strengthening in the labor market and the step -down in inflation, mounting tailwinds  at a time of full employment and above -trend  growth tip the balance of considerations  in my view."
" With greater confidence in achiev ing the inflation target, continued gradual increases  in the federal funds rate  are likely to b e appropriate ."
"     - 5 - Although experience in other countries suggest s it can prove difficult to raise a n underlying inflation trend that has been running below policymakers’  target for several years, stronger tailwinds  may help re -anch or inflation expectations at  the symmetric 2 percent objective."
" Of course , it is conceivable we could see  a mild , temporary overshoot of the inflation target over the medium term ."
" If s uch a  mild , temporary overshoot  were to occur, it would likely be cons istent with the symmetry of the FOMC’s target and  could help nudge underlying inflation back to our target .8  Recent research has highlighted the downside risks to inflation and to longer -run inflation expectations that are posed by the effective lower bou nd on nominal interest rates , and it suggest s the importanc e of ensuring underlying inflation does not slip below target  in today’s new normal .9  We also seek to sustain full employment , and we will  want to  be attentive to imbalances that could jeopardize this goal."
" If the unemployment rate continues to decline on the current trajectory, it could fall to levels that have been rarely seen over the past five decades."
" Historically , such episodes have  tended t o see elevated risks of  imbalances, whether in the form of high inflation in earlier decades or of financial imbalances in recent decades."
"  One of the striking  features of the  current  recovery  has been the absence of  an acceleration  in inflation as the une mployment rate has declined , a development that is  consistent with  a flat Phillips curve .10  Although wage gains have seen some recent improvements, they continue to fall short of the pace seen before the financial crisis.11                                                    8 See Board of Governors  (2018a)."
 The employment cost index rose 2.6  percent last year .
"    - 6 - However, w e do not have extensive  experience with an economy at very low unemployment rates and can not be sure how it might  evolve ."
" While asset valuations appear to be elevated, overall risks t o the financial system remain moderate because household  borrowing is moderate,  risks associated with liquidity and maturity transformation have declined,  and, importantly, the banking system appears to be well capitalized.12  History suggests, however, tha t a booming economy can lead to a relaxation in lending standards , and the  attendant excessive borrowing can complicate the task of monetary policy."
 Conclusion What do these considerations imply for the path of monetary policy ?
" Continued gradual increases in the federal funds rate are likely to remain appropriate  to ensure inflation rises sustainably to our target and to sustain full employment , keeping in mind that interest rate normalization is well under way and balance sheet ru noff is set to reach its steady -state pace later this year .13  Of course , we should be ready to adjust the path of policy in either direction  if developments  turn out differently than expected."
