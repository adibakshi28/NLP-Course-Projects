"For release on delivery  10:00 a.m. EDT (8:00 a.m.  MDT)  August 24, 2018          Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy     Remarks by   Jerome H."
"Powell   Chairman   Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at  “Changing Market Structure and Implications for Monetary Policy,” a symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City   Jackson Hole, Wyoming          August 24, 2018   Thank you for the opportuni ty to speak her e today."
" The unemployment rate has declined steadily for almost nine year s and, at 3.9 percen t, is now n ear a 20year lo w."
 Inflation has moved up and i s now near the Federal Open Marke t Committee’s (FOMC) objective of 2 percent after running generally below that level for six years.
" -2 - that, in time, could demand a different policy response, but today I will step back  from these."
 In keeping with the spirit of this year’s symposium topic --the changing  structure s of the economy --I would also note briefly that the U.S. economy faces a number  of longer -term structural challenges that are mostly beyond the reach of monetary policy.
" E conomic mobility in the United States has declined  and is now lower than in most other advanced economies.2  Addressing the federal bud get deficit, which has long been on an unsustainable path, becomes increasingly important as a larger share of the population retires."
"  Finally, it is difficult to say when or whether the economy will break out of its low -productivity mode of the past decade or more, as it must if incomes are to rise meaningfully over time."
"  My FOMC colleagues and I believe that we can best support progress on these longer -term issues by pursuing the Federal Reserve’s mandate and supporting continued economic growth, a strong labor market, and  inflation  near 2 percent."
  I will focus today  on one of the many facets of uncertainty discussed at the 2003 symposium --uncertainty around the locatio n of important macroeconomic variables such as the natural rate of unemployment.
  A good place to start is with two opposing questions that regularly  arise in discussions of monetary policy both inside and outside the Fed:    2 See Chetty and others (2014) and Chetty and others (2017).
" With the unemployment rate well below estimates of  its longer -term normal  level , why isn’t the FOMC tightening monetary policy more sharply to head off overheating and inflation?"
" With no clear sign of an inflation problem, why is the FOMC  tightening policy at all, at the risk of  choking off job growth and continued expansion?"
" Conventional Views of Macroeconomic Structure  In conventional models of the economy , major economic  quantities such as inflation, unemployment , and the growth rate of gross domestic product  (GDP) fluctuate around value s that are considered “normal ,” or “natural ,” or “desired .”  The FOMC  has chosen a 2  percent inflation objective as one of these desired values."
" In the FOMC’s quarterly Summary of Economic Projections  (SEP),  participants state their individual views on the longer -run  - 4 - normal values for the growth rate of GDP , the unemployment rate, and the federal  funds rate."
"  These fundamental structural features of the economy are also known by more familiar names  such as the “natural rate of unemployment” and  “potential output growth.”  The longer -run federal funds rate mi nus long -run inflation is the “neutral real interest rate.”  At the Fed and elsewhere, analysts talk about these values so often that they have acquired shorthand names."
" For example, u* (pronounced “ u star”) is the natural  rate of unemployment, r* (“ r star”) is the neutral real rate of interest, and π* (“ pi star”) is the inflation objective."
"    For example, the  famous Taylor rule calls for setting the federal funds rate based  on where inflation and unemployment  stand in relation to the stars.4  If inflation is higher than π*, raise the real federal funds rate relative to r *."
" The higher real interest rate will, through various channels, tend to moderate spending by businesses and households, which will reduce upward pressure on prices and wages as the economy cools off."
" In contrast, i f the unemployment rate is above u *, lower the real  federal funds rate relative  to r*, which will stimulate spending and raise employment."
"  4 The original Taylor rule (Taylor, 1993) uses output relative to potential in place of unemployment relative to its natural rate."
" Asset purchases declined to zero over 2014, and in December 2015, the FOMC began the gradual normalization of interest rates that continues to this day."
" Many projections of the natural rate of unemployment fell roughly 1 full percentage point, as did assessments of the neutral  interest rate."
 Estimates of the potential growth rate of GDP slipped about 1/2 percentage point.
" For example , the 1 percentage point fall in the neutral interest rate implies that the federal funds rate was considerably closer to its longer -run normal and, hence, that policy was less accommodative than thought  at the beginning of normalization."
 The 1 percentage point fall in the natural rate of unemployment implies at present that about 1.6 million mor e people would have jobs when unemployment is at its longer -run level.
" For example, as the unemployment rate fell toward, and then below, estimates of its natural rate, many expected inflation to move up."
" When inflation instead moved sideways, a reasonable inference was that the natural rate was lower than previously thought."
" Further, over this period, GDP growth was slower than one  might have expected based on the rapid decline in unemployment and the well -known relationship between output and unemployment known as Okun’s law."
" Put another way, labor productivity growth consistently disappointed, which raised the question of whether   - 6 - that shortfall was temporary --perhaps due to headwinds from the crisis --or was part of a new normal."
 Our approach to this challenge has been shaped by two much discussed historical episodes --the Great Inflation of the 1960s and 1970s and the “new economy” period of the late 1990s.
" Shifting Stars  and the Great Inflation  While the crisis and its aftermath have been extraordinary in many ways , the shifting of the stars is not one of them ."
" Figure 2 illustrates the Congressional Budget Office’ s (CBO)  current estimate of movements in the natural rate of unemployment and potenti al GDP growth from 1960 to 2000 .5  Viewed against  the ups and downs  observed  over these four decades, the recent shifts in longer -run values are not all that dramatic."
" Of course, these CBO estimates benefit from many years of hindsight , whereas monetary policy must be based on assessments made in real time."
  The Great Inflation period vividly illustrates the difficulties this difference raises .
" Around 1965 , the United States entered a period of high and volatile inflation  that ended with  inflation in double  digits in the early 1980s."
" Multiple factors , including monetary policy errors, contributed to the Great Inflation."
 M any researchers  have concluded that a key mistake was that monetary policymakers placed too much emphasis                                                  5  I am us ing the CBO’s estimates to reflect a conventional view over that time span since the SEP longer -run values have only been reported since 2009.
"  - 7 - on imprecise --and, as it turns out, overly optimistic --realtime estimates of the  natural  rate of unemployment.6     Figure 3 compares  the CBO’s  current view of the natural rate of unemployment  in that era with an  estimate by Athanasios Orphanides and John Williams of the rate as policymakers perceived it in real time ."
" The unemployment rate  over this period was  generally well above the real -time natural rate , and contemporary  documents reveal that policymakers were wary of  pushing the unemployment rate even further  above u* (figure 4, top panel).7  With the benefit of hindsight, we now think that, except for a few years in the mid -1970s, the labor market was tight and contribu ting to inflation’s rise (figure 4, lower panel)."
    It is now clear that the FOMC had placed too much emphasis on its imprecise  estimates of u* and too little emphasis on evidence of rising inflation expectations.
" The Great Inflation  did, however, prompt  an “expectations revolution” in macroeconomic thinking , with one overwhelmingly important lesson for monetary policymakers:   Anchoring longer -term inflation expectations is a vital precondition for reaching all other  monetary policy  goals.8 When longer -term inflation expectations  are anchored , unanticipated developments may push inflation up or down, but people expect that inflation will return fairly promptly to the desired value."
" There is no dispute, however, that policymakers did misperceive the natural unemployment rate, and Orphanides and Williams show that misperception of the natural rate of unemploym ent alone would have been sufficient on its own to generate outcomes like the Great Inflation."
  - 8 - adoption of inflation targeting by central banks in the wake of the Great Inflation .
 Anchored expectations give a central bank greater flexibility to stabilize both unemployment and inflation.
" When a central bank a cts to stimulate the economy to bring down unemployment, inflation might push above the bank’s inflation target."
"  With expectations anchored, people  expect  the central bank to pursue policies that bring inflation back down, and longer -term inflation expect ations do not rise."
  Shifting Stars and the  “New Economy” of the Late 1990s  The second half of the 1990s confronted policymakers with a sit uation that was in some ways the flipside of that in the Great Inflation.
" In  mid1996,  the unemployment rate was below the natural rate as perceived in real time, and many FOMC participants and others were forecasting growth above the economy’s potential."
"  Sentiment was building on the FOMC to raise the federal funds rate to head off the risk of rising inflation.9  But Chairman Greenspan had a hunch that the United States was experiencing the wonders of a “new economy”  in which improved productivity growth  would allow faster output growth and lower unemployment , without serious inflation risks."
"  - 9 - late 1998 .10  Starting in 1996,  the economy boomed  and the unemployment  rate fell,  but, contrary to conventional wisdom at the time, inflation fell.11     Once again, shifting stars help explain the performance of inflation, which many  had seen as a puzzle."
" Whereas during the Great Inflation period the real -time natural rate of unemployment had been well below our current -day assessment, in the new -economy period, this relation was reversed (figure 3)."
" With hindsight, we recognize today that higher potential growth could accommodate the very strong growth that actually materialized, let alone the moderate growth policymakers were forecasting.12  The FOMC thus avoided the Great -Inflation -era mistake of overemphasizing  imprecise estimates of the stars."
"  Under Chairman Greenspan’s leadership, the Committee converged on a risk -management strategy  that can be distilled into a simple request:   Let’s wait one more meeting ; if there are cl earer signs of inflation , we will commence tightening.13  Meeting after meeting, the Committee held off on rate increases while                                                  10 In the second half of 19 98, a Russian debt default and other ongoing financial instability in Asia intervened, and the FOMC rapidly lowered the federal funds rate 3/4 percentage point."
" 11 By current data, over the eight quarters starting in 1996:Q3, core PCE (personal consumption  expenditures) inflation fell from 1.8 percent to 1.3 percent."
" 12 During this period, FOMC participants submitted sixquarter forecasts each July as part of the Fed’s semiannual Monetary Policy Report to the Congress."
"  Each July from 1996 through 1998, the FOMC forecast growth very close to or above  the real -time estimates of potential growth."
 The forecast growth is well below current estimates of potential output growth.
  - 10 - believing that signs of rising inflation would soon appear.
" And meeting after meeting, inflation gradually declined."
" In retrospe ct, it may seem odd that it took great fortitude to defend “let’s wait one more meeting,” given that  inflation was low and falling."
" Conventional wisdom at the time, however, still urged policymakers to respond preemptively to inflation risk --even when tha t risk was gleaned mainly from hazy , realtime assessments  of the stars ."
" With the experience in the new -economy period, policymakers were beginning to appreciate that, with inflation expectations much better anchored than before, there was a smaller risk that an inflation uptick under Greenspan’s “wait and see” approach would become a significant problem."
  That approach continues to evolve based on experience and the growing literature on monetary policy and structural uncertainty.
" Experience has revealed two realities about the relati on between inflation and unemployment , and these bear directly on the two questions I started with ."
" In particular, we now know that the level of the unemployment rate relative to our r ealtime estimate of u* will sometimes be a misleading  indicator of the state of the economy or of future inflation."
"  Second, the reverse also seems to be true:  Inflation may no longer be the first or best indicator of a tight labor market and rising pres sures on resource utilization."
" P art of the reason  inflation sends a weaker signal  is undoubtedly the achievement of anchor ed inflation expectations  - 11 - and the related flattening of the P hillips curve .14  Whatever the cause, in the run -up to the past two recessions, d estabilizing excesses appeared mainly in financial ma rkets rather than in inflation ."
" Thus, risk management suggests looking beyond inflation  for signs of excesses."
"  The literature on uncertainty  reviewed at the 2003 symposium --and much refined since  then--provides important advice  for how policy should respond, although not yet, in my view, an explicit recipe or rule that a prudent central bank shoul d follow.15  The lite rature on robust rules, such as  socalled difference rule s, for example, supports the idea of putting less emphasis on the level of unemployment relative to u *.16  The FOMC’s practice of looking at a broad range of indicators when assess ing the state of the labor market  has explicitly been part of the FOMC’s Statement o n Longer -Run Goals an d Monetary P olicy Strategy  since its inception in 2012 .17  We have greatly expanded the scope of our surveillance for signs of labor market tightness an d of destabilizing excesses more generally."
" Indeed, robust rules often reflect tightness through the change in the unemployment rate."
" One general finding  is that no single, simple approach to monetary policy is likely to be appropriate across a broad range of plausible scenarios.19   More concretely, simulations like these inform our risk management by assessing the likelihood that misperception would lead to adverse outcomes, such as inflation falling b elow zero or rising above 5 percent."
" The first case is when attempting to avoid severely adverse  events such as a financial crisis or an extended period w ith interest rates at the effective lower bound.21  In such situations , the famous words “We will do whatever it takes” will likely be more effective than “We will take cautious steps toward doing whatever it takes.”  The second case is when inflation expec tations threaten to become unanchored."
" If expectations were to begin to drift, the reality or expectation of a weak initial response could exacerbate the problem.22  I am confident that the FOMC would resolutely “do whatever it takes” should inflation expe ctations drift materially up or down or should crisis again threaten."
" When following a standard Taylor rule and facing a very flat Phillips curve, for example, it is not always good advice to lower the weight on the gap between unemployment and u* and to raise the weight on inflation in making policy."
  I see the current path of gradually raising interest rates  as the FOMC’s  approach  to taking seriously both of these risks.
" While t he unemployment rate is below the Committee’s estimate of the longer -run natural  rate, estimates of this rate  are quite uncertain."
 The same is true of estimates of the neutral interest rate.
" We are also aware that, over time, inflation has become much less responsive to changes in resource utilization."
"    While inflation has recently moved up near 2 percent, we have seen no clear  sign of an acceleration above 2 percent, and there does not seem to be an elevated risk of overheating."
" As the most recent FOMC statement indicates, if the strong growth in income and jobs continues, further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will likely be appropriate ."
" Inflation is near our 2 percent objective , and most  people who want a job are finding one."
" My colleagues and I are carefully monitoring incoming data, and we are setting policy to do what monetary policy can do to support continued growth, a strong labor market, and inflation near 2  percent."
