 There really is no better place for a central banker to come and talk about the outlook for the U.S. economy and the implications for monetary policy.
"  After a run of great data in the latter half of 2023, it seemed  that significant progress on inflation would continue and that rate cuts were not far off."
" However, the first three months of 2024 threw cold water on that outlook, as data on both inflation and economic activity came in much hotter than anticipated."
" Initially it seemed like the bad data might be simply a “bump” in the road, but as the data continued to point in the wrong direction, the narrative quickly turned towards concerns that the economy was not cooling as needed to keep inflation moving down toward the F ederal Open M arket Committee ’s (FOMC) 2 percent goal ."
 Progress on inflation appeared to have stalled and there were fears that it might even be accelerating.
" Suddenly, the public debate became whether monetary policy was restrictive enough and if  rate hikes should be back on the table."
    But more recent data on the economy indicate that restrictive  monetary policy is helping to cool off aggregate demand and the inflation data for April suggests that  1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.
" C entral bankers should never say never, but th e data suggest s that inflation isn’t accelerating , and I believe that further increases in the policy rate are probably unnecessary."
" That looked  like the kind of moderation that would support progress on inflation, but it was mostly due to two components that tend to be volatile and not reflect fundamental growth—trade in goods and services and additions to inventories."
" Private domestic final purchases —which is often a better signal of the underlying strength of demand in the economy—grew 3.1 percent in the first three months  of this year, almost exactly the pace in the second half of 2023."
 I will be watching closely to see whether this measure  of economic activity in the first quarter continues in the second.
" The Blue Chip consensus of private -sector forecasts projects real GDP growth of 2.1 percent this quarter, with only a slight moderation in personal consumption expenditures (PCE) from the first quarter."
"   Nevertheless, there are several reasons why I do expect some moderation in economic activity ."
" Th is wasn’t surpris ing for manufacturing businesses, since they  have been reporting weakness in employment and inventories for some time."
" ISM results can move around from month to month, but if these numbers are sustained, it would be indicative of slowing economic activity beyond manufacturing."
" One month does not constitute a trend, but this data suggest s that policy is doing its job to moderate aggregate demand , which will support renewed progress in lowering inflation."
" T he labor market is  still relatively  strong and  supporting a solid pace of job creation, but after progress in  bringing demand and supply into better balance in 2023, this rebalancing seemed to stall at the beginning of this year."
"  Then i n the past month or two, the easing of demand, relative to supply seems to have resumed."
"  A big reason for the decline was a sharp drop in the pace of job creation by state and local governments that is unlikely to be repeated, but private sector job creation also fell, another indication that demand for workers continues to slow ."
" That was also the message I take from the unemployment rate in April, which ticked up to 3.9 percent."
" It was the 27th consecutive month that unemployment has been below 4 percent, the longest stretch in de cades, but it stands noticeably higher than the 3.4 percent rate last April."
"  Wage growth is still a bit higher than I believe is needed to be consistent with our 2 percent  target , but it’s not that high and recent average hourly earnings data suggest that wage growth is moderating."
 And some measures of wage growth that  tend to be  forward -looking have also continued to slow on balance.
" Just like the data on economic activity, I see the labor market data supporting renewed progress in lowering inflation, so now let me turn to the outlook for inflation."
Last week’s report on consumer price index (CPI) inflation in April was a welcome relief after three months without progress toward 2 percent .
" That said, the progress was so modest that it did not change my view that I will need to see more  - 5 - evidence of moderating inflation before supporting any easing of monetary policy."
" If I were still a professor and had to assign a grade to this inflation report, it would be a C+ —far from fail ing but not stellar either."
 Headline CPI inflation rose 0.31 percent month over month.
 That barely budged the 12month total CPI inflation reading to 3.4 percent in April from 3.5 percent in March .
" More importantly for the inflation outlook, core CPI inflation, which excludes food and energy prices, came in at 0.29 percent, down from 0.36 percent in March and 12month core CPI fell to 3.6 percent from 3.8 percent."
"  Accounting for price data from the report last week on the producer price index, forecasts are predicting both monthly headline and core inflation based on personal consumption expenditures, the FOMC’s preferred gauge, rose a bit less than CPI last month."
" Although both March and April may round to 0.3 percent, it is good to see monthly inflation falling, even if it requires looking out to the second decimal point."
"Looking across these estimates, t hey suggest  three -month annualized core PCE inflation could decline around 1 percentage point to about 3.4 percent  as the outsized January increase rolls off  the 3 -month average ."
" Like  the CPI inflation numbers, this is not where I want to see inflation."
It leaves me hopeful that  progress toward 2 percent inflation is back on track .
"Before I say more about the implications for policy, this seems like a good moment to make a few points about a bedrock principle of monetary policy—data  - 6 - dependence."
 The appropriate setting of monetary policy requires understanding how the economy is performing and some idea of where we think it is going.
" The economy is dynamic, and sometimes new or revised data can significantly change one’s  understanding of economic conditions and the outlook, which has implications for monetary policy."
I am bringing this up because I hear from some quarters the claim  that the FOMC has become “overl y data dependent .”  This is a phrase that honestly doesn’t make much sense to me but is apparently supposed to mean that we are over -reacting to data and allegedly sending confusing messages about the stance of monetary policy.
" There were significant fluctuations in inflation, which was hot in the first half of last  year and then dramatically coole r in the second half."
" There was the revelation,  - 7 - over time and in different data, that a surge in immigration was augmenting labor supply and allowing a surge in job growth with very little upward pressure on wages and inflation."
" Against this backdrop, the median FOMC participant only gradually reduced their expectation for the unemployment rate at the end of 2024 and  essentially left inflation unchanged."
 Let me now turn to the implications for monetary policy of my outlook for the U.S. economy.
" With the labor market as strong as it is, my focus remains bringing  - 8 - inflation down toward the FOMC’s 2 percent goal."
 The latest CPI data was a reassuring signal that inflation is not accelerating and data on spending and the labor market suggest to me that monetary policy is at an appropriate setting to put downward press ure on inflation.
" While the April inflation data represents progress, the amount of progress was small, reflected in the fact that I needed to report the monthly numbers to two decimal places to show progress ."
" Nevertheless , in the absence of  a significant weakening in the labor market, I need to see several more months of good inflation data before I would be comfortable supporting an easing in the stance of monetary policy."
 What grade do I need to give future inflation reports?
 I will keep that to myself for now but l et’s say that I look forward to the day when I don’t have to go out two or three decimal places in the monthly inflation  data to find the good news.
