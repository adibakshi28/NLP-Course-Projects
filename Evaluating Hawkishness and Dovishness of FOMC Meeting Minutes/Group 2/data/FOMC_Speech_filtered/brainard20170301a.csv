"For release on delivery  6:00 p.m. E ST March 1 , 2017         Transitions in the Outlook and Monetary Policy     Remarks by   Lael Brainard   Member   Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at the  John F."
" We are closing in on f ull employment, inflation is  moving  gradually  toward our target, foreign growth is on more solid footing, and risks to the outlook are as close to balanced as they have been in some time."
" Assuming continue d progres s, it will likely be appropriate soon to remove additional accommodation , continuing  on a gradual path .1 As normalization of  the federal funds rate gets further under  way, monetary policy too i s approach ing a transition, prompting  increased  focus on the balance sheet."
" Progress at Home and  Abroad  Over the past several quarters, we have seen improvement in inflation and activity both at home and abroad following a period w hen the drag on domestic activity from abroad was considerable."
economy and the adjustment of monetary policy to an extent few had anticipated.
 The i mprovement in the global risk outlook was also helped by the continued economic progress and the gradual pace of monetary policy adjustmen t in the United States last year .
"In recent quarters , market participants appear more confident that  China has the will and capacity to maintain its exchange rate regime, while achieving its growth  targets, although there is a tension with  high credit gr owth  that will eventually need to be addressed."
" Early  last year, China’s  gross domestic product  (GDP ) growth, which had averaged nearly  8 percent over the previous  five years, was only a little above an annual rate of  5 percent  in the first quarter,  according to official data, and many ob servers believe that actual  growth was weaker."
" In response, Chinese authorities boosted the supply of credit, ramped up fiscal stimulus , initiated new communications regarding the exchange rate, and clamped down on capital outflows."
 These actions appear to have stabiliz ed growth and calmed fears of  financial instability stemming from a sudde n large devaluation in the renminbi .
 GDP  growth rebounded to an average annual pace of over 7 percent in the final three quarters of the year.
 Monetary policy has continued to provide cruc ial support.
" As  a result, several challenges --including referend ums in the United Kingdom and Italy and liquidity and capital stresse s faced by  German and Italian banks --have so far been navigated without significant damage  to growth, financial stability , or inflation expectations."
" Fiscal policy has ceased being a drag on demand growth and, in some cases , has turned moderately expansionary."
" Overall  euroarea GDP  increased at an an nual rate of 1 -3/4 percent last  year, sufficient ly in excess of potential output growth to bring the unemployment rate down nearly 1 percentage point."
" Fears of disinflation al so appear to have abated :  Measures of inflation compensation based on 5to-10year-ahead inflation swaps, which fell to 1 -1/4 percen t in the middle of last year, have recently moved up to 13/4 percent."
" Activity in Japan has also picked up recently, with GDP increasing 1 -1/2 percent last year --noticeably  above the estimated rate of potential growth --and the unemployment rate declin ing 1/4 percentage point to 3 percent , as m onetary policy has remained supportive."
" China’s  overall debt -GDP ratio is elevat ed for an emerging market economy, especially considering that  Chinese growth is likely to slow noti ceably in coming years."
" In Japan, core consumer price inflation is close to zero--well below the central bank’s 2  - 4 - percent target --and scope for additional monetary policy accommodation is limited, leaving the economy vulnerable to adverse demand shocks."
" In the euro area, growth and inflation may  remain low for some time , which could pose challenges for banks with low capital or high amounts of nonperforming loans and for highly -indebted sovereigns."
" Monthly gains  in payroll emplo yment have maintained  a pace sufficient to continue eroding labor market slack, and wage growth appears to be moving higher on balance."
 We appear to be closing in on full employment.
" The prime -age employmentto-population ratio remains depressed relative to precrisis levels ; the share of employees working part  time who would prefer full -time work remains elevated ; and some measures of wage growth, such as the employment cost index, have increased relatively lit tle in recent years."
"   - 5 - Most recently, we are also seeing welcome signs of  progress on the second leg  of our dual mandate after a protracted period of shortfalls from  the FOMC  target of  2 percent inflation ."
" Recent months  have  seen a step -up in longer -run inflation compensation, which had dropped to worrisomely low levels last year  raising concerns about a softening of inflation expectations to the downside ."
" Both m arket - and s ome survey -based measures of inflation expectations  remain somewhat low , but the re has been some movement in the right direction in the past few months ."
 Inflation has moved up lately as the effect of past increases in the dollar and declines in  energy prices have faded.
 Core PCE inflation --which strips out volatile food a nd energy prices and is a good gauge of future inflation--has also increased .
" Still, core inflation has been below our 2 percent  target for almost all of the  past eight  years, and further progress is necessary to reach  and sustain our symmetric inflation goal."
" Consumption growth has been encouragi ng, supported by continued job gains , rising wealth, and greater confidence."
" Business investment changed  little the past two years, but there are currently signs of renewed growth."
" However, some crosscurrents could weigh on aggregate demand this year."
" The recent increases in longer -term interest rates could restrain housing acti vity as well as other interest -sensitive areas of demand, and some further pickup in the dollar could wei gh on net exports  and business investment."
 Recent months have seen an increase in the  upside risks to domestic demand .
" Increased optimism could lead to faste r growth in consumption and business investment, although the spending data, thus far, do not suggest a noticeable acceleration."
" In addition, t he progress that we have made over the past year , with the economy closer to meeting full employment and inflation objectives, has contributed to the  favorable shift in the balance of risks ."
  The increase in upside risks  to domestic demand and the diminution of foreign risks together suggest that risks to the outlook are more balanced today than they had been for the preceding two years .
"  Nonetheless, the  neutral real rate of interest --or the level of the re al federal funds rate that is consistent with output growing close to its potential rate with full employment and stable inflation --is expected to remain low both in the near term and in the longer run, and inflation is only slowly recovering from a protract ed period of low levels."
" In December 2015, the Committee indicated  that it would continue to reinvest principal payments until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is “ well under  way.”2  The  decision to rely solely  on the federal funds  rate to remove accommodation initially until normalization is well under  way serves an important  purpose , in my view .3  With  asymmetry in the scope  for conventional monetary policy to respond to shocks, there is a benefit  to enabling the federal funds rate to r ise more quickly than would be                                                  2 See, for example, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2017), “Federal Reserve Issues FOMC Statement,” press release, February 1, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20170201a.htm ."
"  3 This is the  rationale in Lael Brainard  (2015), “Normalizing Monetary Policy When the Neutral Interest Rate is Low,” speech delivered at the Stanford Institute for Economic Po licy Research, Stanford, Calif., December 1, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/brainard20151201a.htm ."
" Thus , monetary policy too may be approaching a transition."
"                                                   4 The Bank of England has stated that it is unlikely that it will reduce the size of its balance sheet until the Bank Rate has reached a level of around 2 percent; see Bank of England (2015), Inflation Report  (London:  BOE, November), p."

"   5 In 2006, the Bank of Japan reduced the size of its balance sheet by allowing short -term security holdings to run off and without relying on asset sales; see Kazuo Ueda (2010), “The Bank of Japan’s Experience with Non -Traditional Monetary Policy,” paper presented at “Revisiting Monetary Policy in a Low Inflation Environment ,” a conference held at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, O ctober 16, https://www.bostonfed.org/ -/media/Documents/conference/55/papers/Ueda.pdf ."
" Once federal funds normalization meets the test of being  well under way , trigger ing an end to the current reinvestment policy, t he balance sheet would be set  on autopilot, shrinking in a gradual, predictable way until  a “new normal” has been reached, and then increasing in line with trend increases in the demand for currency thereafter.6  Under this strategy, the balance sheet might  be used as an active tool only if adverse shocks push the economy back to the effective lower bound."
 This strategy  recognizes  that the two policy tools are  broadly  similar in the ways they affect the economy  by indirectly chang ing the level of interest rate s used to finance purchases by households and business es.
" These interest rate changes also have effects on asset prices, and thereby  on household wealth, a s well as  on the exchange value of the dollar and, thereby , on net exports  and core import prices .7  However, relative to balance sheet policies, the  influence of the short -term rate is far better understood and extensively tested :  There have been  several decades and many business cy cles over which to measure and analyze how the federal funds rate affec ts financial markets and real                                                  6 The Committee has indicated that it intends to reduce the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings in a gradual and predictable manner primarily by  ceasing to reinvest repayments of principal on securities held in the System Open Market Account ; see Federal Open Market Committee, Policy Normalization Principles and Plans, in note 2."
" 7 There may be differences in the specific ways changes in short -term rates and the balance sheet transmit to different asset prices and the exchange rate, although estimates are limited and lack precision."
" In contrast, experience using the balance sheet as an active tool has been very  limited and largely confined to a highly unusual period around the  Global Financial Crisis, when short -term interest rates were constra ined by the  zero  lower bound."
" In addition to directly affecting  longer -term interest rates, changes to the balance sheet could serve to reinforce policy communication associated with the short -term rate."
"   Assuming that a subordination strategy is adopted, and the balance sheet is set to shrink passively and predictably once reinvestment  ceases  or is phased out, the re is some uncertainty around the size of the balance sheet when it returns to normal , which the Committee has described as  “no larger than necessary for the efficient and effective implementation of monetary policy."
"  Most obviously , trend growth  in the demand for currency gradually pushes up the size of the balance sheet over time, but there are  also other  reasons to expect the post -crisis  new normal to be larger than pre -crisis levels."
" The structural  demand for reserves may be considerably larger now than prior to the financial crisis  because of a number of changes , including new regulations that favor safe liquid assets and changes in financial institutions’ attitudes toward risk.9  If the  demand curve for reserve  balances  has shifted out, then  a greater supply of reserves will be needed to attain a given interest rate target."
" Moreover , the supply of reserves will need to be set far enough above the structural level of demand to accommodate unexpected shocks to the demand and supply of reserves ."
" Or, the Committee could decide to maintain the current floor system, in which a buffer of reserves, sufficient to accommodate any s izable shocks to reserves  demand  and supply , is maintained, th ereby obviating the need for highfrequency adjustments to the supply of reserves."
" The Committee’ s normalization principles  suggest that  any buffer would be the minimum amount needed to ef ficiently and effectively implement policy.10   Because of changes in structural and short -term factors since the crisis, it is difficult to know with any precision how low reserves can be allowed to drop while still maintaining effective interest rate cont rol."
" At that point, the a mount of reserves will likely be close to the minimum amount necessary to satisfy demand at the target rate.11                                                     10 For a discussion of floor systems and other frameworks for implementing monetary policy, see the November FOMC minutes, available at Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2016), “Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee, November 1 -2, 2016, ” press release, November 23, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20161123a.htm ."
" In the past, the demand for safe short -term assets has sometimes been met by an increased supply of private -sector short -term debt, which  has been associated w ith increased leverage and maturity and liquidity transformation."
"Stein (2016), “The Federal Reserve’s Balance Sheet as a Financial -Stability Tool,” paper presented at “Designing Resilient Monetary Policy Frameworks for the Future,” a symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, held in Jackso n Hole, Wyo., August 2527,  https://www.kansascityfed.org/~/media/files/publicat/sympos/2016/econsymposium -greenwoodhanson-stein -paper.pdf?la=en ; and Ben S."
" With full employment within reach, signs of  progress on our inflation mandate, and a favorable shift in the balance of risks  at home and abroad , it will likely be appropriate for the Committee to continue  gradually removing  monetary accommodation."
 These transitions in the economy and monetary policy are positive reflections of the fact that the economy is  gradually drawing closer to our policy goals.
