"Waller   Member     Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at  The Economic Club  of New York          New York, N ew York           March 27, 2024     Thank you, Barbara , and thank you for t he opportunity to speak to you today.1  My subject , as it often is, is the outlook for the U.S. economy, and how that affects the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) continuing effort to reduce inflation to a sustained level of 2 percent  while maintaining a healthy labor market ."
"  We made a lot of headway toward our inflation goal in 2023, and the labor market moved substantially into better balance , all while holding the unemployment rate below 4 percent  for nearly two years."
" Back in February , I noted that data on fourth  quarter gross domestic product ( GDP ) as well as January data on job growth and inflation  came in hotter than expected ."
" I concluded then that we need ed time  to verify that the progress on inflation we saw in the second  half of 2023 would continue , which  mean t there was no rush to begin cutting interest rates to normalize the stance of monetary policy."
" February job gains moved back up to 275,000, making the three -month average a strong 265,000 , and various inflation measures have continu ed to come in hot."
" C ore personal consumption expenditures ( PCE) inflation jumped to 0.4  percent  on a monthly basis in January , after averaging around 0.1 percent in October through December last year ."
" And with February consumer price index  (CPI) and producer price index inflation data  in hand , some forecasts are predicting  core PCE inflation may be revised up for January and is expected to come in at 0.3 percent  for February , which we will learn about on Friday ."
" Indeed , it tells me that it is prudent to hold this rate at its current  restrictive stance  perhaps for longer than previously thought  to help keep  inflation  on a sustainable trajectory toward 2 percent ."
" Fortunately, the strength of the U.S. economy and resilience of the labor market mean the risk of waiting a little longer to ease policy is small and si gnificantly lower than acting too soon and possibly squandering our progress on inflation."
"  Turning to the performance of the U.S. economy, t he Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow model, based on all current data, predicts first  quarter growth in real GDP  of 2.1 percent  at an annual rate ."
 This would be a significant slowdown fro m the average of around 4 percent in the second half of 2024  but still quite solid growth .
 The data is sending a mixed message on how supply and demand are evolving.
" Recent gains have been broad  based across most sectors , rather than concentrated in a few sectors , which may be a sign that demand is not moderating as much as is needed to support continued progress on inflation ."
" Conversely, the household survey estimated that the unemployment rate rose to 3.9 percent in February ."
" Youth employment tends to be volatile, so this rate  may drop back in the next few months and, if so, pull the overall unemployment rate back down as well ."
"  In reviewing wage pressures , the most recent data suggest nominal  wage growth has continued to  ease."
" And, consider ing overall compensation —wages and benefits  —here, too, growth has slowed but remains a bit elevated."
"  Looking across various indicators of labor demand, there hasn’t been much change in recent months."
" With strong labor supply and little apparent change in demand in recent months, the ratio of vacancies to people looking for work has been roughly flat after declining significantly in 2023."
Let me turn to a topic related to the labor market that has important implications for the longer -term course of U.S. economy :  productivity.
" When productivity across the economy grows quickly, it means that output and income can also grow quickly without putting upward pressure on inflation , so it supports rising living standards."
" And lately, productivity  has been growing fast."
" Some have argued that this must be why we had such strong economic growth in 2023, even while inflation was slowing ."
" Perhaps, they say, we are at the start of another era of fast and sustained productivity growth, such as the United States experience d from 1998 through 2004 ."
 The first thing to note is that productivity growth is notoriously volatile.
" Though productivity grew fast for the final nine months of last year , it actually fell in the first quarter of 2023 and rather substantially for all of 20 22."
 One may view this fast growth as making up for the earlier declines.
"  In fact, smoothing across the past two years, productivity growth averages a bit above 1.25 percent annually."
"  Also keep in mind that periods of fast growth that last more than a few years are unusual, and it is also difficult to be sure about the causes ."
"  When thinking about productivity, one has to distinguish between factors that raise productivity in the short run  but ultimately are one -off increases in t he level of productivity , as opposed to  those that increase the  longrun growth  rate of productivity  so that the level is constantly increasing ."
 So let me posit several factors that have been suggested for explaining the recent increase in productivity and try to place them in the oneoff or long -run buckets.
"  Many people point to recent large investment projects in the United States, such as those associated with the Inflation Reduction Act or artificial intelligence,  as boosting productivity."
" While it is possible  they could  increase longer -run productivity growth, it remains to be seen if they will ."
" Thus, they are  unlikely to explain the recent rise in productivity growth."
" Like the investment projects, it may be causing a boost to productivity,  but it is likely to occur over a number of years."
" And, unless the current - 6 -  boom in new business formation continues into the future, once again this factor will at best raise the level of productivity over the short term and not the long -run growth rate ."
" But once the supply chain issues are resolved, this boost to productivity growth will end , so this clearly is a short -run factor that will simply raise the level  but not the long -run growth rate of productivity."
  Another potential cause of recent productivity growth is that the pandemic changed  how we work and use technology.
" While I certainly can see how this could affect the level of productivity and short -run growth, once we have made those changes, they’re done , so I don’t see this as a driver of sustained productivity growth."
" Again, while I see this raising the level of productivity in the short run , it may simply be returning productivity to previous levels."
 I will be watch ing how productivity evolves  in the near term .
" I will keep my fingers crossed for more good news,  but I am not convinced that the recent boom in productivity growth will continue."
" Therefore, I will keep that in mind as I form m y judgments about the economic outlook and appropriate setting of monetary policy."
 Now let’s talk about inflation.
" We made a lot of headway in reducing inflation in the past year or so, although the readings in the past two months have been disappointing ."
" - 7 -  Both total CPI inflation and core inflation that excludes energy and food rounded to a 0.4 percent increase for the month  of February , which is obviously not progress toward our inflation goa l."
"  In trying to judge what the underlying trend is for inflation, I tend to look at annualized core measures over 3 or 6 months."
 These shorter -term inflation measures are now telling me that progress has slowed and may hav e stalled.
" The FOMC uses personal consumption expenditure inflation data to measure progress toward ou r 2 percent goal, and we won’t get those results for February until Friday ."
" But , as I noted at the start,  based on the consumer and producer prices that we do have, estimates suggest that core PCE inflation is likely to be elevated ."
  Let me pause here and make an important point about how I think about  and want to talk about adverse developments such as this recent inflation data and how  as a policymaker  I manage risks to the economic outlook.
"  It is appropriate to point out that a month or two of data does not necessarily indicate a trend, and there are good reasons to think that progress on inflation will be - 8 -  uneven but likely to continue  down toward 2 percent ."
" At the same time, monetary policy is data driven , and I do want to take it into account when formulating my economic outlook."
" I see economic output and the labor market showing continued strength , while progress in reducing  inflation has slowed ."
" Because of these signs, I see no rush in taking the step of beginning to ease monetary policy."
" The - 9 -  target range for the federal funds rate has been  5¼ to 5½ percent since last July, and I believe that this restrictive level is helping to reduce imbalances in the economy  and continuing to put downward pressure on inflation ."
" While retail sales and some other indicators suggest a softening in demand this quarter from the second half of last year, when growth accelerated , the evidence for a significant slowdown is sparse ."
" Meanwhile , as the labor market continues to add jobs at a rapid pace, some signs point to improvement in the imbalance between supply and demand, but others indicate  continued tightness."
"     My judgment on the balance of risks for monetary policy, which I explained in a speech on February 22, hasn’t changed:  The risk of waiting a little longer to cut rates is significantly lower than acting too soon .2  Cutting the policy rate  too soon and risking a sustained rebound in inflation  is something I want to avoid ."
"As a result , in the absence of an unexpected and material deterioration in the economy, I am going to need to see at least a couple months of better inflation data before I have enough confidence that beginning to cut rates will keep the economy on a path to 2 percent inflation."
" T he remarkable U.S. economy keeps on chugging along, adding jobs at a rate that over time will keep unemployment near its current, historically low rate."
" But the overall strength of the U.S. economy makes it a fairly easy decision to wait a little longer t o get a better understanding of the trajectory of inflation and, when appropriate, begin easing policy."
