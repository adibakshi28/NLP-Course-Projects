" As such, the Treasury market is a key component of the transmission of monetary policy for the Federal Reserve."
" In addition, open market operations in the Treasury cash and repo markets have long been central to how the Fed implements monetary policy."
 The Treasury market also helps us understand investors’ views on the outlook for growth and inflation.
" - 3 - Interest Rate Risk Management  The events in March made it clear how important it is for banks to properly manage their interest rate risk, so I want to spend a few minutes on this topic."
" To start, I would say  that years of very low interest rates  led to complacency at some financial institutions about the degree to which banks needed to manage interest rate risk, including in highquality liquid asset portfolios."
" To manage balance sheet growth, understandably, a number of banks invested in securities, including Treasury securities."
" But investing heavily in fixedrate, long -duration assets without appropriate interest rate risk management led to problems in some cases."
" As described in our Financial Stability Report , as the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) raised the policy rate to combat inflation, yields increased across the curve and some banks experienced sizable declines in the fair value of these assets.3 The higher rate environment also affected the liability side of banks’ balance sheets."
" Unfortunately, a few firms had a combination of both poor interest rate risk management and weak liquidity risk management."
" As I mentioned, as yields on deposit alternatives, such as money funds, increased as our tightening cycle took hold, banks found they needed to start paying higher interest rates to retain deposits and pay up for alternative sources of funding as they lost deposits."
" A recent paper by three members of the Federal Reserve staff discusses how deposit betas rise in a dynamic way as interest rates rise, rath er than having a static relationship to rising rates."

" Fede ral Reserve supervisors have stepped up their supervision of interest rate and liquidity risk, given what we have learned from recent experience, and they will continue to work with banks to ensure their balance sheets are resilient to a variety of conditions.6 The Importance of Contingency Funding Preparedness  That brings me to the importance of contingency funding planning and preparedness."
" Last month, I outlined how the discount window is an important tool of both monetary policy and financial stability.8  It is an important tool of monetary policy because, with the primary credit rate set at the top of the target range, it supports rate control."

" In this way, the facilities can serve to support interest rate control and broader market functioning."
"  - 8 - Staff at the Fed eral Reserve and other agencies have done important work to analyze leverage in the Treasury market using available data.10  These studies have found that hedge funds are significant investors in Treasury cash, derivatives, and repo markets ; that their highly leveraged positions in Treasury markets are facilitated by very low , or even zero,  haircuts on their repo financing ; and that demand for this leverage is highly concentrated among a handful of large hedge funds."
