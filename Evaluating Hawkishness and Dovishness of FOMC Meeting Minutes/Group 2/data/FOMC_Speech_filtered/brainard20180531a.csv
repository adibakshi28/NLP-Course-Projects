"  For release on delivery  1:00 p.m. E DT  May 31, 2018           Sustaining Full Employment and Inflation around Target     Remarks by  Lael Brainard   Member   Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at the  Forecasters Club  of New York   New York, New York         May 31, 2018   I appreciate the opportunity to join the Forecasters Club to discuss the path ahead for our economy and monetary policy.1  In the months a head, I expect to see tightening resource utilization in the U .S."
economy as rising fiscal stimulus reinforces above -trend growth.
" C ontinued gradual increases in the federal funds rate are likely to be consistent with sustaining strong labor market condit ions and inflation around target , with the balance sheet running off gradually and predictably in the background."
" Let me consider each element in turn  Growing above Trend  Although indicators of economic activity were on the soft side earlier in the year, the outlook for the remainder of 2018 remains quite positive, supported by sizable fiscal stimulus as well as still -accommodative financial conditions."
" In particular, the fundamentals for consumer spending are  favorable :  Income gains have been strong, consumer confidence remains solid, and employment prospects remain bright."
" Moreover, the sizable fiscal stimulus that is in train is likely to provide a tailwind to growth in the second half of the year and beyond.2  From a position of full employment , the econom y will likely receive a substantial boost from  $1.5 trillion in personal and corporate tax cuts and a $300 billion increase in federal spending, with estimates suggesting a boost to the growth rate of real GDP of about  3/4 percent this year and next.3   Risks and Uncertainties In short, with a tightening labor market and inflation near target , fiscal stimulus in the pipeline  suggest s some risk to the  upside ."
"Global growth has been synchronized over the past year, but recent  development s pose some risk ."
" With some uptick in political uncertainty, and inflation still below target in the euro area and Japan, monetary policies among the advanced economies look likely to be divergent  for some time."
" So far this year, payroll gains have averaged 200,000 per month, sufficient  to put further downward pressure on unemployment."
" Indeed, t he unemployment rate moved down to 3.9 percent in April following six conse cutive months at 4.1 percent."
" T he unemployment rate for African Americans dropped in April to 6.6 percent, which is the lowest level recorded since this series began in 1972 but still high relative to other groups ."
 April’s 3.9  percent unemployment rate was the lowest reading since December 2000.
" If the unemployment rate falls another couple of tenths --which seems likely , based on recent trends --it will be at its lowest level since 1969."
" Although the late 1960s marked the beginning of what is now call ed the Great Inflation , it is worth keeping in mind that there have been important shifts in the labor market since th at tim e."
" For example, educational  attainment is much higher today than it was in the 1960s, and college degree holders tend to have much lower unemployment rates , on average , than those with a high school degree or less .4                                                    4 The share of the labor force aged 25 or older with a college degree or more is around 40 percent today, compared with 15 percent in the late 1960s, and the share with less than a high school degree has fallen from ar ound 40 percent to around 7 percent today."
" The unemployment rates of college -educated adults are    - 4 - While the unemployment rate is now lower than before the financial crisis , the employment -topopulation ratio for  prime -age workers remains about  1 percentage point below its pre -crisis level."
" The 12 -month change in the employment c ost index  (ECI) for private industry workers in t he first quarter was 2.8 percent, up from 2.3 percent in the year -earlier period."
" By way of comparison, in the period from 2005 to  2007, just before the financial crisis, the ECI rose a bit more than 3 percent at an annual rate, while core personal consum ption expenditures ( PCE) inflation was around 21/4 percent."
"  Sustainably Achieving Our Inflation Objective  Turning to the second leg of our  dual mandate, i n the most recent data, the trailing 12month change in core PCE prices was 1.8 percent , up from a  year earlier, when core PCE prices increased only 1.6 percent."
     - 5 - want to see inflation coming in around target  on a sustained basis after seven years of below -target readings .
" As I have noted before, the persistence of subdued inflation, despite an unemployment rate that has moved below most estimates of its natural rate, suggests some risk that underlying inflation --the slow -moving trend that exerts a pull on wage and price setti ng--may have softened .5  For example, some survey measures of longer -run inflation expectations are currently lower than they were before the financial crisis, as are most estimates based on statistical filters."
 Inflation compensation has moved up recentl y but is still running somewhat below levels that prevailed before the crisis.
  Reanchoring underlying inflation at the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) 2 percent objective is an important goal.
" Recent research has highlighted the downside risks t o inflation and inflation expectations that are posed by the effective lower bound on nominal interest rates, and it underscores  the importance of ensuring underlying inflation does not slip below target in today’s new normal.6  In that regard, if we were to see a mild, temporary overshoot of the inflation target , this c ould we ll be consistent with the symmetry of the FOMC’s target and may help nudge underlying inflation back to target.7   In short, it is reassuring to see core PCE inflation mov ing up, along with market -based measures of inflation compensation retracing earlier declines."
" A fter seven years of below -target  inflation , it will be important to see inflation coming in around target on a sustained basis to be confident  that underlying trend inflation is running at 2 percent ."
"    - 6 - The Yield Curve  Even though  longer -term Treasury yields have mov ed up, on net , since the beginning of the year, t here has been growing attention of late to the possibility of an inversion of the yie ld curve --that is, circumstances in which short -term interest rates exceed long -term interest rates on Treasury securities."
" When the FOMC  is undertaking a deliberate tightening in policy, short -term interest rates  typically  rise, as do expectations of short -term interest rates in the medium  term, while  interest rates in the distant future may  be less affected ."
" For example, if short -term interest rates we re raised to stabilize  temporary swings in the economy, the logic of the expectations hypothesis would suggest that long rates would not rise as  much."
" And if tighter monetary policy were to weaken the economy with a lag, this would lead to long rates not rising by as much or at all ."
"    - 7 - a future macroeconomic risk that could lead to a weaker economy, t his concern w ould tend to lower expected longer -term interest rates, both because monetary policy w ould be expected to be come  more  accommodative in the future and because market participants may increase their relative holdings of  safe assets, such as Treasur y securities."
" In this case, longer -dated Treasury yields may fall, and if short -term interest rates do not adjust commensurately, the yield curve will invert  ahead of a weaker economy ."
  One reason the 10year Treasury yield may be unusually low is that market expectations of interest rates in the longer run may be unusually low.
 A second reason may be  that the term premium --the extra compensation an invest or would demand for investing in a 10year bond rather than rolling over a shorter -dated instrument repeatedly over a 10year period-- has fallen to levels that are very low by historical standards.
" With a very low term premium, a ny given amount of monetary policy tightening will lead to an inversion sooner so that even a modest tightening that might not have led to an inversion in the past c ould do so today."
" The goal of these policies was t o lower longer -term interest rates --and in many cases, expressly by lower ing term premiums."
" A number of studies suggest that these polices have  indeed been successful in lowering term premiums.11   A second  reason the term premium may be lower than in the past is the changing correlation between stock and bond returns , likely caused by changes in expected inflation outcomes.12  While i n the 1970s and 1980s stock and bond returns tended to be  positive ly correl ated, m ore recently  the correlation has tended to be negative."
" With an inverse correlation , bonds recently have been a good hedge for stocks , and  that correlation may have contributed to lower  bond term premium s by increasing the demand  for bonds as an instrument for hedging portfolio risks ."
   - 9 - stock and bond returns in turn may be related to better anchored  inflation expectations  following a long period of low and stable inflation.
" On the other hand, the FOMC ’s demonstrated commitment to maintaining low and stable inflation makes it unlikely  that expectations of high inflation will reemerge."
   It is important to emphasize that the flattening yield curve suggested by the SEP median is associated with a policy path calibrated to sustain full employment and inflation around target.
"Conclusion In an environment of tightening resource utilization and above -trend growth, with sizabl e fiscal stimulus likely to provide a boost to demand in the near -tomedium term that should fade somewhat further out, it seems likely that the neutral rate could rise in the medium term above its longer -run value."
 A  gradual pace is also warranted in light of the long period of undershooting the inflation target.
"  I would not underestimate the challenge of calibrating monetary policy to sustain full employment and re -anchor trend inflation around 2 percent, while adjusting to sizable stim ulus at a time when resource constraints are tightening and the economy is growing above trend."
