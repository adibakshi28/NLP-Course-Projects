"Clarida   Vice Chair   Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at  “The Economy and Monetary Policy,” an event hosted by  the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy at the Brookings Institution   Washington, D.C.  (via webcast)         November 16, 2020   On August 27, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)  unanimously approved a revised Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy that represents a robust evolution of its monetary policy framework.1  The new framework has important implications for the way the FOMC going forward will con duct monetary policy in support of its efforts to achieve its dual -mandate goals in a world of low neutral policy rates and persistent global disinflationary pressures."
" In my remarks today, I would like to look ahead and offer my individual perspective on the consequences of our new framework for the conduct of monetary policy over the business cycle, and I also want to provide some context that connects key el ements of our new framework to the literature on optimal monetary policy subject to an ELB  constraint that binds in economic downturns."
 I will then provide my perspective on how these key elements of the new framework and the related forward guidance connect to the literature on conducting optimal monetary policy at—and after lifting off from —the ELB .
" I w ill next discuss how the Committee’s conception of its maximum -employment mandate , a sixth element of the new framework, has evolved since 2012, what this evolution implies for the conduct of monetary policy, and how I plan to factor in this information  as I think about the appropriate path for setting the federal funds rate once the conditions for liftoff have been met."
" Five of these elements define how the Committee will seek to achieve its price -stability mandate over time, while the sixth pertains to the Committee’s conception of its maximum -employment mandate."
" Of course , the Committee’s price -stability and maximum -employment mandates are g enerally complementary, and, indeed, this complementarity is recognized and respected in the forwardguidance language introduced in the September FOMC statement.3  However, for ease of exposition, I will begin by focusing on the five                                                  3 The September 2020 FOMC statement says:  “ The Committee decid ed to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee ’s assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time” (paragraph 4)."
"  - 3 - elements of the new f ramework that define how the Committee will seek to achieve over time its price -stability mandate, before discussing how maximum employment is defined in the new framework and what this definition implies for the conduct and communication of monetary polic y under the new framework."
"The Committee expects to delay  liftoff from the ELB until PCE  (personal consumption expenditures)  inflation has risen to 2 percent on an annual basis and other complementary conditions, consistent with achieving this goal on a sustained basis and to be discussed later, are met.4 2."
"With inflation having run persistently below 2 percent,  the Committee will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time in the service of having inflation average 2 percent over time and keeping longer -term inflation expectations well anchored at the 2  percent longer -run goal.5 3."
"The Committee expects that ap propriate monetary policy will remain accommodative for some time after the conditions to commence policy normalization have been met.6                                                  4 The Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy articulates the inflation objective:  “The Committee reaffirms its judgment that inflation at the rate of 2 percent, as measured by t he annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, is most consistent over the longer run with the Federal Reserve ’s statutory mandate” (paragraph 4)."
"5 The September 2020 FOMC statement reads:  “ With inflation running persistently below this longer -run goal, the Committee will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer -term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent ” (paragraph 4) ."
 A similar sentence appears in the Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy.
 6 The September 2020 FOMC statement reads:  “ The Committee seeks to achieve maximu m employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run.
" With inflation running persistently below this longer -run goal, the Committee will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 perc ent over time and longer -term inflation expectations remain well anchored at  - 4 - 4."
"Policy will aim over time to return inflation to its longerrun goal, which remains 2  percent , but not below, once the conditions to commence policy normalization have been met.7 5."
"Inflation that averages 2 percent  over time represents an ex  ante aspiration of the FOMC, but not a time -inconsistent ex post commitment.8 I believe that a useful way to summarize the framework defined by these five features is temporary pricelevel targeting (TPLT, at the ELB) that reverts to flexible inflation targeting (once the conditions for liftoff have been reached)."
" In our September FOMC statement, we communicated that, along with other complementary conditions, inflation must have                                                  2 percent."
 The Committee expects to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomes are achieved ” (paragraph 4) .
7 The Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy articulates the inflation objective (see note 4).
"8 The Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy says:  “ In order to anchor longer -term inflation expectations at this level, the Committee seeks to achieve inflatio n that averages 2 percent over time, and therefore judges that, following periods when inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time ” (para graph 4)."
 This condition ref ers to inflation  on an annual basis.
" Second e lement  An alternat ive version of TPLT would commit the central ba nk to delay liftoff until inflation has averaged 2 percent  over a longer period—say , three  years  (Bernanke , Kiley , and Roberts  (2019 ) study the case of TPLT with a three -year memory as well as the case of TPLT with a one -year memory)  or perhaps an even longer period that commences when the policy rate hits the ELB  itself  (as in Bernanke’s (2017a) original TPLT proposal )."
" In these versions of TPLT, inflation w ould likely have to moderately exceed 2  percent  for some time before the condition for liftoff is met."
" For example, if TPLT with a three -year memory were chosen and inflation in three  consecutive years equaled 1.9 percent , 2 percent , and 2.1 percent,  then liftoff would not occur until inflation hit 2.1 percent  for one year."
" Note , however , that TPLT with a longer memory does not define ex ante the amount by which inflation must exceed 2 percent  before liftoff is considered , nor does it specify for how long inflation exceeds 2 percent  before liftoff is considered."
" For example, under TPLT with a threeyear memory, if inflation instead equaled 1.8 percent , 2 percent , and 2.2 percent for three consecutive years, then liftoff ex post could not occur until inflation hit 2.2 percent  for one  year."
" But if , instead, inflation equaled 1.8 percent , 2.1 percent , and 2.1 percent,  then inflation would exceed 2 percent  for two  years before liftoff were contemplated."
" In the case of the Federal Reserve, the FOMC chose a one -year memory  for the inflation threshold  that must be met before  - 6 - liftoff is considered, but it also indicated in September that the Committee expects to delay liftoff until inflation is “on track to moderately exceed 2  percent for some time.”   What “moderately ” and “for some time” mean will depend on the initial conditions at liftoff (just as they do under versions of TPLT with a longer memory)."
" Crucially, the Committee’s judgment on the projected duration and magnitude of the deviation from the 2 percent  infla tion goal will , at the time of liftoff and every three months thereafter, be communicated in the quarterly Summary of Economic Projections ( SEP)  for inflation.10  The SEP has served this purpose before."
"  The FOMC statement itself can , in the new regime , also be used as a platform to communicate the Committee’s tolerance for deviations of inflation from the 2 percent  longer -run goal, and, indeed, it has served this purpose in the past —for example , with the threshold -based guidance linked to inflation outcomes introduced in  the FOMC statement in December 2012.11                                                  10 The most recent SEP, an addendum to the minutes of the September 2020 FOMC meeting, is available on the Board’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm ."
" 11 The guidance from the December 2012 FOMC statement was the following :  “To support continued progress toward m aximum employment and price stability, the Committee expects that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens."
" In particular, the Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and currently anticipates that this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above  61/2 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee’s 2 percent longer -run goal, and longer -term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored”  (paragraph 5)."
"  Once the conditions to commence policy normalization have been met, the SEP “dot plot” will convey the median participant’s projections over a three -year horizon not only for inflation, but also for the pace of l iftoff as well as the ultimate destination for the policy rate."
" That is, as in Ber nanke, Kiley, and Roberts  (2019), the goal of monetary policy after lifting off from the ELB  is to return inflation to its 2 percent  longer -run goal, but not to push inflation below 2 percent."
" In other words, after liftoff from the ELB, monetary policy re verts to simple f lexible inflation targeting (Bernanke, 2017b)."
" In the Bernanke, Kiley, and Roberts (2019) study, flexible inflation targetin g post -liftoff is implemented with an inertial Taylor rule that satisfies the Taylor principle (that is, the polic y responds to the difference between actual inflation and the 2 percent target with a coefficient that exceeds unity)."
 The policy is flexible in that the desired pace of return to 2 percent  can reflect considerations other than the 2  percent  longer -run goal for inflation that are relevant to the Committee’s mandate.
" In the case of the Federal Reserve, we have highlighted that making sure that inflation expectations  - 8 - remain anchored at our 2  percent  objective is just such a consideration."
" Speaking for myse lf, I follow closely the Fed staff’s i ndex of c ommon i nflation e xpectations (CIE) as a relevant indicator that this goal is being met.12  Other things being equal, if at the time of liftoff the CIE index is below its pre -ELB  level, then my desired pace of policy normalization post -liftoff to return inflation to 2  percent —as well as the projected pace of return to 2  percent  inflation —would be somewhat slower than if the CIE index at the time of liftoff is equal to its pre -ELB  level."
" Another factor I will consider in calibrating the pace of policy normalization post -liftoff is the average rate of PCE inflation since the new framework was adopted in August 2020—a time, as it happened, that the federal funds rate was constrained at the ELB ."
" If average inflat ion since August 2020 turns out to be notably below 2 percent , then my desired pace of policy normalization post -liftoff —and the implied pace of return to 2 percent  inflation —would, other things being equal, be somewhat slower than if average inflation sin ce adoption was close to or equal to 2 percent ."
" It is important to note, however, that the goal of the new framework is to keep inflation expectations well anchored at 2  percent,  and, for this reason, I myself plan to focus more on indicators of inflation expectations themselves—especially survey -based measures—than I will on the calculation of an average rate of inflation over any particular window of time."
" Fifth element Our framework aims  ex ante for inflation to average 2 percent  over time, but it does not make a (time -inconsistent ) commitment to achieve ex post inflation outcomes that average 2  percent  under any and all circumstances and constellations of shocks."
" In this regime, the only way in which average inflation enters the policy rule is through the timing of liftoff itself."
"  Yet in stochastic simulations of the FRB /US model under TPLT with  a one -year memory that reverts to flexible inflation targeting after liftoff, inflation does average very close to 2 percent  in the stochastic simulations reported in their paper ."
" The model of Mertens and Williams  (2019) delivers a similar outcome:  Even though the policy reaction functio n in their model does not incorporate an ex post makeup element, it delivers a longrun (unconditional) average rate of inflation equal to target by aiming for a moderate inflation overshoot away from the ELB that is calibrated to offset the inflation shor tfall caused by the ELB."
" Looking ahead, we will continue to monitor deve lopments and  - 10 - assess how our ongoing asset purchases can best support achieving our maximum -employment and price -stability objectives."
" In this regard, I note that the simulation results reported in Bernanke (2020) suggest that, in general, a monetary polic y at the ELB  that combines threshold forward guidance , such as I  have discussed in these remarks, with large -scale a sset purchases, such as w e have had in place since March, is best equipped ex ante to achieve inflation outcomes that are consistent with pr ice stability  and wellanchored inflation expectations at the 2 percent  objective."
" The New Framework and Maximum Employment  An important evolution in our new f ramework is that the Committee now defines maximum employment as the highest level of employment  that does not generate sustained pressures that put the price -stability mandate at risk.13  As a practical matter, this definition means to me that , when the  unemployment rate is elevated relative to my SEP projection of  its long -run level and other indicators —such as the prime -age employment -topopulation and labor force participation ratios —are depressed relative to recent business cycle peaks, monetary policy should, as before, continue to be calibrated to eliminate such employment shortfalls as long as doing so does not put the price -stability mandate at risk."
" Indeed, in our September FOMC statement, we indicated that we expect it will be appropriate to keep the federal funds rate in the current 0 to 25 basis point target range until inflation has  reached 2  percent  (on an annual basis)  and labor                                                  13 The Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy articulates this concept with the following:  “ The maximum level of employment is a broadbased and inclusive goal  that is not directly measurable and changes  over time owing largely to nonmone tary factors that affect the structure and dynamics of the labor market."
"Consequently, it would not be appropriate to specify a fixed goal for employment; rather, the Committee's policy decisions must be informed by assessments of the shortfalls of employm ent from its maximum level, recognizing that such assessments are necessarily uncertain and subject to revision."
  - 11 - market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessment of maximum employment.
" In our new framework, when in a business cycle expansion labor market indicators return to a range th at, in the C ommittee’s judgment, is broadly consistent with its maximum -employment mandate, it will be data on inflation itself that policy will react to , but going forward, policy will not tighten solely because the unemployment rate has fallen below any particular econometric estimate of it s longrun natural level."
" In particular, I will continue —as I h ave done since joining the Fed—to consult policy r ules that respect the Taylor principle as a benchmark for calibrating the pace and destination of policy rate normalization once, after the inflation and employment thresholds have been reached, the process of policy normalization commences."
" Consistent wi th our new framework, the relevant policy rule benchmark I will consult after the conditions for liftoff have been met is an inertial Taylor -type rule with a coefficient of zero on the unemployment gap, a coefficient of 1.5 on the gap between core PCE infl ation and the 2 percent  longer -run goal, and a neutral real policy rate equal to my  SEP projection of longrun r*."
" Such a reference rule, which becomes relevant once the conditions for policy normalization have been met, is similar to the forward -looking Taylor -type rule for optimal monetary policy derived in Clarida, Gal í, and Gertler  (1999)."
" The stability properties of Taylor -type rule s in dynamic stochastic general equilibrium  models have been studied by Bullard and Mitra (2002) and Gal í (2008), among other s, and they show  - 12 - that for the standard Taylor coefficient of 1.5 on the inflation gap and a coefficient of zero on the unemployment gap, the rational expectations  equilibrium is unique for standard parametrizations."
" One dimension along which our new framework may appear to differ from the threshold forward -guidance proposals advocated by some others is that our September FOMC guidance explicitly requires that , at the time of liftoff, in addition to inflation reaching 2  percent  (on an annual basis) , labor mar ket conditions must have also reached levels consistent with the Committee ’s assessments of maximum employment, and I offered earlier the metrics on some of the labor market indicators I will follow to make that assessment."
" However, any difference between  our September FOMC guidance and similar threshold guidance policies that depend only on realized inflation is , I believe, more apparent than real."
" The reason  is that  proponents of inflation -based threshold guidance typically acknowledge that liftoff foll owing an ELB episode should be conditioned on the judgment that inflation has sustainably reached the target before liftoff is contemplated  (Bernanke, 2017b), and such a n assessment of sustainability in most circumstances would , I believe , be informed by a n assessment of labor market conditions (Reifschneider and Wilcox, 2020)."
" The C ommittee confronted just this situation in the first half of 2012, when core PCE inflation reached 2  percent  at a time when the unemployment rate remained elevated at 8.2 perce nt, well above the top of the range of FOMC estimates of its long errun normal level."
"  - 13 - Concluding Remarks  In closing, I think of our new f lexible a verage inflation -targeting framework as a combination of TPLT at the ELB with  flexible inflation t argeting , to which TPLT reverts  once the conditions to commence policy normalization articulated in our September 2020 FOMC statement have been met."
" The Committee is committed to using all available too ls, including threshold -based forward guidance as well as large -scale asset purchases, to achieve the price -stability and maximum -employment goals specified in our new consensus s tatement."
