"Bowman   Member   Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at the  2024 BOJ -IMES Conference,  hosted by the Institute for Monetary and Economic Studies, Bank of Japan   Tokyo, Japan         May 28, 2024   I would like to  thank the Bank of Japan and Governor Ueda for organizing this year’s conference and for the invitation to participate in this afternoon’s panel.1  The  topic of “the e ffects of conventional and unconventional policy instruments ” is an important one given central banks’ expanded use of unconventional monetary policy tools to pursue their mandates over the past decade and a half."
 My remarks focus on the use of the central bank balance sheet as a monetary policy tool.
 I will first offer some observations regarding the benefits and costs of large -scale asset purchases (LSAPs) by reflecting  on the two episodes of the Federal Reserve’s active use of the balance sheet in U.S. monetary policy following the 2008 financial crisis and during the COVID -19 pandemic.
" I will then discuss some considerations regarding future balance sheet policy as th e Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) seeks to bring inflation back down to its 2 percent target following the post -pandemic inflation surge, and as the FOMC continues to reduce the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet."
  Lessons Learned from Past Uses of the Federal Reserve’s Balance Sheet as a Monetary Policy Tool  Post2008 f inancial c risis balance s heet policy  A key challenge for the FOMC following the 2008 financial crisis was how to provide additional support  to an economy that was experiencing high unemployment and subdued inflation after the FOMC lowered its primary and conventional monetary policy tool—the target range for the federal funds rate —to near zero.
"   - 2 - longer -term interest rates for broader asset prices and for investment and consumption decisions, the FOMC used both forward guidance and LSAPs to help lower longer -term rates, which had not yet moved to zero."
 The intent of forward guidance was to lower longer -term interest rates by shifting expectations of “lowfor-long”  short -term interest rates in line with a low -forlong federal funds rate.
" LSAPs, or quantitative easing (QE), were intended to reduce longer -term interest rates further by lowering the y ields of specific longer -dated securities being purchased and by reducing more generally the term premia, the compensation that investors must earn to incentivize investment in a longerterm bond relative to a short -term bond."
 LSAPs could also reinforce t he FOMC’s forward guidance of low -forlong short -term interest rates.
" The progress on the FOMC’s dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability was assisted by the further easing of financial c onditions after the federal funds rate had reached its effective lower bound.5  The post –financial crisis period experience showed that securities purchases in a specific  Effects of Large -Scale Treasury Purchases:  Evidence on the Importance of Local Supply,” Journal of Financial Economics,  vol."

" In January 2019, the FOMC voted to operate monetary policy in an “ample reserves” environment .6  This change in the policy implementation framework had the effect of keeping the size of the balance sheet much larger and providing more liquidity to the banking system in normal times than had been the case before  the financial crisis."
" The FOMC ended QT in August 2019, and balance sheet growth resumed in October 2019 through the purchase of U.S. Treasury bills and securities following a brief period of stress in money markets in which the interest rates on repurchase agreements and other short -term funding instruments j umped, as noted by the line labeled “Repo Spike” in f igure 1."
" This stress was interpreted as an indication that the level of reserves had fallen below ample levels.7    Overall, one could deem the post –financial crisis use of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet as a monetary policy tool as a success."
 Unemployment fell and inflation remained near 2 percent through the period over which LSAPs were conducted.
" This much larger end state  6 See the Statement Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation and Balance Sheet Normalization , which is available on the Board’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/policy -normalization.htm ."
" - 5 - was a direct result of the FOMC’s decision to implement monetary policy in an ample -reserves operating framework and had the effect of lowering the likelihood of future volatility in short -term funding markets.8   COVID19 pandemic balance s heet policy  Given the effectiveness of the balance sheet as a monetary policy tool over the previous decade, the FOMC rapidly deployed LSAPs in March 2020 as part of its response to the pandemic.9  These purchases followed  the onset of the COVID -19 pandemic at that time, and the FOMC returned the federal funds rate to its effective lower bound."
" Following an initial higher level of Treasury and agency MBS purchases motivated both by restoring market functioning following a period of severe stress and by providing monetary policy accommodation, the FOMC began to purchase $80 billion of Treasury securities and $40 billion of agency MBS per month."
" In its December 2020 postmeeting  statement, t he FOMC communicated that it intended to continue this pace of asset purchases “until substantial further progress has been made toward the Committee ’s maximum employment and price stability goals .”10  By the end of the pandemic period asset purchases, total securities held by the Federal Reserve stood at around $8.5 trillion."
"   The U.S. Congress and the Administration also provided extraordinary fiscal support in response to the pandemic —which included stimulus checks sent to households, expanded unemployment insurance , and the Paycheck Protection Program —that bolstered household and business balance sheets.11  The housing market —recently recovered from the buildup of poorly underwritten mortgage debt in the leadup to the 2008 financial crisis and a subsequent steep decline in house prices —remained in sound condition."
 - 7 - to the buildup of inflationary pressures and the post -pandemic inflation surge?
  My own view is that the FOMC would likely have benefited from an earlier discussion and decision to begin tapering and subsequently end asset purchases in 2021 given the signs of emerging inflationary pressures.12  Doing so would have allowed the FOMC the option to have begun to tighten monetary policy earlier by raising the target range for the federal funds  rate.
 A thorough discussion of these questions  will be a useful reference for the FOMC and other central banks as they consider future use of QE as a monetary policy tool.
 - 8 - perspective would be helpful for historical reference when formulating appropriate balance sheet policy as a monetary policy response to future episodes when the conventional interest rate tool is near zero.
 These conditions included too -high inflation and a desire by the FOMC to tighten monetary policy through both the federal funds rate and the balance sheet tools.
" With the understanding that QT is a tool employed beyond conventional monetary policy restriction, how does one measure the incremental increase above the FOMC’s concurrent increases in the target range for the federal funds rate and related forward guidance regarding its policy rate?"
"Luzzetti (2024), “Quantitative Tightening Around the Globe:  What Have We Learned?” NBER Working Paper Series 32321 (Cambridge,  Mass.:  National Bureau of Economic Research, April), https://www.nber.org/papers/w32321; and Lorie Logan (2024) , “Discussion of  - 9 - helpful to policymakers in their future deliberations regarding use of the balance sheet in setting monetary policy."
" Future Considerations regarding the Federal Reserve’s Balance Sheet Policy    Looking ahead, the FOMC continues to reduce the size of its balance sheet as it seeks to maintain a sufficiently restrictive stance of monetary policy to bring inflation back down to its 2 percent goal."
" In light of these conditions, I would have supported either waiting to slow the pace of balance sheet runoff to a later point in time or implementing a more tapered slowing in the pace of runoff.17     ‘Quantitative Tightening Around the Globe:  What Have We Learned?’ by Wenxin Du, Kristin Forbes and Matthew Luzzetti,” speech delivered at the 2024 U.S. Monetary Policy Forum sponsored by the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, March 1, https://www.dallasfed.org/news/speeches/logan/2024/lkl240301."
 The FOMC will be monitoring money market conditions and related interest rates as it assesses the point at which reserve levels reach ample.19  It will be important to communicate that any future changes to balance sheet runoff do not reflect a change in the FOMC’s monetary policy stance.
" For example, the FOMC could reduce its holdings of shorter -dated Treasur y securit ies in favor of longer -dated Treasur y securit ies in a future scenario in which the FOMC wanted to provide monetary policy accommodation via the balance sheet without expanding the size of its securities holdings."
" In my view, when the Federal Reserve purchases securities for such purposes, it should communicate that those purchases will be temporary and subsequently unwound when financial market conditions have normalized .22  In conclusion, the FOMC’s past experiences with using the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet as a monetary policy tool have demonstrated that the central bank balance sheet can be an effective way to ease financial conditions and support the economy in periods in which the conventional monetary policy interest rate tool has reached the zero lower bound."
"    Just as when using the conventional monetary policy interest rate, monetary policymakers must use the balance sheet judiciously when setting monetary policy."
 Policymakers must also consider the risks of “doing too little” in balance with the risks of “doing too much” as they pursue their monetary policy mandates.
