" The Fed’s organization reflects a long -standing desire in American history to ensure that power over our nation’s monetary policy and financial system is not concentrated in a few hands, whether in Washington or in high finance or in any single group or constituency."
 People in the newer western parts of the country saw themselves as starved of access to credit and viewed higher interest rates i n their areas as reflecting the scarcity of funds.
" Regional interest rate differentials persisted until around the time of World War I and helped shape the attitudes of Americans living in western areas toward the nation’s financial system.4 These regional differences gave rise to a major political movement in the latter part of the 19th century, as western farm borrowers increasingly demanded a reform of the U.S. monetary system."
 Their chief complaints included the high interest rates they faced as well as the burdens placed on them by deflation that increased the real value of their debts.
" The country’s currency was linked to gold, and deflation reflected the growing scarcity of gold relative to the amount of economic activity."
 Economic historians have debated the extent to which interest rate differentials reflected market segmentation and supply versus demand in each market.
" Its most famous advocate, William Jennings Bryan, the Democratic presidential nominee in 1896, sought  an increase in the money supply --by the coining of silver in addition to gold--as a solution to reversing this deflation (figure 5).5 The Founding of the Fed By the beginning of the 20th century, the debate about monetary policy and the nation’s financial sy stem had been going on for over a century."
" These episodes exposed the weakness of our 19th century financial system, which repeatedly failed to supply the money and credit needed to meet the economy’s demands."
" The financial system came under severe stress when the demand for liquidity surged.7  A                                                  5 For a sense of the regionalism of this debate, believe it or not, The Wonderful Wizard of Oz  has been interpreted as an allegory for 19th century regional monetary problems, though there is little evidence about the intentions of its author, L."
7 Contemporaries blamed these crises on the seasonality in demand for currency and credit related to planting and harvesting of crops in the spring and fall.
" In the context of the gold standard, poor money supply growth in the United States triggered certain expectations by international capital market participants that interest rates in the United States w ould rise  - 5 - financial system strained in such a manner is like dry kindling in danger of being exposed to a spark."
" When demands for liquidity rise, central banks can respond by increasing the supply of money and thus adding liquidity to the system."
 Central banks have a particularly important role in avoiding or mitigating extreme demands for liquidity during financial crises.
 They do this by making loans to solvent financial institutions so they can meet their liquidity demands and avoid forced sales of the ir assets.
" As a result, interest rates on American commercial paper (a key rate affected by international financial conditions) rose following poor harvests, stock and bond prices fell, and deposits flowed out of the New York banking system."
"  - 6 - The final catalyst leading to the creation of the Federal Reserve was the severe Panic of 1907, which caused inflationadjusted gross national product to decline by 12 percent, more than two times the decline recorded during the Great Recession of 2007 to 2009.9  After the panic ended, there was a broad sense that reform was needed, although consensus on the exact nature of that reform was elusive."
 They had also led to the almost universal adoption of  usury ceilings on interest rates (typically 6 percent) that were more honored in name than reality.

  - 10 - Members of the Board of Governors and Presidents of the Reserve Banks arrive at their own independent viewpoints about the economy and the appropriate path for monetary policy.
"Congress has assigned the FOMC the task of achieving stable prices and maximum employment; however, policymakers may disagree on the best way to achieve those goals.19  The System’s structure encourages exploration of a diverse range of views and promotes a hea lthy policy debate.20  In the modern Federal Reserve System, each Reserve Bank has an independent research department, with its own external publications."
" Before each FOMC meeting, Reserve Bank Presidents consult with their staff of economists as well as their boards of directors, business contact s in their Districts, and market experts to develop their independent views of appropriate monetary policy."
"                                                  19 For a discussion of the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate, see the FOMC’s Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Str ategy, which the Committee first issued in January 2012 and reaffirms annually, in note 2 6."
 The Chair testifies before Congress twice each year about th e U.S. economy and the FOMC’s monetary policy in pursuit of its statutory goals of stable prices and maximum employment (figure 12).22  The Federal Reserve Board prepares a Monetary Policy Report  to accompany that testimony.23  The Chair also holds press conferences after four FOMC meetings each year.
 23 The Monetary Policy Report  is available on the Board’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/mpr_default.htm .
"25 Since 2012, the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) has included each individual FOMC participant’s assessment of appropriate monetar y policy in the form of an interest rate “dot plot.”  The SEP is available on the Board’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm ."
" - 12 - Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, which is reaffirmed every January."
" This statement discusses the Committee’s interpretation of its statutory goals of maximum employment and price stability; it indicates that the Committee judges inflation of 2 percent, as measured by the annual change in the price index  for personal consumption expenditures, to be most consistent over the longer run with the Federal Reserve’s statutory mandate.26  Transcripts of FOMC meetings are released to the public after a delay of about five years."
 Transparency can also make monetary policy more effective by helping to guide the public’s expectations and clarify the Committee’s policy intentions.

" Conclusion  The long history of political discourse in the United States helps explain the Federal Reserve’s unique structure, in which the Board of Governors in Washington and the 12 regional Reserve Banks share power over monetary policy (as shown in figure 1)."
