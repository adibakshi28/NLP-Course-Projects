" I  will briefly cover three areas in my remarks :  (1) the Federal Reserve’s  commitment to transparency and accountabi lity, (2) financial stability  and financial reform , and (3) monetary policy."
" I had long advocated increased transparency and, in particular, a more explicit policy framework as ways to make monetary policy more predictable and more effective."
" Our efforts to e nhance transparency and communication have indeed made monetary policy more effective, but, as I’ll discuss, these steps have proved important in other spheres as well."
 When I began my term I expected to build on the monetary policy framework I had inherit ed from  Paul Volcker and Alan Greenspan.
" My predecessors had solidified the Fed’s commitment to low and stable inflation  as a foundation of broader economic stability,  and they  gradually increased the transparency of monetary policy  deliberations and plans ."
" For example, Chairman Volcker introduced a money -targeting framework to help guide the Fed’s attack on high inflation in the early 1980s, and the practice of issuing a statement after each meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) began under  Chairman Greenspan."
 I believed  that a still more transparent approach would make monetary policy even more effective and further strengthen the Fed’s  - 2 - institutional credibility.
 I was confident that we co uld adapt this type of framework to the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate to promote both maximum employment and price stability.
" Indeed, central banks using this framework were already, in practice, often pursuing economic objectives in addition to low and stable inflation --hence the term, “flexible” inflation targeting."
" In the minutes of its October 2007 meeting , the FOMC introduced its quarterly Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), which included FOMC participants’ projections of key macroeconomic variables such as infla tion, gross domestic product (GDP) growth, and the unemployment rate.1  Over time, we added long -run projections of inflation, growth,                                                  1 Prior to October 2007, FOMC participants provided semiannual projections of nominal and real GDP, unemployment, and core inflation, which were reported in the meeting minutes and in the Monetary Policy Report to the Congress ."
" The innovations associated with the introduction of the SEP  included (1) the switch from semiannual to quarterly frequency, (2) the addition of projections for overall inflation (projections of nominal GDP growth were dropped), (3)  the extension by two years of the projection horizon, (4) the inclusion of participants’ views about the risks to and the uncertainty surrounding the outlook for each projected variable, (5) the inclusion of the full distribution of participants’ projections, not just the range and central tendency, and 6) a write -up of the rationales provided by participants for their projections."
"  As noted in the text, further innovations, including interest rate projections and longrun projections of economic growth, u nemployment, inflation, and the federal funds rate were added over time."
"  The role of the projections in policy communication was also significantly increased after October  - 3 - and unemployment, as well as projections of the path of the target federal funds rate consistent with each individual’s views of appropriate monetary policy."
 These additions have better informed the public about participants’ views on both the long -run objectives of policy and the path of interest rates most consistent with achieving those objectives.
"  We took another important step in January 2012, when the FOMC issued a statement laying out its longer -run goals and policy strategy.2  The statement established, for the first time, an explicit longer -run goal for inflation of 2 percent, and it pointed to the SEP to provide information about Committee participants’ assessments of the longer -run normal unemployment rate, currently between 5.2 and 6 percent."
 The statement also indicated that the Committee would take a balanced approach to its price stability and employment obj ectives.
 T he increases in policy transparency that were achieved proved valuable during a very difficult period for monetary policy.
" (See the webpage “Credit and Liquidity Programs and the Balance Sheet ” at www.federalreserve.gov /monetarypolicy/bst.htm.)  4 While the Government Accountability Office ( GAO)  has access to all aspects of the Fed’s operations and is free to criticize or make recommendations, there is one important exception:  monetary policymaking."
"  In the 1970s, the Congress deliberately excluded monetary policy deliberations, decisions, and actions from the scope of GAO reviews."
"  In doing so, the Congress carefully balanced the need for democratic accountability with the benefits that flow from keeping monetary policy free from short -term political pressures."
" However, there have been recent proposals (so -called Audit the Fed measures) to expand the authority of the GAO over the Federal Reserve to include reviews of monetary policy decisions."
"  Because the GAO is the inve stigative arm of the Congress and GAO reviews may be initiated at the request of members of the Congress, these reviews (or the prospect of reviews) of individual policy decisions could be seen, with good reason, as efforts to bring political pressure to bear on monetary policymakers."
  A perceived politicization of monetary policy would reduce public confidence in the ability of the Federal Reserve to make its policy decisions based strictly on what is good for the economy in the longer term.
"  Balancing the  need for accountability against the goal of insulating monetary policy from short -term political pressures is very important, and I believe that the Congress had it right in the 1970s when it explicitly chose to protect monetary policy decisionmaking from  the possibility of politically motivated reviews."
"  However, more remains to  be done to better understa nd how to design and implement more effective macroprudential tools and how these tools inte ract with  monetary policy ."
"Monetary Policy  While liquidity provision and other emergency steps were  critical to stemming the financial panic, a rapid shift in the stance of monetary policy was necessary to counteract the massive economic blow delivered by  the crisis."
"  To provide additional monetary policy accommodation despite the constraint imposed by the effective lower bound on interest rates, t he Federal Reserve turned to two alternative  tools:  enhanced forward guidance regarding the likely path of the federal funds rate  and large -scale purchase s of longer -term securities for the Federal Reserve ’s portfolio."
" For example, t he Bank of England and the Bank of Japan have  - 12 - employed  detailed  forward guidance and conducted large -scale asset purchases , while the European Central Bank has moved to reduce the perceived risk of sovereign debt, provided banks with substantial liquidity, and offered qualitative guidance regarding the future path of interest rates ."
"With short -term rates near zero, expanded guidance about intentions for future policy has helped to shape  market expectations, which in turn has eased financial conditions by putting downward pressure on longer -term interest rates a nd helped support economic activity."
" Forward guidance about the short -term interest rate supplements the broader policy framework I described earlier, by providing information about how the Committee expects to achieve its stated policy objectives despite  the complications created by the zero lower bound on the policy interest rate and uncertainties about the costs and efficacy of the available policy tools."
" In December 2012, the Committee introduced state -contingent guidance, announcing for the first time that no increase in the federal funds rate target should be anticipated so long as unemployment remain ed above 6 -1/2 percent , inflation between one and two years ahead was projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee’s 2 percent longer -run goal, and longer -term inflation expectations continue d to be well anchored .12  My colleagues and I emph asized that the conditions stated in that guidance were thresholds, not triggers."
 Large -scale asset purchases also provide monetary accommodation by lowering longterm interest rates .
" In particular, the FOMC’s decision to modestly reduce the pace of asset purchases at its December meeting did not indicate any dimin ution of its commitment to maintain a highly accommodative monetary policy  for as long as needed ; rather, it reflected the progress we have made toward our goal of substantial improvement in the labor market outlook that we set out when we began the current purchase program in September 2012."
" At its most recent meeting, t he Committee  reaffirmed and clarified its guidance on rates, stating that it expects to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate well past the time that the unemployment threshold of 61/2 percent is crossed, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee’s 2 percent longer -run goal.13 Have these unconventional tools been effective?"
" Skeptics have pointed out that the pace of recovery has been disappointingly slow, with inflation -adjusted GDP growth averaging only slightly higher than a 2 percent annual rate over the past few years and inflation below the Committee’s 2 percent longer -term target."
"  - 14 - the recovery has faced powerful headwinds, suggesting that economic growth might well have been considerably weaker, or even negative, without substantial  monetary policy support."
" For example, changes in guidance appear to shift interest  rate expectations, and the preponderance of studies show that asset purchases push down longer -term interest rates and boost asset prices.14  These changes in financial conditions in turn appear  to have provided material support to the economy.15 Once the economy improves sufficiently so that  unconventional tools are no longer needed, the Committee will face issues of policy implementation and, ultimately, the design of the policy framework."
" Under the operating procedures  used  prior to the crisis, the presence of large quantities of excess reserves likely would h ave impeded the FOMC’s ability to raise short -term nominal interest rates when appropriate."
" The interest rate on excess reserves can be raised, which will put upward pressure on short -term rates; in addition, the Federal Reserve will be able to employ other tools, such as fixed -rate overnight reverse repurchase agreements, term deposits, or term                                                  14 There is a substantial recent research literature that has tried to quantify the effects of balance sheet policies on asset pricing."
" As a result, at the appropriate time, the FOMC will be able to return to conducting monetary policy primarily through adjustments in the short -term policy rate."
" It is possible, however, that some specific aspects of the Federal Reserve’s operating framework will change; the Committee will be considering this question in the future, taking into account what it learned from its experience with an expanded balance sheet and new tools for managing interest rates."
  Payroll employment has risen by  71/2 million jobs  from its trough.
 T he unemployment rate has fallen from 10 percent in the fall of 2009 to 7 perce nt recently.
" At 7 percent, the unemployment rate still is  elevated."
" The number of long -term unemployed remains  unusually high, and other measures of labor underutilization, such as the number of  - 16 - people who are working part  time  for economic reasons, have improved less than the unemployment rate ."
" As Carmen Reinhart  and Ken Rogoff noted in their prescient research , economic activity  following financial crises tends to be anemic, especially when the preceding economic expansion was accompanied by rapid growth in credit and real estate prices.16  Weak recoveries from financial crises reflect , in part, the process of delevera ging and balance sheet repair:  Households pull back on spending  to recoup lost wealth and reduce debt burdens , while  financial institutions  restrict credit to restore capital ratios and reduce the riskiness of their portfolios."
  - 17 - been too pessimistic in our forecasts of the unemployment rate.
" For example, over the past year unemployment has declined notably more quickly than we or other forecasters expected , even as GDP growth was moderately lower than expected a year ago."
" This discrepancy reflects a nu mber of factors, including declines in participation, but an important reason is the slow growth of productivity during this recovery; intuitively, when productivity gains are limited, firms need more workers even if demand is growing slowly."
" Disappointing productivity growth accordingly must be added to the list of reasons that economic growth has been slower than hoped.17  (Incidentally, the slow pace of productivity gains early in the recovery was not evident until well after the fact because of large data revisions --an illustration of the frustrations of real -time policymaking.)  The reasons for weak productivity growth are not entirely clear:  It may be a result of the severity of the financial crisis, for example, if tight credit conditions have inhibi ted innovation, productivity -improving investments, and the formation of new firms; or it may simply reflect slow growth in sales, which have led firms to use capital and labor less intensively, or even mismeasurement."
" N otably, productivity growth has also flagged in a number of foreign economies that were hard -hit by the financial crisis."
 Yet another possibility is weak productivity growth reflects longer -term trends largely unrelated to the recession.
" Obviously, the resolution of the productivity puzzl e will be important in shaping our expectations for longer -term growth."
" To this list of reasons for the slow recovery --the effects of the financial crisis, problems in the housing and mortgage markets, weaker -thanexpected productivity growth, and events i n Europe and elsewhere --I would add one more significant factor --                                                 17 For a review of some of this recent literature, see Reifschneider, Wascher, and Wilcox (2013)."
" Other recent research on potential growth includes De Michelis, Estev ão, and Wilson (2013) and Haltmaier (2012)."
" Federal fiscal policy was expansionary in 2009 and 2010.18  Since that time, however, federal fiscal policy has turned quite restrictive; according to the Congressional  Budget Office, tax increases and spending cuts likely lowered output growth in 2013 by as much as 11/2 percentage points."
" To illustrate the extent of fiscal tightness, at the current point in the recovery from the 2001 recession, employment at all levels of government had increased by nearly 600,000 workers; in contrast, in the current recovery, government employment has declined by more than 700,000 jobs, a net difference of more than 1.3 million jobs."
" Most importantly, with fiscal and monetary policy working in opposite directions, the recovery is weaker than it otherwise would be."
" But the current policy mix is particularly problematic when interest rates are very low, as is the case today."
" Monetary policy has less room to maneuver when interest rates are close to zero, while expansion ary fiscal policy is likely both more effective and less costly in terms of increased debt burden when interest rates are pinned at low levels."
" A more balanced policy mix might also avoid some of the costs of very low interest rates, such as potential ris ks to financial stability, without sacrificing jobs and growth."
" Near -term fiscal policy at the federal level remains restrictive , but the degree of restraint on economic growth seems likely to lessen somewhat  in 2014 and even more so in 2015; meanwhile, the budgetary situ ations of state and local governments have improved, reducing the need for further sharp cuts."
" The combination of financial healing, greater balance in the housing market, less fiscal restraint, and, of course, continued monetary policy accommodation bodes well for U.S. economic growth in coming quarters."
" Although difficult reforms --such as banking and fiscal reform in Europe and structural reform in Japan --are still in early stages, we have also seen indications of better growth in the advanced economies, which sh ould have positive implications for the United States."
" Although growth prospects for the em erging markets continue to be good, here too the extent and effectiveness of structural reforms, like those currently under  way in China and Mexico, will be critical factors."
" The experience has led to important changes at our institution, including new monetary policy tools, enhanced policy communication, a substantial increase in the institutional focus on financial stability and macroprudential policy , and increased transparency."
