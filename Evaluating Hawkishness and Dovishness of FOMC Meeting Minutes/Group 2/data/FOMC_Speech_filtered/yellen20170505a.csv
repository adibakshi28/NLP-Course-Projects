" If these obstacles persist, we will squander the potential of many of our citizens and incur a substantial loss to the productive capacity of our economy at a time when the aging of the population and weak productivity growth are already weighing on economic growth."
" African American women were about twic e as likely to participate in the labor force as were white women at the time, largely because they were more likely to remain in the labor force after marriage.3                                                    2 My discussion of the history of female labor force participation draws heavily on the pioneering work of Claudia Goldin, including her 2006 Ely Lecture “The Quiet Revolution that Transformed Women’s Employment, Education, and Family” to the American Economic Association and her 1990 work Understanding the Gender Gap:  An Economic History of American Women , from which the statistics on female labo r force participation from the late 19 th century until the mid -20th century are drawn."
" First, with the advent of mass high sch ool education, graduation rates rose substantially.8  At the same time, new technologies contributed to an increased demand for clerical workers, and these jobs were increasingly taken on by women."
" As time progressed, attitudes about women working and their employment prospects did change."
" But, from the late 1950s on, it also increasingly graduated writers, doctors, lawyers, diplomats, physicians, psychotherapists, and archeologists, and,                                                  10 For instance, although many women who had joined the war effort in the 1940s were fired at the end of the war, as the Korean War effort picked up and the demand for the labor of women rose, women, who had learned that they could combine work and family wer e ready to reenter the labor force, so that by the early 1950s female labor force participation resumed its war -time high  (Kessler -Harris , 1982, pp."
" Moreover, many of the labor protections promoted to protect women were often based on theories about women’s weaker nature, and these protections served to circumscribe their work.15  During the Great Depression, limiting women’s role in the workforce was considered a way to address the high rates of unemployment, although the experience of those years showed the importance of women in supporting their families financially.16  Similarly, women who had successfully worked during World War II, either as part of the war effort or to support their families while their husbands were fighting, often were pushed out of their jobs to make room for returning soldiers.17  After the war and then single, my relative, Betty Stafford, remained an assistant professor at the University of Wisconsin despite an enviable body of research."
"  Despite the fears of some that women entering into the workforce would crowd out men, the evidence shows that the rise in women’s participation has contributed to widespread improvements in the safety and productivity of our workplaces, to the health of families, and to the macroeconomic success that our country has enjoyed over the past 125 years."
" Women’s demands for safer factories, humane workweeks, and higher pay, which were often pursued through organizing and striking, contributed substantially to the social upheaval and public debate of that period that eventually led to the passage of stronger labor standards."
" Between 1948 and 1990, the rise in female participation contributed about 1/2 percentage point per year to the potential growth rate of real gross domestic product.24  And this estimate does not take into account the effect of the increases in women’s education and work experience that also occurred over that period and boosted their productivity."
" If it is costly for employees to share information and split the work, then there would be a high premium, in the form of compensation, for those who can work the long hours.36  Workplaces where the income of employees depends on the effort of co -workers, such as law partnerships, also have an incentive to require long workweeks.37   But h owever sensible such  arrangement s may be from a business perspective, it can be difficult for women to meet the demands in these fields once they have children."
"  - 16 - is to demand complete scheduling flexibility, which can result in too few hours of work for those with family demands and can make it diffic ult to schedule childcare.40  Reforms that encourage companies to provide some predictability in schedules, cross -train workers to perform different tasks , or require a minimum guaranteed number of hours in exchange for flexibility could improve the lives of workers holding such jobs."
" The experience in Europe suggests picking policies that do not  narrowly target childbirth, but instead can be used to meet a variety o f the health and caregiving responsibilities.48                                                   44 Note that Blau and Kahn  (2013) do not find that improvement  in the provision of childcare  in other advanced economies relative to the United States explain the divergence in participation since the 1990s; however, Thévenon (2013) finds that the greater provision of childcare  has a positive effect on full -time employment."
