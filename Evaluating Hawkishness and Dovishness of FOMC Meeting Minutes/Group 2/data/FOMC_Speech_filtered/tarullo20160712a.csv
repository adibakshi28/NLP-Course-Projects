"  2 A work ing definition of runnable liabilities is provided by Jack Bao , Josh David, and Song Han  in “The Runnables,” FED S Notes, September 3, 2015, www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/notes/feds -notes/2015/the -runnables -20150903.html:  We define “runnables ” as “payon-demand ” transactions which embed defaultable promises made by private agents or state and local governments w ithout explicit insurance from the federal government."
A transaction is considered “ payon-demand ” if its term to maturity is short or the claimholder of the long -term debt has a put option that can be exercised on short notice.
"In general, the pay -ondema nd feature implies that in the event of stress --caused by credit -risk concerns, large swings in short -term interest rates, or deteriorations in market liquidity --investors may exhibit bank -runlike behavior by redeeming their shares, unwinding their transa ctions, or deciding not to roll over their positions."
" An additional, important consideration here is that at least some of the short -term funding instruments implicated in this analysis respond not just to the desire of their creators for funding that is cheaper than equity or longer -term debt, but also to the demand of many entities --from other financial firms to pension funds to foreign sovereigns --for “safe” assets."
" As the term implies, these assets must be reliable stores of value that are readily available for use-- features sometimes characteri zed as “money -like.”  6    Obvious forms of safe assets include currency itself (though that has its well -known limitations for large -value transacting), government -insured demand deposits, and obligations of highly creditworthy sovereigns such as U.S. Treasurie s."
" But numerous commentators have observed that, for a variety of reasons, demand for safe assets in recent decades has been growing substantially faster than the supply of these most obvious and truly safe forms of government -backed assets.4  In these ci rcumstances, they note, the demand for privately created safe assets has increased."
" Fourth, as a factual matter, to what extent is the supply of short -term funding a response to a persistent demand for more safe assets?"
" If the answer is “considerable,” then further cons traints on the creation of currently used safe assets might result in further financial engineering in search of assets that approximate the attributes of truly safe assets even less well, but are the best the demanders of these assets can do."
" This is clearly a big question that runs well beyond the scope of even the most far -reaching financial regulatory debates and initiatives of the post -crisis                                                            4 For some of the factors involved in this increased demand, see Daniel K."
