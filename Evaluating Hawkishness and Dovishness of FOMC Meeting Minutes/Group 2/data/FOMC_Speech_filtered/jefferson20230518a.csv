"  For release on delivery  9:05 a.m. EDT   May 18, 2023          The U.S. Economic Outlook and Considerations  for Monetary Policy     Remarks by   Phillip N."
"econom y, credit conditions , and monetary policy."
"Aggregate Economic Activity  Despite heightened uncertainty, due to  banking -sector stress, geopolitical instability , and the aftermath of the pandemic , I expect the econo my to grow in the second quarter ."
" The pace of growth, however, will be slower than what we observed in the first  quarter , when real GDP increased at an annual rate of 1.1 percent."
" While my base case forecast for the U.S. economy is not a recession, I expect spending and GDP growth to remain quite slow over the rest of 2023, due to  continued tight  financial conditions, low consumer sentiment, and a decline in househol d savings that had built up after the onset of the pandemic."
"  Further more , I acknowledge that there are  downside risks, among them the possibility  that the degree of  bank lending  restraint  and uncertainty could weigh on economic activity  more than I expect ."
"The Labor Market  Even as GDP growth has slowed, employment has continued to increase, and the current labor market is one of the stronges t that U.S. workers have experienced in   - 2 - decades."
" The economy created  253,000 jobs in April and the unemployment rate was 3.4 percent, the lowest since 1969."
Wage growth has continued to run ahead of the pace consistent with 2 percent inflation and current trends in productivity growth.
" Over the 12 months ended in March 2023, the employment cost index (ECI) for total hourly compensation for private -sector workers rose 4.8 percent, down only a little from its peak of 5.5 percent last Jun e."
"     My expectation is that the slowing economy will soon begin to reduce job growth , with labor supply and labor demand coming into better balance."
 The unemployment rate  may rise  gradually  to levels still consistent with a growing economy.
" Data on jo b openings and voluntary quits by workers indicate that labor demand has eased somewhat , and this is reflected also in a modest decline in the growth of average hourly earnings, from a 12month rate of 5 percent in November to 4.4 percent in April."
 Inflation  Now let me turn to the outlook for inflation .
" While inflation  has come down substantially since last summer, it is still too high, and  by some measures progress has been slowing."
" After peaking at a 12 -month rate of 7 percent last June, personal  consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation fell to 4.2 percent in March , which is also down from 5 .1 percent in February."
 That reflects substantial decreases in energy prices and a big slowdown in food inflation .
" But outside of energy and food, the progress on inflation remains a challenge ."
" Excluding these prices, which tend to be more volat ile than prices of other goods and services , leaves what we call “core” inflation , and this measure is a useful guide to discern longer -lasting movements in  inflation."
" Core PCE inflation  was 4.6 percent in March, down from a peak of 5.4 percent in February 2022 ."
" While we do not have  a report on PCE inflation for April yet, another inflation measure, the core component  of the consumer price index  (CPI) , showed little further improvement in Ap ril."
" Looking more closely at core inflation, I like to divide it into three parts —core goods inflation ; housing, which is classified as a service ; and nonhousing services."
" Core good s inflation fell sharply over the second half of 2022  as supply -chain bot tlenecks eased , but more recently it has stabilized  at around 2.6 percent ."
" Housing services  inflation , which include s rent and the equivalent for owner -occupied homes, is 8.2 percent  on a 12 -month basis ."
" Housing is a big part of inflation, and while rent increases on new leases have come down considerably over the past year, it will take some time for this softening in rents  to show through  to the  12month changes."
"  And, finally,  inflation in nonhousing services, the largest component of services , has been stubbornly high at around 4.5 percent  and show s no signs of significant decline  yet."
" The evidence is that so far there has been only a modest incremental tightening of lending conditions, which had already tightened considerably over the past year since the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates."
" At this point, it is hard to tell how much of this tightening was in train already, after continued increases in interest rates, and it is likewise difficul t to say how much the stress in midsized banks will ultimately curtail credit in the coming year."
" Although  the profitability of  property and casualty insurance companies in  2022 was reduced by natural catastro phes and inflation , the industry’s capital appears  strong when considering a range of plausible stress events ."
" For life insurers, the recent increase in interest rates has been a mostly welcome development that has supported higher investment returns but also poses risks, such as early withdrawals by some policyholders."
"With that said, let me turn to monetary policy."
 Considerations for Monetary Policy  So what  factors will I consider in the coming weeks as I contemplate the appropriate stance of monetary policy going forward ?
" Over the next few weeks, we will receiv e a considerable amount of data on economic activity for April and May, including the employment report for May and a report on May CPI inflation ."
 Monetary policy should be  forward -looking .
 It should be conducted so that longer -term inflation expectations are well  anchored around our inf lation target of 2 percent.
  Monetary policy  should also be  data dependent  to allow  for continuous learn ing about the underlying  structure of the economy as new data arrive .
" These principles  of monetary policymaking are always valuable , especially so when  the level of uncertainty is high, as it is now."
  I am guided by the dual mandate assigned  to the Federal Reserve by the U.S. Congress :  price stability and maximum employment .
" On the one hand, inflation is too high, and we have not yet made  sufficient progress  on reducing it ."
" On the other hand, GDP has slowed considerably this year, and even though the effect has been muted in the labor market so far, demand clearly has begun t o feel the effects of interest rates that are 5 percentage points higher than they were a little over a year ago."
" History shows that monetary policy works with long and vari able lags, and that a year is not a long enough  period for demand to feel the full  effect of higher interest rates ."
