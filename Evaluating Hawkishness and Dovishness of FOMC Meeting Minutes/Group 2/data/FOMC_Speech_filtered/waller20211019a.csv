"For release on delivery  3:00 p.m. E DT (Noon P DT)  October 19, 2021         The Economic Outlook and a Cautionary Tale  on “Idiosyncratic ” Price Changes and Inflation    Remarks by   Christopher J."
 Today my goal is to explain my outlook for the U.S. economy as well as how that perspective shapes my views on the appropriate  approach to monetary policy.1  I have three points I woul d like you to take away from my comments.
" First, while there has been a significant slowdown in third quarter  gross domestic product ( GDP ) growth, it should rebound in the first half of 2022."
" Second, I believe that substantial progress has been made on both the inflation and em ployment legs of our dual mandate."
" Finally, the next several months are critical for assessing whether the high inflation numbers we have seen are  transitory."
" If monthly prints of inflation continue to run high through the remainder of th is year, a more aggressive policy response than just tapering may well be warr anted  in 2022."
"In terms of economic growth, data for the third quarter of 2021 show that the economic recovery slowed as the effects of the Delta variant caused  consumers and businesses to start pulling back on some forms of economic activity such as trave l and leisure."
" I and most other forecasters expect ed that real GDP  would grow close to the very strong rate posted in the first half of the year, but it now appears that GDP growth  will be closer to  3 percent at an annual rate."
" Meanwhile, we have seen labor shortages in many regions and many sectors that seem unwarranted given the level of unemployment and other indicators of slack in the labor market."
   All of this recent experience encourages me to believe that the moderation  in the expansion of economic activity in recent months that is directly related to the Delta surge will be a temporary phenomenon.
" I expect that this slowdown has only delayed the economic recovery into the first half of 2022, and thus I moved what I thought would be strong growth in the second half of this year into the first half of next year ."
" This delay means that my medium -term outlook for economic growth really has  not changed much at all, and that I forecast the strong recovery will continue ."
" Despite these unexpectedly low numbers, there is still some good news from the  September report —namely , that  the disappointing number was due to unexpected declines in employment by state and local governm ents that may be attributed to limited labor supply that will work itself out in coming months."
"  Nevertheless, the numbers ar e concerning, given that as many as 8  million workers may have rolled off  unemployment insurance programs in September."
" The September jobs report also showed the unemployment rate falling four -tenths of 1 percent , from 5.2 percent  to 4.8 percent ."
" It is striking that, in 16 months, the unemployment rate has fallen from 14.8 percent in April 2020 to just 4.8 percent  now ."
" However, one data se ries, such as the unemployment rate, is insufficient at capturing the overall status of the labor market."
Now let me focus on the Federal Reserve’s goals for monetary policy.
" As  the minutes of the September Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC)  meeting conveyed, many participants judge that we have achieved substantial progress on our inflation goal.3  With regard to substantial further progress on our employment objective, I believe we have now met that criteri on despite the disappointing jobs reports for August and September."
" Fu rthermore, the September  unemployment rate of  4.8 percent  is not that far from the 3.5  percent  unemployment rate that was realized in February 2020."
" While there is still room to improve on the employment leg of our mandate,  2 The Atlanta Fed’s spider chart and the Kansas City Fed’s measure of labor market conditions can be found on the Reserve Banks’ respective websites at https://www.atlantafed.org/chcs/labor -market -distributions  and https://www.kansascityfed.org/data -andtrends/labor -market -conditions -indic ators ."
Inflation  Inflation has been running higher this year tha n I and most forecasters expected.
" The unexpected inflation we have observed has raised costs for households and businesses and complicated their planning, which has a real effe ct on people’s lives."
"  For the Fed, the question is whether higher inflation this year undermines moving toward our economic goals."
" On that score, I continue to believe that the escalation of inflation will be transitory and that inflation will move back toward our 2 percent target next year."
"  That said, I am still  greatly  concerned about the upside risk that elevated inflation will not prove temporary."
"   As I said earlier, I still see supply and demand working here to moderate price  increases so that  inflation mov es back toward 2 percent."
 But I also see some upside pressures on inflation that bear watching.
" That apparently has  not made its way into prices yet, but how long before it becomes a factor driving inflation?"
 The simple answer is that I believe the next few months will be crucial to understanding whether elevated  rates of inflation last and if that will trigger a lasting effect on the U.S. economy.
" We will kn ow more as time goes on about whether inflation in the prices of those goods and services will level off or even fall, as lumber prices have, and how other  prices will evolve ."
" But , importantly, we will also know whether this period of higher inflation has  started to affect expectations of future inflation ."
" A critical aspect of our new framework is to allow inflation to run above our 2 percent  target (so that it averages 2 percent) , but we should do this only if inflation expectations are consistent with our 2 percent  target ."
" If inflation expectations become unanchored, the credibility of our inflation target is at risk, and we likely would need to take action to re -anchor expectations at our 2 percent  target."
"   This raises a couple of key questions:  Whose inflation expectations do we examine,  and how do we determine if they are unanchored?"
" With regard to the first question, w e measure inflation expectations two ways."
" First, we s urvey the public  and  - 7 - ask them  what they expect the inflation rate to be in coming years."
" The University of Michigan household s urvey and the New York Fed’s Survey of Consumer Expectations are examples of this “survey approach.”   Second, we can infer inflation expectations  from differences in yields between Treasury securities that are indexed for inflation and those that are not."
 These breakeven inflation measures from the T reasury I nflation -Protected Securities market are referred to as “market based ” measures of inflation compensat ion.
 Survey measures give us an idea of what the average household expects inflation to be in the coming years.
" Presumably , this measure of expectations is important because it should influence households’ wage demands as they seek compensat ion for an increasing cost of living."
" This is why I have always preferred market -based  measures of inflation expectations, because they are formed by investors who are betting with real money about future inflation."
   This brings us t o another question:  Are inflation expectations anchored around our inflation target of 2  percent ?
 Survey measures have shown a dramatic increase in inflation expectations over the p ast few months.
 The recent New York Fed measure has short - and medium -term inflation expectations at 5.
 This is eye opening and a genuine cause for concern should households embed these expectations in wage demands.
" However , marketbased measures of inflation expectations and the five -year inflation expectations from the New York Fed survey continue to be anchored near our 2 percent  target."
"  I also look at the Board of Governors staff’s common inflation expectations measure , which  distills a signal from  - 8 - both surveys and market -based inflation gauges ."
  This gives me some comfort that the recent run of high inflation readings has not led to an unanchoring of inflation expectations.
 It is important to account for all measures of inflation expectations and not “cherry pick” the measure that one finds most comforting.
 I would like to follow up on this last point as it pertains to thinking about inflation.
" As I mentioned earlier, a lot of commentators,  including me , have deflected concerns about high inflation readings being the result of “ outliers ” or “idiosyncratic ” price movements."
" As a result, recent high inflation readings are transitory and not broad  based."
  But there is a fallacy in doing so tha t one should avoid in judging whether higher inflation is indeed transitory.
" There are sound reasons for this, such as when we exclude volatile food and energy prices to get a measure of “core” inflation ; that kind of measure  often is more stable and can tell us whether the underlying forces behind inflation are moving as rapidly as it might seem from headline inflation."
" A similar logic applies to trimmed  mean measures of inflation , such as the Cleveland Fed t rimmed mean consumer price index and the Dallas Fed trimmed m ean PCE  (personal consumption expenditures) inflation rate ."
 These measures censor the tails of the price change distribution to avoid having average inflation distorted by extreme price movements.
" As a result, we may be led to “falsel y” dismiss certain price movements and risk being misled as to the true inflation rate."
" Thus, average inflation is 2 percent  every year , and there is no reason to question that measure, as it is broad  based."
This is typically what we have in mind when we think about trend inflation.
" In this world, inflation is meeting the FOMC’s 2 percent target and there is no need for a policy change."
" If we a ssum e equal weights for each good, the inflation rate for this economy is 3 percent."
" In this economy, inflation averages 3 percent each year, which is above the FOMC’s 2 percent inflation target."
" First, if one used a trimmed -mean measure of inflation, you w ould throw out the highest and the lowest readings for each year."
 The average inflation rate would be 2 percent every year.
" Thus, over a three -year period, a trimmed mean measure of inflation would be 2 percent  and indicate we are hitti ng our inflation target when the true measure would be 3  percent per year."
" A second way of manipulating the data is to say in year 1 , “Look, inflation is being driven by good A, which had an idiosyncratic, outsized price increase."
" If you throw it out, the underlying inflation rate is 2 percent .”  Then in year 2, you say, “Good B  - 10 - had an idiosyncratic price increase, so throw it out.”  R epeat for year 3."
" Again, by selectively throwing out unusually high price increases for individual goods, you would conclude that inflation over the three -year period is 2 percent and we are hitting the inflation target when , in fact , it was 3 percent ."
"So, based on these goods, we are hitting our inflation target."
" Finally, one could claim, correctly, that the large price increase for good A is “transitory” —it went up strikingly in year 1 but then dropped back, meaning inflation should fall back to our inflation target in coming periods."
"But that will mislead you in terms of understanding the true inflation rate, because you are putting zero probability that a large spike in inflation will happen to another good in the future."
" The moral of this little example is that one needs to be careful when  selectively ignoring data series —be it used car prices, food and energy prices , or household surveys of inflation expectations."
" All of these series convey important information about the evolution of inflation, and one should exhibit caution in dismissing data as outliers."
" W e must keep our eyes open to inflationary pressures, wherever they come from, with consistency and rigor and stand ready to adjust policy if we conclude that such a change is warranted."
 Our test for this step was making “substantial further progress” toward our employment and inflation goals.
" After years of running below 2 percent, the recent and sustained increase in inflation clearly represents substantial pro gress toward our goal."
" And the continued gains in employment , despite a couple of months of a slowdown, along with results across a range of labor market indicators , indicate to me that there has also been substantial further progress toward maximum employment."
" I believe the pace of continued improvement in the labor market will be gradual, and I expect inflation will moderate , which means liftoff is still some time  off."
"  That said , as I mentioned earlier, if my upside risk for inflation comes to pass, with inflation considerably above 2 percent well into 2022, then I will favor liftoff sooner  - 12 - than I now anticipate."
 A major consideration will be my judgment about w hether inflation expectations are at risk of becoming “unanchored” —rising substantially and persistently  above 2 percent .
