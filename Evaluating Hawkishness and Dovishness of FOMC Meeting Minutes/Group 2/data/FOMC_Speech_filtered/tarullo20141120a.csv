" The canonical case is that of maturity transformation by a  very conventional bank, which takes demand deposits and uses the funds to make loans that are repaid only over time."
" Should an unusual number of depositors want to withdraw their funds, for whatever reason, the bank may not have sufficient cash on hand t o meet those demands."
" If depositors other than those initially seeking to withdraw funds hear that the bank may have difficulty meeting the demand, they may be motivated to join the withdrawal line before the bank runs out of cash entirely  or, even worse, becomes insolvent ."
 The latter gives the bank access to short -term liquidity in order to meet the demands of depositors who have  an immediate need for cash.
 The key question is how to balance the important  role these markets have come to play in funding economic activity with the need to contain the destabilizing risks of runs in these same markets.
" Firms  would have to demonstrate that  they either  maintain ed more or less  matched durations of their  assets and liabilities in the steady state or, what in some circumstances could amount to much the same thing, have  liquidity buffers sufficient to meet all liquidity demands  even during a systemic event following a major shock to asset values ."
" First, such a requirement would significantly constrain the level of liquidity and maturity transformation  in normal times , surely resulting in significant constraints on credit extension , with consequent negative effects on economic growth."
"                                                    - 6 -  Demand deposits and other short -term bank liabilities are safe, easy -tovalue claims that are well  suited for transaction purposes and provide money -like benefits to firms and households .5    Second, in a world without LOLR, shortages of liquid assets would be exacerbated during stress episodes ."
" Knowing they must rely only on their own liquidity to meet demands even as market uncertainty is increasing and asset values suffer downward pressure, banks w ould have to reduce dramatically their core intermediation function."
" Indeed, it is for this reason that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA) placed restrictions on discount window lending by the Federal Reserve to underc apitalized banks .8  Thus, while liquidity regulation should not require self -insurance against low probability, severe systemic events, it has an important role to play alongside capital regulation and resolution mechanisms in reducing the likelihood of sy stemic events and making them more 8 A central bank can also increase liquidity in the financial system by reducing its target interest rate, at least until it reaches the zero lower bound."
" Again, though, the potential costs of reliance on interest rate reductions --including risks of undesirably high inflation, excessive leverage leading to financial st ability concerns, or both --argue for a regime of wellconsidered liquidity regulations."
 The upshot would be to exacerbate systemic strains  and cause a reduction in economic activity .
" That is, a firm that falls out of compliance with the LCR or NSFR during a period of generaliz ed stress should not  be subject to automatic 18 Although, in recent decades, reserve requirements have been used to establish a stable demand for reserves for monetary policy implementation purposes, they were a form of liquidity requirement historically."
"  During normal times, short -term wholesale funding can help to satisfy investor demand for saf e and liquid inves tments, lower  funding c osts for borrowers, and support  the functioning of important markets, including those in which monetary policy is executed."
