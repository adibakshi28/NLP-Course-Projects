"Yellen  Vice Chair  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System  at  “A TransAtlantic Agenda for Shared Prosperity”   A Conference Sponsored by the AFLCIO, Friedrich Ebert Stiftung,  and the IMK Macroeconomic Policy Institute  Washington, D.C.     February 11, 2013   Thank you for the opportunity to speak to  you today about the Federal Reserve’s efforts to strengthen the recovery and pursu e a goal that it shares with the labor movement:  maximum employment.1 As an objective of public policy, maximu m employment doesn’t appear in the U.S. Constitution, in any presidential decree,  or even in the mission statement of the Labor Department."
" A law passed in 1946 made it a general goal for the U.S. government, but so far the Federal Reserve is the only agency assigned the job of pursuing maximum employment."
 I do so because the gulf between maximum employment and the very difficult conditions workers face today helps explain the urgency behind the Federal Reserve’s ongoing efforts to strengthen the recovery.
" In response, we have taken, and are continui ng to take, forceful action to increase the pace of economic growth and job creation."
"      In the three years after th e Great Recession ended, growth  in real gross domestic product (GDP) averaged only 2.2 percent per year."
"2 The law calls on the Federal Reserve to “promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate longterm interest rates.”  Se e section 2A of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. § 225a as added by act of Nov."
" The bursting of  an unprecedented housing bubble, together with the financial crisis that followed, dea lt a huge blow to demand."
 4 The results in the figure are derived from a model th at relates GDP growth in recoveries to recession depth and duration.
   Exhibit 2 shows how employment has decl ined and recovered following several previous recessions.
" The employment measur e attempts to control for the fact that demographic changes and other factors have altered the trend, or  potential, workforce over the years."
" For example, in the 1970s, the pool of potential workers was expanding as baby boomers and an increasing share of wo men moved into the labor force, such that employment needed to rise relatively quickly  just to absorb these additional workers."
" More recently, the aging of the population has put downward pressure on labor force participation, so employment hasn’t had to  grow as quickly to keep pace with the potential workforce."
" Even after making this adjustment, howev er, the Great Recession stands out both for the magnitude of the job losses that attended the downtur n and for the weak recovery in employment that occurred after the recession ended."
" By this I don’t mean everythi ng that contributes to economic growth, but rather those things that typi cally play a key role when the U.S. economy is recovering from recession."
" Government spending on unemployment benefits and other safetynet  programs rises in recessions, helping individuals hurt by the downturn and also supporting consumer spe nding and the broader economy by replacing lost income."
" These automatic  declines in tax collections and increases in government spending are often supplemented with discretiona ry fiscal action--tax rate cuts, spending on infrastructure and other goods and servic es, and extended unemployment benefits."
 These discretionary fiscal policy actions are ty pically a plus for growth in the years just after a recession.
" For example, following the severe 198182 recession, discretionary fiscal policy contributed an av erage of about 1 percentage point per year to real GDP growth over the subsequent three years.5  However, discretionary fisc al policy hasn’t been much  of a tailwind during this recovery."
" In the year following the end of the recession, discretionary fiscal policy at the federal, state, and local levels boosted growth at roughly the same pace as in past recoveries, as exhibit 3 indicates."
" But inst ead of contributing to growth thereafter, discretionary fiscal policy this time has actually  acted to restrain the recovery."
" At the federal level, policymakers have                                                        5 These calculations are based on Federal Reserve Boar d estimates of fiscal impetus, which measures the boost to aggregate demand from increased government purchases as well as the effects of changes in tax and entitlement policies on consumer and business spending."
" - 5 -     reduced purchases of goods and services, allo wed stimulusrelated spending to decline, and have put in place further policy actions to  reduce deficits."
" While a longterm plan is needed to reduce deficits a nd slow the growth of federa l debt, the tax increases and spending cuts that would have occurred last  month, absent action by the Congress and the President, likely would have been a headwi nd strong enough to blow the United States back into recession."
" Before the Great Recession, housing investment added an average of 1/2 percentage  point to real GDP growth in the two years after each of the previous four recessions, considerably more than its contribution to growth at other times.6     During this recovery, in  contrast, residential invest ment, on net, has contributed very little to growth since the recession ended."
" I’m encouraged by recent improvement in the residential sector, but the contribution of housing investment to overa ll economic activity remains considerably below the average seen in past recoveries, as exhibit 4 shows."
" Even during recessions, households’ expectations fo r income growth tend to be reasonably stable, which provides support for overall spending."
" In the most recent recession, however, surveys suggest that consumers sharpl y revised down their prospects for future income growth and have only partially ad justed up their expectations since then (exhibit 5)."
 The fiscal and financial crisis in Europe has resulted in a euroarea recession and contributed to slower global growth.
 Europe’s difficulties have blunt ed what had been strong growth in U.S. exports earlier in the recovery by sapping demand worldwide.
"  Let me say a few words now, and more later,  about the role of monetary policy in this recovery."
" Reducing the federal funds ra te tends to reduce other interest rates and boost asset prices, thus encouraging spendi ng and investment throughout the economy."
 The other unconventional tool is known as forward gui dance--providing information about the future path of shortterm interest rates anticipated by the Committee.
" I believe that the Federal Reserve’s asset purchases and other unconventional policy actions have helped, and are continui ng to help, fill this gap and thus shore up aggregate demand."
" In addition, pronounced uncertainty about ec onomic conditions has weighed on capital spending decisions and may have blunted the normal effect of lo wer interest rates on business investment."
"Bernanke (2012), “Monetary Policy since the Onset of the Crisis,” speech delivered at “The Changing Policy Landscape,” a symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, held in Jackson Hole, Wyo., August 30September 1,  www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20120831a.htm."
   The unemployment rate now stands at 7.9 percent.
" To put this number in perspective, while that’s a big improvement from the 10 percent reached in late 2009, it is now higher than unemployment ever got in the 24 years before the Great Recession."
 A broader measure of underemployment that includes th ese and other potential worker s stands at 14.4 percent.
" Compared with the 7.9 percent unemployment rate for all workers, the unemployment rate for African Americans is 13.8 percent."
" The unemployment rate                                                        9 Mean annual poverty rate for all people, U.S. Bureau of the Census."
" For young people--workers 16 to 19 years old--the unemployment rate is 23.4 perc ent, little changed from the end of the recession."
" At its worst point in th e 1980s, the median length of unemployment for those looking for a job was 12  weeks, but the median since the Great Recession has averaged 20 weeks and now stands at 16 weeks."
 We know that longterm unemployment is devastating to workers and thei r families.
 Longer spells of  unemployment raise the risk of homelessness and have been a factor cont ributing to the foreclosure crisis.
" The toll is simply terrible on the mental and physical health of workers,  on their marriages, and on their children.10  Longterm unemployment is also a great concern because it has the potential to itself become a headwind restraining the economy."
"Davis and Till Von Wachter (2 011), “Recessions and the Costs of Job Loss,” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity,  Fall, pp."
" Longterm unemployment can make any worker progressively less employable, even after the economy strengthens."
" A factor contributing to the high level of longterm unemployment in the current recovery is the relatively large proportion of  workers who have permanently lost their previous jobs, as opposed to being laid off te mporarily."
 Construction employment fell from its peak of 7.7 million in 2006 to a low of 5.4 million in 2011.
" In general, individuals who permanently lo se their previous jobs take longer to become reemployed than do those on temporary layoff, are more likely to have to change industries or occupations to find a new job, a nd earn significantly less when they become reemployed.11   The greater amount of permanent job lo ss seen in the recent recession also suggests that there might have been an incr ease in the degree of mismatch between the skills possessed by the unemployed and those demanded by employers."
 This possibility and the unprecedented level and persistence of longterm unemployment in this recovery have prompted some to ask whether a si gnificant share of une mployment since the recession is due to structural  problems in labor markets and not simply a cyclical                                                         11 See Louis S.
- 12 -     shortfall in aggregate demand.
" This question is important for anyone committed to the goal of maximum employment, because it imp licitly asks whether the best we can hope for, even in a healthy economy, is an unemp loyment rate significantly higher than what has been achieved in the past."
"For the Federal Reserve, th e answer to this question has important implications for monetary policy."
" If the current, elevated  rate of unemployment is largely cyclical, then the straightforward solution is to ta ke action to raise aggregate demand."
" If unemployment is instead substantially struct ural, some worry that attempts to raise aggregate demand will have little effect on unemployment and serve only to stoke inflation."
" However, I see the evidence as consistent with the view that the increase in unemployment since the onset of the Great Recession has been largely cyclical and not structural."
"- 13 -     large--hardly surprising gi ven the collapse in these sectors in 2008 and 2009--but manufacturing and other cyclically sensitiv e industries were hit hard as well, and employment in these industries has likewise  recovered slowly."
" Moreover, if skills mismatch in the labor market has led to an excess supply of worker s in some sectors and a shortage of workers in ot hers, then we would expect to see an atypical amount of variation in the balance between job openi ngs and unemployment ac ross sectors."
" But work by Jesse Rothstein fails  to uncover evidence of such a pattern.14  This and related research suggests to me , first, that a broadbased cyclical shortage of demand is the main cause of  today’s elevated unemployment rate, and, second, that whatever problems there may be  today with labor market functioning are likely to be substantially resolved as th e broader economy improves and bolsters the demand for labor."
"Violante (2012), “Mismatch Unemployment,” NBER Working Paper Series  18265 (Cambridge, Mass.:  National Bureau of Economic Research, August)."
" But making this transition will be much easier in a healthy economy, which is one reason why I am encouraged by th e evidence that elevated unemployment is indeed largely cyclical."
 I will now describe what the Federal Reserve is doing to try to raise demand and create jobs.
" The first is largescale a sset purchases, intended to lo wer longterm interest rates to encourage borrowing for spending and investment."
" Unlike its past purchase programs, which were fixed in size, this time the FOMC stated its determination to con tinue the program, provi ded that inflation remains well contained, until it judges that ther e has been a substantial improvement in - 15 -     the outlook for the labor market."
"   The second unconventional policy tool th at the FOMC has used is forward guidance, in the form of moreexplicit and moredetailed information about the future path of monetary policy."
" The longerterm interest rates that mo st profoundly influence housing demand, capital spending, and asset prices depend on current and expected future levels of shortterm interest rates, su ch as the federal funds rate that has been the Fed’s conventional monetary policy tool."
" Signa ling the future path of the federal funds rate can therefore directly affect interest rates today on auto loans, home mortgages, and bonds issued by companies and state and local governments, even when the current level of the federal funds ra te cannot be lowered."
"- 16 -     A disadvantage of this calendarbased a pproach was that it might not be clear whether changes in the date reflect cha nges in the FOMC’s outlook for growth, for inflation, or a shift in the desired stan ce of policy."
" Specifically, it stated that nearzero rate s would likely remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and “at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 61/2 per cent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee’s 2 percent longerrun goal, and l ongerterm inflation expectati ons continue to be well anchored.”17  It deserves emphasis that a 61/2 percent unemployment rate and inflation one to two years ahead that is 1/2 percentage poi nt above the Committee’s 2 percent objective are thresholds for possible  action, not triggers that will necessarily prompt an immediate increase in the FOMC’s target rate."
" In pr actical terms, it means that the Committee does not expect to raise the federal funds ra te as long as unemployment remains above 61/2 percent and inflation one to two years ahead is projected to be less than 1/2 percentage point above its 2 percent objec tive."
" With respec t to maximum employment, most FOMC                                                        17 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2012), “FOMC Stat ement,” press release, December 12, www.federalreserve.gov/new sevents/press/moneta ry/20121212a.htm."
"- 17 -     participants continue to estimate that the longerrun normal unemployment rate lies in a range of 5.2 to 6 percent, and the Committee co ntinues to believe an inflation rate of 2 percent (as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures) is most consistent with the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate."
" Importantly, these quantitative goals are neith er ceilings nor floors for inflation and unemployment, and the Committee will take a balanced approach to returning both measures to their objectives over time."
" With employment so far from its maximum level and with inflation currently running, and expected to continue to run, at  or below the Committee’s 2 percent longerterm objective, it is entirely appropriate fo r progress in attaining maximum employment to take center stage in determin ing the Committee’s policy stance."
" While the Committee’s longerterm goals remain unchanged, what has changed is that the FOMC is now providing more info rmation about how it expects to pursue its inflation and employment goals."
" In partic ular, we will employ our policy tools, as appropriate, to raise aggregate demand and em ployment in the context of continued price stability, consistent with our balanced appro ach."
" That’s good news for workers, because I believe that these steps will increase de mand, and more demand means more jobs."
"                                                         18 The FOMC’s Statement on LongerRun Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, as amended effective on January 29, 2013, is available on the Board’s website at www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/long errun-goalsand-policystrategy-20130130.pdf."
- 18 -     It will be a long road back to a healthy job market.
 The job market is improving.
