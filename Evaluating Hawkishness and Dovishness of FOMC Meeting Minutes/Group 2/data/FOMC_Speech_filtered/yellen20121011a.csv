" The recovery from the global recession of emerging market economie s, especially in Asia, has been more robust, but even these economies are slow ing in the face of weak global demand, and they would benefit from further progress towa rd a more balanced model of growth led by domestic demand."
"This research finds that for the advan ced economies--especially Europe and the United States--the growth in output has been somewhat weaker than past history would have suggested, even accounting for the dept h and duration of the last downturn."
" Although monetary policy has been highl y accommodative, the pace of fiscal consolidation in Europe and the United States  has been much greater  during this recovery than is typical following seve re recessions."
" In the United States, spillovers from Europe and a stilldepressed housing market also help account for our tepid recovery and elevated unemployment."
"  The Role of Emerging Asia   In contrast to the advanced economies,  emerging market economies, particularly in Asia, recovered sharply from the global downturn, in part by using countercyclical fiscal and monetary policies to bolster  domestic demand."
" Exports to China from other countries in the region have also  weakened, partly because of the unwinding of China’s earlier stimulus programs, but al so because China’s exports to the advanced economies have slowed, thus lowering its demand for imported parts and components."
" For the moment, emerging Asia is offsetting weakness in external demand through accommodative monetary and fiscal policies."
" But ultimately, it would be desirable, both for the region and for the global economy, if  emerging Asia were able to rely less on temporary policy stimulus and more on a f undamental rebalancing of growth toward domestic demand."
  Greater reliance on domestic demand would not only help shield Asia’s economic growth from the weakness in the advanced economies; it would also boost the wellbeing of its citizens by enabling them to consume a greater share of the output they produce.
" Moreover, transforming emerging Asia into an independent engine of global growth would put the global economy on a much surer footing, thus helping to achieve the Group of Twenty nations’ commitment to strong, sustainable, and balanced growth."
" Like other Asian economies, Japan shares a history of current account surpluses and exportdependent growth."
" Like its neighbors, Japan will need to look for alternative engines of growth."
" Japanese  government spending helped propel the economy’s bounceback from recession, but it has also added to public debt, which the International Monetary Fund now projects w ill rise to 237 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) this year, the larges t among the major advanced economies.2  Along with this high debt, aging of the population and sl ow GDP growth pose important concerns for fiscal sustainability."
"To date, the savings of Japanese household and firms have been more than enough to finance the government deficit; ind eed, interest rates on government debt have                                                  2 See International Monetary Fund (2012), “Taking Stock:  A Progress Report on Fiscal Adjustment,” World Economic and Financial Surveys, Fiscal Monitor,  Table 3:  General Government Debt, 200813, p."
" Accordingly, Japa n, like the United States, has the scope to carry out fiscal conso lidation plans that address longr un sustainability issues without endangering nearterm growth prospects."
" Cu rrently, policymakers in  both Japan and the United States face the challenge of designing po licies that provide a credible commitment to mediumterm deficit reduction without disr upting the fragile recovery."
"  Japan would also benefit from measures to  increase its potential growth, which is generally estimated to have fallen to less th an 1 percent and could decline further as population aging progresses."
" It is widely believed that easi ng regulations could promote faster productivity growth, particularly in the services sector."
" Higher employment and faster producti vity gains would help to boost economic activity, enhance fiscal sustainability, and rest ore Japan’s contributions to gl obal economic growth."
    Conclusion Growth in the advanced economies is st ill hampered by crit ical challenges and full recovery is likely to take  several years.
" Emerging mark et economies, particularly in Asia, have performed better, but both they and the global economy more generally would benefit by further rebalancing of their grow th toward domestic demand."
" Japan initially bounced back more quickly than other a dvanced economies from the global financial crisis, but its growth has slowed recently, and it also faces serious fiscal and structural challenges."
