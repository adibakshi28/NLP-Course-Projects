"For release on delivery 12:20 a.m. EDT (1:20 p.m. JST) October 14, 2012         U.S. Monetary Policy and In ternational Implications    Remarks by  Ben S."
" Accordingl y, the pace of economic growth has been insufficient to support significant improve ment in the job market; indeed, the unemployment rate, at 7.8 percen t, is well above what we judge to be its longrun normal level."
" Consumer price inflation is running somewhat below the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent longerrun objective, and surveyand mark etbased measures of longerterm inflation expectations have remained well anchored."
" Japan’s economy is recovering from last year’s tragic earthquake  and tsunami, and it continues to struggle with deflation and persistent weak demand."
" And in the emerging market economies, the  - 2 -rapid snapback from the global financial cris is has given way to slower growth in the face of weak export demand from the advanced economies."
" Looking ahead, economic projections of  Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) participants prepared for the Co mmittee’s September meeting called for the economic recovery to proceed at a modera te pace in coming quarters, with the unemployment rate declining only gradually."
 FO MC participants gene rally expected that inflation was likely to run at  or below the Committee’s infl ation goal of 2 percent over the next few years.
" The Committee also j udged that there were  significant downside risks to this outlook, importantly  including the potentia l for an intensification of strains in Europe and an associated sl owing in global growth."
  Federal Reserve’s Recent Policy Actions  All of the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy decisions are guided by our dual mandate to promote maximum employment a nd stable prices.
" With the disappointing progress in job markets and with inflation pressures re maining subdued, the FOMC has taken several important steps this year to  provide additional policy accommodation."
" Moreover, the Committee clarified that it expects to maintain a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy for a considerable peri od after the economic recovery strengthens."
 An easing in financial conditions and greater public confidence should help promot e more rapid economic growth and faster job gains over coming quarters.
" Although we expect our policies to provide meaningful  help to the economy, the most effective approach would combine a range of economic policies and tackle longerterm fiscal and  - 4 -structural issues as well as the nearterm shortfall in aggregate demand."
" These capital flows are said  to cause undesirable currency appreciation, too much  liquidity leading to asse t bubbles or inflation, or economic disruptions as capital inflows qui ckly give way to outflows."
" And, to be sure , highly accommodative monetary policies in the United States, as well as in ot her advanced economies, shift interest rate differentials in favor of emerging markets a nd thus probably contribut e to private capital flows to these markets."
" Even in normal times, differences in growth prospects among countries--and the result ing differences in expected returns--are the most important determinant of capita l flows."
" In some emerging markets, policymakers have chosen to systematically resist currency apprecia tion as a means of promoting exports and domestic growth."
" However, the perceived be nefits of currency management inevitably come with costs, including reduced mone tary independence and the consequent susceptibility to imported inflation."
" Under a flexible excha ngerate regime, a fully independent monetary policy, together with fiscal policy as neede d, would be available to help counteract any adverse effects of currency appreciation on growth."
" The resultant rebalancing from external to domestic demand would not only preserve nearterm growth in the emerging market economies while supporting recovery  in the advanced economies, it would redound to everyone’s benefit in the long r un by putting the global economy on a more stable and sustainable path."
" The slowing of growth in the emerging market economies this year in large part reflects their decelerating exports to the United States, Europe, and other advanced economies."
" Therefore, monetary easing that  supports the recovery in the advanced economies should stimulate trade and boost growth in emerging market economies as well."
" In principle, depreciation of the dollar a nd other advancedeconomy cu rrencies could reduce (although not eliminate) the positive effect on trade a nd growth in emerging markets."
"    - 7 -Conclusion   To conclude, the Federal Reserve is providing additional monetary accommodation to achieve its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability."
"economic recovery, but by boosting U.S. spending and growth, it has the effect of he lping support the global economy as well."
 Assessments of the international impact of U.S. monetary po licies should give appropriate weight to thei r beneficial effects on gl obal growth and stability.
