"Stein   Member   Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at the  International Research Forum on Monetary Policy  Sponsored by the European Central Bank, the Federal Reserve Board, the Center for Financial Studies at the Goethe University, and the Georgetown Center for  Economic Research at Georgetown University   Washington, D.C.        March 21, 2014    I woul d like to talk today about how one might explicitly incorporate financial  stability considerations into a monetary  policy framework.1  Doing so involves tackling two questions --one that is relatively easy and one that is much harder."
" To be specific , are there cases in which one might tolerate a larger forecast shortfall of the pa th of the unemployment rate from its fullemployment level than one would otherwise, because of  a concern that a more accommodative policy might entail a heightened risk of some sort of adverse financial  market outcome?"
" What sorts of data should one look to, and what sorts of empirical methods should one use, to calibrate by how much the stance of monetary policy should be altered relative to the case in which financial  stability considerations are completely set aside?"
" I am going to try to make the case that , all else being equal, monetary policy should be less accommodative-- by which I mean that it should be willing to tolerate a larger for ecast shortfall of the path of the unemployment rate from its fullemployment level--when estimates of risk premiums in the bond market are abnormally low."
  - 3 - Do Financial  Stability Considerations Belong in a Monetary Policy Framework?
" First, suppose that the Federal Reserve fo cuses only on its traditional dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability."
" To keep things simple, suppose further that these two goals are not  in conflict with one another --say , because aggregate demand is weak, depressing both employment and i nflation --so that we can boil things down to one objective :  keeping unemployment close to target."
" A little bit of algebra shows that this objective function can in turn be decomposed into two pieces:  ( 1) an “expected shortfall” term, given by the squared deviation of expected unemployment from the target level of U*; and ( 2) a “risk” term, given by  the variance of realized unemployment , U.5 Second, the argument assumes that there is some variable summarizing financial  market vulnerability --I will be abstract for the moment and just call it FMV --which is influenced by monetary policy."
" That is, easie r monetary policy leads to increased vulnerability as measured by FMV."
" Moreover, when FMV is elevated, there is a greater probability of an adverse event --some kind of financial  market  shock --that, if it were to occur, would push up the unemployment rate, all else being equal .6                                                     5 Kocherlakota (2014) emphasizes the same decomposition of the Federal Reserve’s loss function."
"6 If I had introduced an explicit time dimension, it might be more natural to assume that easier monetary policy today raises the probability of an adverse ev ent at some medium -run future  date, even while reducing the probability in the short run."
" These imperfections could stem from regulatory arbitrage ; politicaleconomy constraints ; or the fact that too much regula tion can also impede economic growth, just like overly  restrictive monetary policy.7  Thus one way to think of my construct of FMV is that it is a stand -in for the level of financial vulnerabilities that remain after regulation has done the best that it ca n do, given the existing real -world limitations."
" In this setting, even with inflation concerns entirely set aside, monetary policy faces a tradeoff."
 Consider a situation in which unemployment is above target.
 A more  accommodative policy has the usual benefit of lowering expected unemployment and thus reducing the expected shortfall term in the objective function.
" If, however, it also raises the conditional variance of the unemployment rate via an elevated -FMV channel --thereby increasing the risk term in the objective function--then there is a cost to be weighed alongside the benefit."
" And importantly, this is true even when financial stability is not a separate objective in and of itself; as I have framed it, financial stability matters only insofar as it  affects the degree of  risk around the employment leg of the Fed eral Reserve’s mandate.8  To be sure, absent a concrete measure of FMV, as well as some sense of the responsiveness of FMV to monetary policy, this discussion i s all pretty theoretical and                                                                                                                                                  tradeoffs to be considered, particularly if the economy were in a very vulnerable position today."
" In making the tradeoff I just described, the margina l benefit of using easier policy to reduce the expected unemployment gap is greater when the gap itself is large --that is, when unemployment is far above target."
" In this case, even a quite high level of financial vulnerability may not imply a much differe nt stance of monetary policy than would fall out of a more traditional analysis."
" However, as the unemployment gap shrinks, financial  stability risks loom larger in relative terms, so an analysis that takes them on board may lead to more of an adjustment i n the stance of policy."
" When it gets down to implementation, Woodford suggests that the most natural measure of financial  market vulnerability is a variable that captures “leverage in the financial sector.”  In other words, faced with unemployment above target, he would have monetary policy be less accommodative, all else being equal, when financial -sector leverage is high."
" Second, easy monetary policy is asserted to increase the incentives for the financial sector to lever up."
" More to the point, recall that , for the purposes of informing monetary policy, one wants to focus on those sources of financial vulnerability that are least effectively dealt with via regulation."
" In other words, if we were to see signs that banks’ capital ratios were in danger of eroding, we would certainly want to do something, but it is ha rd for me to imagine that the something should involve monetary policy --the obvious first line of defense in this case would be to turn to our regulatory and supervisory tools."
"”  - 7 - In response  to this critique, one might instead seek to focus the attention of  monetary policymakers on broader measures of private -sector leverage that are outside the reach of traditional financial regulation."
" For example, Borio and Drehmann document that the ratio of credit to the private nonfinancial sector relative to gross domestic product ( GDP ), once suitably detrended, has substantial predictive power for financial crises, so perhaps it might make sense for monetary policy to condition on this kind of broad credit -toGDP ratio.10  However, if one goes this route, another meas urement challenge arises:  How, if at all, does monetary policy influence the evolution of the ratio?"
" In particular, the implications for monetary policy that I have in mind do not seem to depend critically on the difficult question of why there is so much time  variation in expected bond market returns; they only require that this var iation exists, as we know it does."
 The next observation to throw into the mix is that monetary policy is one of the factors that have an important influence on these movements.
" A n emerging bod y of empirical work finds  that an easing of monetary policy --even  via conventional policy tools in normal times --tend s to reduce both the term prem iums on long -term Treasury securities  and the credit spreads on corporate bonds.17  That is, monetary policy always tends to work in part through its effe ct on capital  market risk premiu ms, perhaps through a  risktaking or reaching -foryield mechanism.18   However,  while this empirical observation sheds some interesting light on how monetary policy influences the real economy, it does not by itself suggest that there is any fina ncial  stability dark side --that is , any meaningful increase in what I have been calling FMV --to the lowered risk premiums that g o with monetary accommodation."
" For there to be such a dark side , there would have to be some sort of asymmetry in the unwinding  of the  effects of monetary policy on these  risk premiums, whereby the eventual reversal either happens more abruptly, or causes larger economic effects, than the initial compression."
" Suppose that initially, the credit  risk premiu m on high -yield bonds is 400 basis points, and that, because the unemployment rate is well above                                                                                                                                                  my intuition is that the source of variation may matter quite a bit."
" For example, I would conjecture that it might be more normatively appropriate, holding fixed the consequences for aggregate activity and unemployment, to lean against a sharp reduction in risk premiums that is driven by investor sentiment rather than against one that is driven by a rational response to changes in the risk environment."
"18 Note that,  as an econometric matter, it is easier to establish a causal effe ct of monetary policy on risk premiums than on broad measures of leverage, because asset prices can be measured on a daily or  even intraday basis."
" A similar identification stra tegy is not available for linking monetary policy changes to movements in,  say, nonfinancial -sector leverage, given that the latter is measured infrequently."
" To do so, I build directly on recent work by Gilchrist and Zakrajsek ( hereafter , GZ).19  GZ show that changes in credit  risk premiums have substantial predictive power for measures of economic activity like GDP and unemployment."
" Moreover, in simple forec asting regressions, changes in the EBP are associated with significant movements in GDP and unemployment one year later."
  - 12 - of the nondefault -related component of credit spreads --portends a decline  in economic activity and employment a year later.
" The coefficient estimates imply that a n increase of  50 basis  point s in the EBP  in a single  quarter , which is roughly a once -every -fiveyears kind of move, is associated with a two  percentage point slowing of  GDP growth over t he next four quarters and slightly more than a one percentage point increas e in the unemployment rate over the same interv al.20  These effects are, by any standard, economically important."
" By contrast, declines in the EBP have no discerni ble effect at all on economic activity."
" Nevertheless, the evidence suggests that even more modest capital  market disruptions may have consequences that are large enough to warrant consideration when formulating monetary policy."
" If so, the indicated directional adjustment would be to be less aggressive in providing  monetary accommodation in the face of above -target unemployment, all else being equal, when risk premiums are abnormally low."
 Foremost among them  is the fact that the ability of inc reases in the EBP to predict future economic activity may not reflect a causal link from the former to the latter.
" If so, it would be wrong to conclude that easy monetary policy --even if it does , in fact , cause lower risk premiums --has any causal effect on the probability of a future s lowdown."
  Making progress on these difficult issues of causality will likely require a clearer articulation of the underlying mechanism that leads to such pronounce d asymmetries in the relationship between credit spreads and economic activity.
" Alternatively, a similar mech anism may play out with openend bond funds, whereby losses cause large outflows of assets under  management, again compromising the intermediation function and aggregate credit supply.21     Conclusion  To restate my main point, I believe that measures of bond market risk premiums --for example, estimates of the expected excess returns on long -term Treasury securities relative to T reasury bills and on credit -risky bonds relative to Treasur y securities --may turn out to be useful inputs into the monetary policy framework."
" At the same time, canonical macro models in the N ew Keynesian genre of the sort that are often used to inform monetary policy tend to                                                  21 Basset and others  (2014) document that changes in the EBP are associated with significant changes in bank lending standards , which suggest s a broade r pullback in the credit intermediation process ."
" - 15 - exhibit little or no meaningful risk  premium variation.22  Even if most of the specifics of what I have had to say in this talk turn out to be off base, I have to believe that our macro models will ultimately be more useful as a guide to policy if they build on a more empirically  realistic foundation with respect to the behavior of  interest rates and credit spreads."
