" It is a pleasure to join you to take part in today’s conversations.1  When we started Fed  Listens back in 2019, the initiative was part of a broad, comprehensive review of the decisionmaking framework we use to pursue our monetary policy goals of maximum employment and price stability."
" We met with people across the country from a wide range of backgrounds and perspectives, and we learned a lot about how our monetary policy actions affect them, their businesses, and their communities."
 These discussions help us gain a deeper understanding of the ongoing burden from high inflation—from the considerations for families  in mak ing spending decisions to  the factors weighed by business owners in  apply ing for loan s to make capital investments like  new buildings or equipment to expand operations.
" Inflation has come down, but w e know that it  is still  too high, and it can be especially difficult for those least able to manage the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation."
 My colleagues and I are highly focused on returning inflation to  2 percent.
" For example, the strong sales of computers, televisions, and video game consoles this year might reflect some ongoing pentup demand following earlier supply shortages, or they might reflect a more permanent change in preferences for these goods due to the greater amount of time many of us are spending at home."
