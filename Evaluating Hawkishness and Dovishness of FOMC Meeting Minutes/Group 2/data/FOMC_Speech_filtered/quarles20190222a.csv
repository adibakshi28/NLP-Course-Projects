"Quarles   Vice Chairman for Supervision   Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at the   2019 U.S. Monetary Policy Forum , sponsored by the Initiative on Global Markets at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business   New York, New York         February 22, 2019   When I was asked to participate on this panel in the middle of last year, the prevailing metaphor regarding Federal Reserve balance sheet policy was “as boring as watching paint dry.”  Well , times have changed, and I commend the conference organizers for their foresight."
" The Federal Reserve controls the level of the federal funds rate and other short -term interest rate s primarily through the use of administered rates, including the rate paid on reserve  balances and the offered rate on overnight reverse repurchase agreements."
" 2 For more information, s ee the Committee’s Statement Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation and Balance Sh eet Normalization, which is available on the Board’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20190130c.htm ."
It has supported the achievement of our dual -mandate objectives of maximum employment and price stability.
" And it has shown itself to be flexible and w ell suited to maintaining interest rate control through various changes in money markets, bank regulation, and the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet."
" Since the FOMC began lifting interest rates  in December 2015, money market rates have generally moved close ly with the federal funds rate, which in turn has followed changes in administered rates."
" In line with the requirements of operating with ample reserves--and boosted by the growth in nonreserve liabilities --the Fed will maintain a larger balance sheet and reserve supply relative to the pre -crisis per iod, with the goal of remaining on the flat portion of the reserve demand curve ."
" In our statement on Policy Normalization Principles and Plans, we outlined an intention to hold no more securities than ne cessary to implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively.3  As the balance sheet continues to shrink, we are now in the process of determining that necessary size."
"                                                   3 The Committee’s Policy Normalization Principles and Plans were adopted on September 16, 2014, and can be found on the Board’s website at  - 3 - Ultimately, the size of the balance sheet will be determined by a number of factor s, including demand for nonreserve liabilities, such as currency (which has been rising ), and, importantly, the quantity of reserves necessary to remain reliably on the flat portion of the reserve demand curve ."
 Survey results suggest that banks have great ly increased their demand for reserves in the post -crisis period.
" Responses to the September 2018 Senior Financial Officer Survey report that banks would be comfortable with a level of reserves in the system in the neighborhood of $800 billion, taking int o consideration the level of interest rates at the time.4  In part, this increased demand reflects a response to regulatory changes introduced after the crisis."
"     Notwithstanding survey results, the level of reserve demand remains quite uncertain."
" It is possible that , over time , the preferences of banks will shift, or that demand will prove more pri ce elastic than banks a re currently expecting."
"  - 4 - on the federal funds rate .5  That said, even if uncertain, it is probably safe to say that reserve demand is much higher than before  the crisis."
" In that case, there would likely be occasions when unexpected declines in the supply of reserves or increases in the demand for reserves would require an open market operation to offset  temporary upward pressures on the federal funds rate."
" Alternatively, we could operate with an average supply of reserves large enough to keep the federal funds rate determined along the flat portion of the reserve demand curve even with an unexpected shi ft in the supply of or demand for reserves."
" With so much uncertainty over the level and slope of the reserve demand  curve , a degree of caution is warranted."
"Quarles (2018) , “Liquidity Regulation and the Size of the Fed’s Balance Sheet ,” speech delivered at “Currencies, Capital, and Central Bank Balances:  A Policy Conference,” a Hoover Insti tution Monetary Policy Conference, Stanford University, Stanford , Calif ., May 4, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/quarles20180504a.htm ."
" Even as the total size of the balance sheet remains fixed, the composition of the liabilities would gradually change, in part as demand for currency grows in line with the economy."
" This plan would substantially reduce the pace of the decline in reserves, allowing us to gradually approach our assessment of the appropriate amount of reserves for the efficient and effective imple mentation of monetary policy."
" Of course, in the longer run, once we reach our preferred level of reserves, the balance sheet would have to resume growth to match a continued increase  in demand for nonreserve liabilities."
" In regard to duration, moving to shorten the duration of our holdings could increase the  Fed’s ability to affect long -term interest rates if the need arose."
"     Finally, i n assessing our balance sheet policy , it is important to p oint out  that the Fed remains entirely focused on meeting its statutory dual -mandate objectives of maximum employment and price stability."
