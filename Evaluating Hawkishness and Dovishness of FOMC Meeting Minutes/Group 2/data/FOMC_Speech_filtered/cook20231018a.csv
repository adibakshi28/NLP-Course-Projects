"  For release on delivery  6:55 p.m. EDT   October 18, 2023         The Evolution of the Federal Reserve’s Employment Mandate     Remarks by   Lisa D."
" The first reason is that this is a story about how the Federal Reserve, where I am a policymaker , came to be the first central bank in the world t o make maximum employment a primary and explicit goal , coequal with its goal of price stability ."
"   - 2 -  experience, as a Spelman College undergraduate, to hear some details about the lobbying for full employment and other economic policy objectives by one of the leaders of that movement ."
" It is generally agreed t hat the legal roots  of the Fed’s employment mandate are in the Employment Act of 1946, itself inspired by a 1944 speech by President Franklin Roosevelt.3  The law require d all of the federal government to “ promote  maximum employment, production,  and purchasing power.”4  Alongside the preservation of  “purchasing power,”  even then, the employment goal was linked to inflation."
 Federal Reserve Chairs cited the Employment Act as applying to monetary policy.5  But it was rare for the Federal Reserve to refer to thi s statutory mandate when explaining monetary  policy decisions .
" For example, the Federal Reserve Board’s annual report  for 1975 noted that in public statements on monetary policy given during the year by the Federal Reserve Chair , he had pointed to the “the very high rates of unemployment and of idle industrial capacity then prevailing” as a factor bearing on the Federal Open Market Committee’s  3 The act, which Congress passed in 1945, was inspired by Franklin Roosevelt’s 1944 State of the Union message, which proposed a “Second Bill of Rights” or “Economic Bill of Rights.”  FDR said , “We have come to a clear realization of the fact that true individual freedom cannot exist with out economic security and independence.”  His list of rights included “the right to a useful and remunerative job,” echoed by the Employment Act’s recognition of “t he right to a useful and remunerative job in the industries or shops or farms or mines of th e nation .”  The full 1944 State of the Union message is available on the Franklin D."

Maisel concluding that the Federal Open  Market Committee was required to consider the goals of the Employment Act.

  - 3 -  (FOMC) decisions.6  But the same annual report made no reference to the Employment Act.
"For some people, the re wasn’t any question of whether the Employment Act of 1946 should be a top priority."
" From its earliest days , the c ivil r ights movement included full employment on a list of economic objectives deemed necessary to achieve the goals of freedom and political equality."
"Martin Luther King  and my cousin Floyd McKissick, Sr. , but I would like to focus on an individual who probably did as much as anyone to establish maxim um employment in 1977 as a goal assigned specifically to monetary policy."
" Four days after MLK’s death, in a speech at Memphis City Hall, she sa id that the right to employment had been on his mind: “ Every  man deserves a right to a job or an income ,” she said."
"85  - 4 -  opportunity, with full employment prominent on the list of demands."
"King used her considerable and growing stature to advocate for a broad agenda of economic empowerment, centered around the maximum -employment guarantee that had been law for decades."
" In 1973, the U nited States was hit with runaway inflation, this time accompanied by what became a deep recession —stagflation."
King joined with elements of the labor movement to c reate the National Committee for Full Employment/Full Employment Action Council.
" That  work culminated in 1975, wit h early versions of what would become the Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act  of 1978, also known as  the HumphreyHawkins  Act."
" HumphreyHawkins established the objectives  of maximum employment, stable prices, a balanced budget, and a balance of foreign trade , and it defined them by setting numerical goals."
 Coretta Scott King testified in favor of the legislation and its mandate of maximum employment.
" But one of HumphreyHawkins’ undeniable legacies is how, as it headed toward likely passage, its employment and inflation objectives were  enshr ined in the 1977 amendments to the Federal Reserve Act, establish ing the dual mandate of maximum em ployment and stable prices."
" Starting in 1979, the Federal Reserve Board published  the Monetary Policy Report , as required by HumphreyHawkins , and, along with the report’s release, the Chair regularly gave testimony on the Committee’s plans."
" In 2007, the FOMC began publishing a summary of the economic projections of its participants, in cluding the range of estimates of the long errun unemployment rate, an indication of their view s of maximum employment."
" Subsequently, t he FOMC responded forcefully to the deep recession caused by the 2008 financial crisis to support employment, helping us her in an expansion that eventually brought  the unemployment rate to its lowest level in 50 years."
" It also re acted  vigorously to the economic weakness associated with  the pandemic, and un employment has now returned to its pre -pandemic lows , even as we hav e worked to return inflation to our 2 percent objective ."
  Central banks around the world generally treat the stabilization of employment as an important policy objective .
 Yet  most have  employment mandates only informally or secondarily  in their statutory assignments.
" In contrast , the Federal Reserve’s mandate is clear that maximum employment is  on an equal footing with price stability."
 But Fed policymakers recognize  that the maximum level of employment is not directly measurable and that it changes  over time as the structure of our economy evolves.
" For that reason, we do not set a fixed numerical goal for maximum employment."
 This is wise considering that the past  three decades have  shown that unemployment  can fall well below the levels that economists once predicted would overheat the economy.
"   - 6 -  In a development that I suspect would please Augustus Hawkins and Coretta Scott King, in 2020, the FOMC declared that “ maximum  employment is a broad -based and inclusive goal.”8  It is now common for Fed policymakers to note with enthusiasm when longterm disparities in employment and wages between minorities and other groups narrow."
King’s quest for full employment is alive and well .
" I dare to wonder what Coretta Scott King would think about these developments, because of the experience I had as an undergraduate , meeting her  and hearing her talk about her lobbying for policies to promote employment and economic opportunity."
"King pushed the maximum -employment mandate as hard and consistently as she did because she believed, in her words, that “unemployment lies at t he root of all our major social problems."
”9  Economists also understand that employment is the key to a healthy economy.
 Maximum  employment boosts longrun (noninflationary) economic potential.
 Maximum employment also promotes business investment that boosts productivity and longrun economic potential.

 These are the benefits of the Fed’s maximum -employment goal and part of the legacy of Coretta Scott  King.
