"For release on delivery  8:30 a.m. EST (10:30 a.m. local time ) November 11, 2016      U.S. Monetary Policy from an International Perspective     Remarks by   Stanley Fischer   Vice Chair man  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   via videoconference to the   20th Annual Conference of the Central Bank of Chile   Santiago, Chile         November 11, 2016     I am grateful for the invitation to speak to you today about how U.S. monetary policy affects the global economy  and how foreign economic events affect U.S. monetary policy."
" Given the importance of the United States in international trade and in the global financial system, the monetary policy actions of the Federal Reserve influence the global economy through a wi de range of trade and financial channels."
" As I will discuss, each foreign econom y may be affected quite differently by U.S. monetary policy actions, and each may view spillovers from U.S. monetary policy as desirable or undesirable ."
" Even so, I am reasonably confident that the spillovers from ongoing U.S. monetary policy normalization will generally prove manageable for foreign economies.1   While most of my discussion will focus on monetary policy spillovers, I will begin by underscoring a different aspect of the interconnectedness of the U.S. economy --namely, how foreign developments have an important influence on U.S. output and inflation, and hence on the conduct of U.S. monetary policy."
 How Foreign Developments I nfluence U.S. Monetary Policy  The U.S. economy is affected significantly by foreign developments through both trade and financial channels.
" Given that about  oneeighth  of the goods and services produced in the United States are exported, a sizable component of U.S. aggregate demand depends on foreign consumption and investment decisions, and hence ultimately on the economic health of foreign economies."
" Although financial conditions have improved markedly in the advanced foreign economies and their monetary policy has been highly accommodative, these economies have yet to break out from the tepid growth they have experienced since the global f inancial c risis."
 Growth in the e merging market economies has also been disappointingly slow .
" For example, gross domestic product (GDP ) growth in Latin America declined to zero last year, far below the 3  to 4 percent growth rates achieved in the first few years of this decade.2  The emer ging market economies ( EMEs ) have weathered several bouts of financial market turbulence, including earlier this year , due to market concerns about economic growth in China and about its exchange rate system."
" With foreign growth relatively weak, the prospect of a gradual normalization of U.S. monetary policy contributed to a large appreciation of the dollar since mid -2014, with the real effective exchange value of the dollar rising a round 17 percent."
   These global developments materially slowed progress toward the Federal Reserve’s employment and inflation objectives.
" The sizable appreciation of the dollar has been a substantial drag on U.S. exports over the past two years, and hence subtracted from economic growth."
" The stronger dollar, in concert with lower oil and other                                                  2 These estimates are taken from table A1 of  the Statistical Appendix of the October 2016 World Economic Outlook  and report GDP growth for Latin America and the Caribbean."
"   - 3 - commodity prices, has also markedly reduced import price inflation and has been a factor keeping inflation well below the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) 2  percent goal.3  These developments have influenced the FOMC’s decision s to maintain  a very accommodative monetary policy longer than members of the FOMC had expected in 2014 and through the end of 2015."
" I am cautiously optimistic that the drag on the U.S. economy and inflation from past dollar appreciation may have mostly worked itself out, and that foreign economies are on a somewhat more secure footing that poses smaller downside risks to the U.S. economy."
" It is also possible that foreign econom ies may outperform forecasts, which would provide a boost to U.S. employment prospects and also to inflation."
" While forecasts are inherently uncertain, we will, as always, pay close attention to foreign developments , given their significant consequences f or the U.S. economy, and take such developments into account in determining the appropriate stance of U.S. monetary policy."
  Key Channels through Which U.S. Monetary Policy Affects Foreign Economies  I have focused thus far on the effects of global developments on the U.S. economy and financial markets  and argued that these developments may have an important influence on U.S. monetary policy  actions .
 I will next consider how U.S. monetary policy actions tend to affect foreign economies.
" S pillovers from th e policy                                                  3  My 2015 speech “The Transmission of Exchange Rate Changes to Output and Inflation” provides some quantitative assessment of how changes in the dollar affect U.S. output and inflation, including estimates from the staff’s empirical model of U.S. trade described in  a recent IFDP Notes article by Gruber, McCallum, and Vigfusson (2016)."
"  - 4 - actions of major central banks, including especially those of the Federal Reserve, have been the focus of analysis and debate for decades and have attracted considerable attention since the global f inancial c risis.4   Foreign economies were affect ed when the Fed engaged in unconventional monetary policy stimulus and will likely experience some effects of the Fed’s ongoing normalization of policy."
 The Federal Reserve ’s focus on supporting domestic objectives for inflation and employment has sometim es been criticized as having potentially undesirable effects on the global economy.
 It is  indeed likely that the depreciation of the dollar that accompanied U.S. asset purchases and forward guidance reduced foreign net exports and thus weighed on foreign GDP through the exchange rate  channel .
" However, our accommodative policies also increased U.S. domestic demand, a second key channel of transmission that  operated to boost the net exports of our foreign trading partners."
" Empirical estimates suggest that these countervailing effects roughly canceled                                                  4 Exchange rate issues leading up to the Great Depression were prominent, particularly vis -àvis the French franc, which was returned to the gold standard at what was seen at the time as a highly favorable rate (Irwin, 2012)."
 The pioneering analysis of Mundell (1963) and Fleming (1962) provides the standard framework for post -World War II analysis of the channels through which monetary policy actions are transmitted abroad.
"   - 5 - each other out , on average , for our trading partners so that their net exports were not very much  affected .6  Moreover, insofar as our unconventional policies reduced global interest rates  and boosted asset prices --a third channel that tended to expand foreign as well as  domestic demand --these actions were probably mildly  stimulative for the global economy ."
" While foreign exports are hurt due to the implied appreciation of foreign  currencies --reducing foreign GDP about 0.15 percent , according to their estimates --foreign exports are boosted by nearly the same amount due to the policy -induced expansion of U.S. domestic demand."
" However, given that the fall in U.S. interest rates tends to reduce foreign interest rates --at least on average--by around half as much, my colleagues concluded that U.S. monetary stimulus likely has noticeable  positive spillovers to for eign economies ."
                                                       6 See Ammer  and others  (2016) for both a detailed discussion of these channels and estimates of the effects of U.S. monetary policy actions on foreign economies.
 Economies with more open capital accounts and that keep their exchange rate relativ ely stable against the dollar experience larger positive effects on their GDP  of an expansionary Fed monetary policy action.
" The larger positive spillovers reflect the fact that their own interest rates move more in lockstep with U.S. interest rates, whil e the effects on their traded goods sector from the exchange rate channel are smaller."
" For example, Hong Kong, which has pegged its currency to the U.S. dollar at a fixed exchange rate since 1983, is an extreme illustration  of an economy in which Fed acti ons pass  through almost one  to one to domestic interest rates."
" Conversely, spillovers from U.S. policy actions tend to be smaller to economies that have flexible exchange rates and adjust their policy rates based on domestic conditions ; or, alternatively,  to economies with less open capital accounts  such as China."
 Most of the advanced foreign economies eventually welcomed the positive spillovers to their domestic output that w ere due to U.S. unconventional monetary policy easing.
" Because these economies generally experienced slower recoveries than the United States as well as undesirably low inflation, their central banks also wanted to pursue highly accommodative policies and t ook complementary actions --including forward guidance and large -scale asset purchases --to spur economic recovery."
" Given that the Fed’s easing raised equity prices and strengthened the demand for risky  - 7 - assets around the globe, it probably contributed to the growing resource pressures in some of these economies."
 EMEs had to choose between an accommodative monetary polic y that was more in line with the United States and other advanced economies versus a tighter policy stance likely to cause their exchange rates  to appreciate markedly and possibly cause a relatively sharp contraction in the tradable sectors of their econom ies.
" While the more accommodative stance had the attractive feature that it would lessen the hurt to the export sector, the downside was that it was more likely to lead to overheating and high inflation that could be costly to correct."
"   My sense is that  most EME central banks had considerable latitude to keep inflation near target and output near potential through maintaining a relatively tight policy, and thus to limit spillovers from easing by the advanced economies."
" But while I think that there is a strong case for focusing on a limited set of objectives, including to ensure that inflation expectations remain firmly anchored, it is also important to recognize the tough tradeoffs faced by EME central banks given their understandable desire to avoid causing a sharp slowdown in exports."
 The tradeoff faced by EME central bankers helps illustrate some of the challenges posed by monetary policy divergence between the United States and other economies closely tied to it through economic and financial channel s.
" Moreover, the Fed’s monetary policy actions were reinforced by many steps to help safeguard the U.S. financial system   - 8 - and increase its resilience to shocks ."
"   U.S. Monetary Poli cy Going Forward:  Prospective Divergence  Policy divergence remains a familiar theme today, but the focus has obviously shifted to the consequences of a tightening in U.S. monetary policy on the rest of the global economy."
" In my vie w, the Fed appears reasonably close to achieving both the inflation and employment components of its mandate."
" Accordingly, the case for removing accommodation gradually is  quite strong, keeping in mind that the future is uncertain and that monetary policy  is not on a preset course."
" Indeed, the large rise in U.S. bond yields during this episode precipitated a nearly commensurate rise in interest rates in many foreign economies and caused the prices of risky assets to fall globally."
" EMEs  with weak fundamentals experienced sharp capital outflows, an abrupt tightening of financial conditions, and large exchange rate depreciations.9  The EME experience in 2013 seemed reminiscent of past episodes of U.S. tightening --including in the 1980s and again in the mid1990s --that had sizable adverse spillovers to EMEs, particularly in Latin America."
" I am reasonably optimistic that the spillovers from ongoing U.S. normalization will be manageable for the foreign economies, including the EMEs.  While the re will almost inevitably be some bumps along the road, there are a number of reasons why I think that that policy normalization will not cause sizable disruptions for our trading partners : • First, the Fed will remove accommodation only in response to an outlook for improving economic conditions and firming inflation."
" For example, the B ank of England’s threshold strategy announced in the summer of 2013--promising to keep policy rates extraordinarily low at least until unemployment fell below 7 percent --lowered the expected path of policy rates significantly by pushing back expectations of liftoff."
" India was dubbed one of the “Fragile Five” economies during the taper t antrum and, during that episode , experienced large capital outflows, a spike in borrowing costs, and sizable exchange rate depreciation.10  Since that time, India has markedly improved its macroeconomic framework, cutting its inflation rate by half to around 5 percent, anchoring inflation expectations more securely, and reducing what had been large and persistent fiscal and current account deficits."
"  Somewhat more generally, the improved macroeconomic frameworks in many EMEs  achieved over the past couple of decades --with inflation targeting often playing a key role --has enabled these economies to pursue countercyclical policies to a much greater degree than in the past and should help insulate them from monetary policy spillovers.11                                                  10  Basu, Eichengreen , and Gupta (2014) describe how India’s economy and financial markets were affected by the t aper tantrum."
" 11  Coulibaly (2012) draws on a large cross -country data set to investigate empirically the factors that have allowed EMEs greater scope to pursue coun tercyclical monetary policies, and it highlights the importance of both inflation targeting and financial reforms that enhance transparency."
"  - 11 - • A fourth reason that spillovers could be mitigated is that U.S. policy rates are likely to increase only gradually --assuming that economic developments unfold reasonably in line with expectations --and t o plateau at a significantly lower level than the historical average.12  The low long -run level of the policy rate reflects a number of factors --including slower productivity growth, demographic change, and a higher demand for safe assets --that have pushed down the real longrun neutral rate, which is the real interest rate needed to keep the economy at full  employment in the longer -run."
" While there are good grounds to expect that spillovers from U.S. monetary policy actions will be manageable for most of our trading partners, events may unfold differently than expected."
" To i llustrate, a noticeably faster U.S. recovery would require a more rapid removal of U.S. accommodation and could exert noticeably larger spillovers abroad by putting more upward pressure on foreign interest rates and by inducing larger depreciations of fore ign currencies."
" Despite greater policy divergence, many of our trading partners would receive a net boost to their GDP provided that the stimulus to their exports --from stronger U.S. demand and a weaker domestic currency --was sufficient to offset possible  tightening in their financial conditions."
"  - 12 - spreads, especially if their central banks were called on to tighten monetary policy to keep inflat ion at bay."
" While such uncertainty is a constant feature of the landscape we confront as policymakers, both the U.S. and global econom ies will be served best if we keep our own house s in order and ensure that policy rates are adjusted as appropriate to ac hieve our inflation and employment objectives."
