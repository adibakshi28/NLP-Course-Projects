"For release on delivery  8:00 p.m. E DT (7:00 p.m. CDT) October 13, 20 21 The View f rom Here:  The Outlook for the U.S. Economy and Implications for Monetary Policy  Remarks by  Michelle W."
" And I’m pleased to have the opportunity to share with you, the students of South Dakota State Universit y (SDSU), my experience as a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors and my outlook for the U.S. economy.1   Today I will speak to you about my outlook for the  U.S. economy and what the Federal Reserve has been  doing to support economic activity during the COVID -19 pandemic recovery."
"  - 2 - As students of economics, you may already know that the Federal Reserve conducts monetary policy to support a strong and stable econom y in the United States."
" Our official mandate from the Congress is to pursue two goals , maximum employment and stable prices."
" Together, we commonly refer to these objectives as our  dual mandate, and pursuing both at the same time means that we seek the maximum level of employment that is consistent with price stability."
" Regarding the price -stability goal, our framework references an annual inflation rate of 2  percent as most consistent w ith our pricestability goal over the longer run."
" The Fed pursues its monetary policy goals using a variety of tools, but the  main policy tool is the  federal funds rate,  a key interest rate for overnight borrowing by commercial banks that influences other interest rates throughout the economy."
" Lower interest rates tend to stimulate demand —for housing, cars and other durable goods, and business investment, for example —which boost s economic activity  and has the potential to push up inflation."
 Higher interes t rates tend to slow the economy and tend to push inflation  down .
"  In normal times, monetary policy decisions are made eight times each year through votes of members of the Federal Open Market Committee  (FOMC) .2  In preparation for each meeting, the FOMC participant s analyze the latest economic data and assess where the economy stands relative to our two mandated goals."
" And, because monetary policy decisions take some time to flow through to, or have their full effect  on, the economy, FOMC participants must form a view about how they think the economy  2 Except in very unusual circumstances, monetary policy decisions are made during our regular FOMC meetings eight times each year."
" In addition to understanding where the economy is at any given point in time , making a judgment about where it is heade d is also crucial to monetary policy."
" Yet our responsibility is to do just that—make predictions about how e conomic activity will evolve , and act on those forecasts  in real time, to ensure  that monetary policy can help support a strong economy."
 Now  let m e tell you a bit about how I approach our monetary policy decisions.
" With this in mind, I recently restarted the Fed Listens p rocess at the Board, in which we focus not on monetary policy and hear from a range of different people about how the economy is affecting them."
" As the member of the Board of Governors with experience in communi ty banking, I often speak t o local ba nkers , who are excellent source s to understand the important effects of monetary policy decisions on Main Street."
" It is concerni ng to see that South Dakota’s tribal communities, pa rticularly thos e on rural reservations, are experiencing a slower employment recovery tha n in other parts of the country."
"  As much as any other preparation for FOMC meetings, all of these conversations are vital inputs for my consideration of the data influencing my monetary policy decisions every six to eight weeks."
" Now that I’ve given you a n idea  of what this process looks like for me as a member of the FOMC, let me describe my view of current economic conditions, my outlook for the economy, and how I believe monetary policy can continue to support the recovery."
" Along the way, I will also highlight a few factors that I believe could pose a risk to continued progress toward our maximum -employment and inflation goals."
"  - 6 - First, looking at the job market, stringent economic and social  distancing restrictions imposed in an effort to contain the spread of the virus resulted in enormous job losses in the early months of the pandemic, with the unemployment rate surging from 3.5 percent in February 2020 (a 50year low) to 14.8 percent in April 2020."
" Since the middle of last year, however, as the econom y started to reopen, we have seen  steady progress toward maximum employment."
" That progress continued in September, with the unemployment rate moving down to 4.8  percent."
  At least part of the recen t slowing in payroll growth seems to reflect a limited supply of labor.
"In contrast, indicators of labor demand, such as  unfilled job openings, remain exceptionally strong."
" On balance, I anticipate that employment will continue to move up in the months ahead, although for several reasons  that are unrelated to the stance of  monetary policy, I don’t expect that we will see employment fully return to pre -pandemic levels any time soon."
"  First, despite all of the economic progress, it is clear that switching off economic activity for such a long period has had lasting consequences , and expectations of a smooth resumption of production, transportation,  and business operations may not be met for some time."
" In addition, many older workers dislocated by the pandemic effectively retired and probably w ill not rejoin the workforce even in a much stronger job market."
"  While I would not want to place too much weight on one or two months of data, the most recent reports on employment and anecdotal reports from a wide range of businesses suggest that , even when offering higher wages and signing bonuses,  many employers are finding it difficult  to fill open positions."
"  History tells us that the longer workers remain out of the workforce,  the less likely it is that they will return to employment and the greater the likelihood that they will lose skills and connections with the job market , which co uld weigh on labor force participation for years to come ."
" The Federal Reserve’s policy tools are useful for promoting a strong job market, but they are not well suited to  addressing these harmful effects on labor supply."
" Another  reason for my cautious outlook for employment growth is that , while large firms have adequate resources, funding options , and flexibility to withstand pandemic -related disruptions, many small businesses without those advantages have closed permanently ."
"   Let me turn now  to our other monetary policy goal, price stability."
" Earlier this year, as the economy was reopening, we saw a pronounced pickup in inflation, as prices for motor vehicles, electronics, and other goods rose especially rapidly."
" Demand for semiconductors has surged because of  a sharp increase of spending on hightech equipment and consumer electronics, investment in new wireless networks , and increasing usage of semiconductors in motor vehicles, appliances, and other goods."
" We are seeing s hipments at reco rd levels , and more capacity is expected to come on line, but the combination of strong demand and intermittent disruptions to this  complex supply chain poses a risk that it could be some  time before semiconductor supply issues are resolved ."
" Th e lack of new cars for sale on dealer lots has also boosted demand and prices this year for used cars  and spilled over to the rental car market, leading to soaring car rental prices ."
" As the various supply bottlenecks we are currently seeing are gradually resolved , we should see  monthly inflation readings step down further from th e high rates we  have observed this year."
"  Another source of inflation risk comes  from  the lower labor force participation , which , as I mentioned earlier , has led some firms to offer inducements to bring potential workers back, including hiring bonuses and higher wages."
" Wage increases and t hese  - 10 - additional  employee  investments are increasing  firms’ costs,  potentially adding to inflationary pressures."
" In their planning for next season’s planting, farmers are much more concerned about input cost inflation ."
" Another source of inflationary pressure is the rapid increase in house prices, something that also raises potential concerns about valuation pressures."
 The ongoing strength in housing demand is also notably driving up rental costs .
"  If elevated inflation readings continue into and through the next year,  we may begin to see an imprint on longer -run inflation expectations."
"  While short -term inflation expectations have m oved  up with the recent period  of increased inflation, longer -term measures have remained relatively stable."
" As we know, after r eaching uncomfortably high levels in the 1970s and early 1980s, in more recent decades , inflation has run close to our 2 percent  goal, helping anchor the public’s inflation expectations at levels that seem consistent with our goal."
 This is relevant  because the Fed has  long considered the  anchoring of inflation expectations  an important condition for meeting our monetary policy goals.
"  Finally, let’s turn to the implications for monetary policy more broadly and the FOMC’s most recent decision at our meeting in September ."
" When actions taken to mitigate the spread  of COVID19 began to disrupt the  U.S. economy and financial markets  in the first half of last year , the FOMC cut sh ortterm interest rates to near zero  and began purchasing Treasury securities and agency mortgage -backed securities ."
" By the middle of last year,  we were seeing signs of resilience in economic activity, with  labor market conditions beginning to recover from the economic effects of the pandemic."
"    - 12 - In December , we indicated that we would start scaling back our asset purchases after the U.S.  economy had made “substantial further progress” toward our maximum -employment and price -stability goals.3  We have been closely monitoring that progress since then, and, at our most recent policy meeting, we noted that, if the economy continues to improve as expected, this scaling back, or tapering  of our asset purchases , may soon be warranted."
" In particular, I am concerned that our asset purchases could now be contributing to valuation pressures , especially in housing and equity markets, or that maintaining a highly accommodative monetary policy stance at this stage of the economic expansion may pose risks to the stability of longer -term inflation expectations."
"  - 13 - remain , I expect that the recovery will continue in the coming months, and that steady progress will be made toward our  maximumemployment and pricestability  goals."
