" The outlook is bright,  but uncertainty remains, and  employment and inflation are far from our goals."
" The latest jobs report  is a reminder that the path of reopening and recovery —like the shutdown—is  likely to be uneven and difficult to predict, so basing monetary policy on outcomes rather than the outlook will serve us well ."
" Real personal consumption expenditure s (PCE) jum ped 10.7 percent, supporting a robust 6.4 percent growth rate in real gross domestic product ( GDP ) in the first quarter,  despite a large  runoff of inventories  amid supply chain bottlenecks ."
" For instance , the strength of domestic demand this year relative to next will depend on how quickly or slowly a large share of accumulated household savings is  spent out ."
" This , in turn , hinges in part  on the distribution  of household savings  and how much is concentrated among households who are less likely to spend, perhaps because their services consumption returns only to pre -COVID levels or their near -term demand for durable goods has largely be en satiated .4   There is also  uncertainty about  how much of the strong domestic aggregate demand will leak abroad rather than translating into domestic output."
" As  supply chain and shipping bottlenecks ease, international spillovers could lead to some sli ppage between the increase in domestic demand and  domestic  resource utilization ."
"  - 3 - spending and GDP  this year , the absence of similar transfers will lower the growth rate of spending next year relative to this year ."
 The boost to spending from pent up demand this year as the economy reopens is also unlikely to be repeated next year.
" O ver the past few months, the demand for workers has strengthened  as CO VIDaffected sectors have  reopen ed."
" A lthough the fraction of the population ages 25 to 54 that is employed has improved in each month of this year , the current prime -age employment -topopulation ( EPOP)  ratio  of 76.9 percent  is still far from the 80 percent level reached during both of the past two expansions .5     On the demand side, we saw  a welcome increase of 331,000 jobs  in the hard -hit leisure and hospitality sector in April following a 206,000 increase in March."
 The increase in average hours worked and the reduction in peopl e who are working part time but would prefer full -time work suggest some employers are responding to the increase in demand by lengthening workweeks .
"   5 For additional discussion, see Lael Brainard (2021), “How Should We Think about Full Employment in the Federal Reserve ’s Dual Mandate?"
"  - 6 - There is good reason to expect a strong rebound in employment over coming quarters, although the different forces affecting demand and supply may lead to uneven rates of progress."
 The u nemployment rate remains elevated  at 8.9 percent when we adjust  the narrow  6.1 percent  U3 measure of unemployment to also reflect  workers who have left the labor force since the pandemic started and those  who are misclassifi ed.
" As of the latest reading, there is an employment  shortfall of 8.2 million relative to the  prepandemic level , and th e employment shortfall is  over 10 million if we  take into account the secular job growth that would have occurred over the period since February 2020 in normal circumstances.11  The path of inflation is also difficult to predict, although there are a variety of reasons to expect an increase in in flation associated with reopening that is largely transitory."
"  Most immediately, base effects are likely to contribute substantially to the 12month readings of headline and core PCE inflation in April and May as the price declines of March and April 2020  roll out of the 12month calculation ."
  It is much more difficult to predict the size and duration of supply -side bottlenecks and how these will interact with the pattern of demand to feed through into inflation.
" T he production of certain semiconductors may take some time to ramp up, and  11 For example, during 2019, after the recovery had matured and the unemployment rate had reached 4 percent, total nonfarm payrolls increased by an average o f 168,000 workers per month, or roughly 2 million workers per year."
" If past experience is any guide, production will rise to meet the level of goods demand before too long."
 T he supply–demand imbalances i n the in -person services sector are expected to be res olved within a few quarters with progress on virus control and the return of in -person schooling.
" And demand growth itself is expected to moderate after a reopening surge, broadly coinciding with the time when some of the current tailwinds from fiscal sup port and makeup consumption turn to headwinds."
" Of course, there may be additional demand and supply surprises that could further complicate the inflation picture ."
"  To the extent that  supply chain conge stion and other reopening frictions  are transitory, they are unlikely to generate persistently higher inflation on their own."
" A persistent material increase in inflation would require not just that wages or prices increase for a period after reopening , but also a broad  expectation that they will continue to increase at a persistently higher pace ."
 A limited  period of pandemic -related price increases is unlikely to durably change inflation dynamics .
"Rudd (2017), “The Passthrough of Labor Costs to Price Inflation,”  Journal of Money, Credit and Banking,  vol."
"Thus, t here are compelling reasons to expect the well -entrenched inflation dynamics that prevailed for a quarter -century to reassert themselves next year as imbalances associated with reopening are resolved, work and consumption patterns settle into a post -pandemic “new normal,” and some of the current tailwinds shift to headwinds.14   I will be carefully monitoring measures of longer -term inflation  expectations  to ensure they are well anchored at 2 percent ."
" To date, various measures suggest inflation  expectations remain well  anchored and broadly consistent with our new framework."
" The Index of C ommon I nflation E xpectations  moved back to 2 percent in the first quarter, returning to its level in 2018, which is lower than its level prior to 2014.15  In addition, the term structure of marketbased measures of inflation compensation is  consistent with  market participant s expec ting a limited period of inflation above  2 percent ."
" A straight read of the difference between the forward nominal Treasury curve and the forward Treasury Inflation -Protected Securities curve implies inflation compensation is expected  13 Details on the CFO Survey, which is a partnership of Duke University, the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, a nd the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, can be found on the Richmond Fed ’s website at https://www.richmondfed.org/research/national_economy/cfo_survey."
 14 Statistical models estimate that underlying core PCE inflation ranges from 0.1 to 0.4  percentage point below the 2 percent longer -run target.

  I will remain attentive to the risk that what seem like transitory inflationary pressures could prove persistent  as I closely monitor the incoming data.
" Should this risk manifest, we have the tools and the experience to gently guide inflation back to our  target."
 Achieving our infla tion goal requires firmly anchoring inflation expectations at 2 percent.
 The latest  employment report reminds us that realized outcomes can diverge from  forward projections and underscores the value  of patience.
" As the economy reopens fully and the recovery gathers momentum , it will be important to remain patiently focused on achieving the maximum -employment and inflation outcomes in our guidance."
