"E ST November 14, 2019          The Federal Reserve’s Review of Its Monetary Policy Strategy,  Tools, and Communication Practices     Remarks by   Richard H ."
" This year’s conference, “Fed Policy:  A Shadow Review ,” takes up  the Federal Reserve’s 2019 review of our monetary policy strategy, tools, and communication practices ."
" This topic is , of course , timely and one to which I and others have devoted much thought over the past year .1 Motivation for the Review  Although I will have more to say about the review in a moment, let  me state at the outset that we believe our existing framework , which has been in place since 2012, has served us well and has enabled us to achieve and sustain our statutorily  assigned goals of maximum employment and price stability."
" However, we also believe now is a good time to step back and assess whether, and in w hat possible ways, we can refine our strategy, tools, and communication practices to achieve and maintain our goals as consistently and robustly as possible.2 With the U.S. economy operating at or close to maximum employment and price stability, now is an especially opportune time to conduct this review."
" The unemployment  rate is near a 50 -year low, and inflation is running close to our 2 percent objective."
 2 Fuhrer and others (2018) explore the desirability of comprehensive reviews of the monetary policy framework.
" Perhaps most significantly, neutral interest rates appear to have fallen in the United  States .3  A fall in neutral rates increases t he likelihood that a central bank’s policy rate will hit its effective lower bound (ELB) in future economic downturns."
" That development, in turn, could make it more difficult during downturns for monetary  policy to support spending and employment and to keep inflation from falling too far below the central bank’s  objective —2 percent in the case of the Federal Reserve.4 Another key development in recent decades is that price inflation appears  less responsive to resource slack."
" That is, the short -run price Phillips curve —if not the wage Phillips curve —ap pears to have flattened, implying a change in the dynamic relationship between inflation and employment.5  A flatter Phillips curve permits the Federal Reserve to support employment more aggressively during downturns —as was the case during and after the Great Recession —because a sustained inflation breakout is less likely when the Phillips curve is flatter.6  However, a flatter Phillips curve also increases the cost, in terms of lost economic output, of revers ing unwelcome increases in longer -run inflation                                                  3 For evidence of a fall i n neutral rates of interest in the United States and abroad, see, among several contributions, King and Low (2014); Holston, Laubach, and Williams (2017); Rachel and Smith (2017); and Brand, Bielecki, and Penalver (2018)."
" 4 For assessments of the risks tha t U.S. monetary policy will be constrained by the ELB and its implications for economic activity and inflation, see Kiley and Roberts (2017), Erceg and others (2018), Swanson  (2018), and Chung and others (2019)."
" 6 One potential contributor to the flattening of the Phillips curve is a change in the conduct of monetary policy since the 1980s toward greater stabilization of inflation and economic activity; for evidence of such a change, see Clarida, Galí, and Gertler (2000); Boivin and Giannoni (2006); and Boivin, Kiley, and Mishkin (2010)."
" Similarly, the adoption of an explicit inflation ob jective, along with greater certainty regarding the conduct of monetary policy, can help anchor longer -term inflation expectations and stabilize actual inflation in response to shocks."
" Thus, a flatter Phillips curve makes it all the more important that inflation expectations remain anchored at levels consistent with our 2 percent inflation objective.7  Based on the evidence I have reviewed, I judge that U.S. inflation expectations today do reside at the low end of  a range I consider consistent with our  pricestability mandate."
" This low unemployment rate, 3.6 percent in October , has been interpreted by many as suggesting that the labor market is currently operating beyond full employment."
" However, we cannot directly observe the level of the unemployment rate that is consistent with full employment and price stability, u*, but must infer it from data via models."
 I myself believe that the range of plausible estimates of u* extends to 4 percent and below and includes the  current unemployment rate of 3.6 percent.
" As the unemployment rate has declined in recent years, labor force participation for people in their prime working years has increased significantly, with the October  participation rate at a cycle high of 82.8 percent.8  Increased prime -age participation has provided employers with additional labor resources and has been one factor, along with a pickup in labor productivity, restraining inflationary pressures."
                                                  7 See Yellen (2015) for a discussion of inflation dynamics and monetary  policy; see Erceg and others (2018) for a quantitative exploration of the monetary policy implications of a flat Phillips curve in an uncertain economic environment.
" Since the mid -1980s, movements in both realized inflation and measures of longer -term in flation expectations have been somewhat muted, complicating the task of extracting the precise role of inflation expectations as a determinant of realized inflation."
 Faust and Wright (2013) review the literature on inflation forecasting and present eviden ce in support of the conclusion that measures of inflation expectations help predict the trend in inflation.
" Cecchetti and others (2017) showed that while the level of realized inflation and four -quarter -ahead inflation expectations are positively correlated, changes in these variables have been largely uncorrelated since the mid -1980s."
" These authors suggest that, in a low and stable inflation environment, policymakers should pay attention to a wide array of other indicators in determining the implication s of movements in realized inflation and measures of inflation expectations."
" 8 The box “The Labor Force Participation Rate for Prime -Age Individuals” in the Board’s July 2018 Monetary Policy Report  contains a discussion of recent developments in labor forc e participation rates for prime -age individuals; see Board of Governors (2018, pp."
"Also, although the labor market is robust, there is no evidence that rising wages are putting excess ive upward pressure on price inflation."
 Wages today are increasing  broadly in line with productivity growth and underlying inflation.
" As I  have written before, labor’s share tends to rise as expansions endure and the labor market tightens.9  In recent cycles —and thus far in this cycle —this rise in labor’s share has not put excessive upward pressure on price inflation."
"Scope of the Review  The Federal Reserve Act instructs the Fed to conduct  monetary  policy “so as to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and mo derate longterm interest rates.”10  Our review this year takes this statutory mandate as given and also takes as given that inflation at a rate of 2 percent is most consistent over the longer run with the congressional mandate."
" 10 Even though the act lists three distinct goals, the Federal Reserve’s mandate for monetary policy is commonly known as the “dual mandate.”  Th e reason is that an economy in which people who want to work either have a job or are likely to find one fairly quickly and in which the price level (meaning a broad measure of the price of goods and services purchased by consumers) is stable creates the c onditions needed for interest rates to settle at moderate levels."
" - 5 - Our existing monetary policy strategy is laid out in the Committee’s Statement  on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy.11  First adopted in January 2012, the  statement indicates that the Committee seeks to mitigate deviations of inflation from 2 percent and deviations of employment from assessments of its maximum level."
" In doing so, the F ederal O pen M arket C ommittee (FOMC)  recognizes that these assessments of maximum employment are necessarily unce rtain and subject to revision."
"As a practical matte r, our current strategy shares  many elements with the policy framework known as “flexible inflation targeting.”12  However, the Fed’s mandate is much more explicit about the role of employment than that of most flexible inflation -targeting central banks, and our statement reflects this by stating that when the two  sides of the mandate are in conflict, neither one tak es preceden ce over the other."
" Three Questions  The first question is, “Can the Federal Reserve best meet its statutory objectives with its existing monetary policy strategy, or should it consider strategies that aim  to reverse past misses of the inflation objective?”  Under our current approach as well as the approaches of many central banks  around the world, persistent inflation shortfalls of the target are treated as “bygones.”   Central banks are generally believed to have effective tools for preventing persistent                                                  11 The statement is available on the Board’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/file s/FOMC_LongerRunGoals.pdf ."
"  - 6 - inflation overshoots, but the ELB on interest rates makes persistent undershoots more of a challenge."
" Persistent inflation shortfalls  carry the risk that longer -term inflation expect ations become anchored below the stated inflation goal.13 In part because of that concern, some economists have advocated “makeup ” strategies under which policymakers seek to undo past inflation deviations from target."
"These strategies include targeting ave rage inflation and price -level targeting, in which policymakers seek to stabilize the price level around a constant growth path.14  Other makeup strategies seek to reverse shortfalls in policy accommodation at the ELB by keeping the policy rate lower for lo nger than otherwise would be the case.15  In many  models that incorporate the ELB, these makeup strategies lead to better average performance on both legs of the dual mandate.16                                                  13 These risks could be exacerbated if households and businesses expect monetary policy to be insuf ficiently accommodative because of proximity to the ELB."
 14 Eggertsson and Woodford (2003) provide an early discussi on of how optimal monetary policy at the ELB entails a commitment to reflate the price level during the subsequent economic expansion.
 Nessén and Vestin (2005) discuss the relationship between average inflation targeting and pricelevel targeting.
 There is a dearth of empirical evidence on strategies seeking to make up for inflation deviations.
 Central banks that pursue an inflation goal generally seek to achieve a specific rate of inflation by some time horizon —typically a couple of years ahead or over the “medium run” —without regard to past inflation deviations.
" One exception is the Reserve Bank of Australia, whose inflation goal is specified as a range of  “2–3 per  cent, on average, over the medium term” and thus might embed some notion of history dependence."
" However, Ruge -Murcia (2014) argues that the drift in the price level in Australia is comparable with the drifts observed in economies with purely forward -looking specification of the inflation goal."
 See also Kiley and Roberts (2017) for a strategy in which policymakers aim for inflation higher than 2 percent during economic expansions to compensate for below -target realizations of inflation during economic downturns.
" The box “Complexities of M onetary Policy Rules” in the Board’s July 2018 Monetary Policy Report  contains an application of such a modified rule; see Board of Governors (2018, pp."
"  - 7 - The success of makeup strategies relies on households and firms believing  in advance that the makeup will, in fact, be delivered when the time comes —for example, that a persistent inflation shortfall will be met by future inflation above 2  percent."
" As is well known from the research literature, makeup strategies, in general, a re not time consistent because when the time comes to push inflation above 2 percent, conditions at that time will not justify that action."
" The next question the review is consider ing is, “Are existing monetary policy  tools adequate to achieve and maintain maximum employment and price stability, or should the toolkit be expanded?"
" And, if so, how?”  The FOMC’s primary monetary policy tool is its target range for the federal funds rate."
" In addition to using these two additional monetary policy tools, the Federal Reserve implemented a number of ot her measures to stabilize the financial system, increase household and business confidence, and more generally support the economic recovery."
" These enhancements include the Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy; postmeeting press c onferences; various statements about the principles  and strategy guiding the Committee’s normalization of monetary policy  following the financial crisis ; and quarterly summaries of individual FOMC participants’ economic projections, assessments about the a ppropriate path of the federal funds rate, and judgments of the uncertainty and balance of risks around their projections.18 As part of the review, we are assess ing the Committee’s current  and past communications and additional forms of communication that c ould be helpful."
" For example, there might be ways to improve communication about the coordination of policy tools or the interplay between monetary policy and financial stability."
"                                                 18 Starting in 1979, the Federal Reserve published a summary of individual economic projections from various Board members, FOMC members, or FOMC participants in the semiannual Monetary Policy Report."
" Last summer, the FOMC began to assess what we have learned at the Fed Listens  events and to receive briefings from S ystem staff on topics relevant to the review.20  At our July meeting, FOMC participants agreed that our current framework for monetary policy has served the Committee and the U.S. economy well over the past decade."
"  - 10 - At our September meeting, we discussed  makeup strategies in the context of a lower neutral policy interest rate, a reduction in conventional policy space, and a higher likelihood that future economic downturns w ill involve a ret urn to the ELB."
 We generally agreed that our current monetary policy framework is flexible enough to allow the Committee to choose the policy actions that best support our dual -mandate objectives in a wide variety of economic circumstances.
" In particular, we have not yet begun to consider potential changes to communication practices, including the Committee’s consensus Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy ."
" The s tatement  has help ed articulat e and clarify the Federal Reserve’s approach to monetary policy , and we have agreed that any changes we might make to our strategy would likely call for some modification of th is consensus statement."
