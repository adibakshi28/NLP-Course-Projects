" LIBOR was the principal  benchmark used to set interest rates for a vast number of commercial loans, mortgages, securities, derivatives, and other products."
"LIBOR was intended to be a measure of the average interest rate at which large banks can borrow in wholesale funding markets for different periods of time, ranging from overnight to one month, three months, and beyond."
" LIBOR is an unsecured rate , which means  that it measures interest rates for borrowings that are made without collateral  and therefore include some credit risk ."
