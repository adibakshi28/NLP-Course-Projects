"    For release on delivery  8:50 a.m. EDT   September 22, 2023         Generative AI, Productivity, the Labor Market, and Choice Behavior      Remarks by   Lisa D ."
"Cook  Member     Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at the   National Bureau of Economic Research  Economics of Artificial Intelligence Conference, Fall 2023      Toronto, Canada             September 22, 2023     Introduction As I was in 2018, I am excited to speak to you at the National Bureau of  Economic Research (NBER) artificial intelligence (AI) conference, in a city that is a world -class center of AI research and business start -ups, to discuss AI and its prospective effec ts on productivity and the labor market."

" Moreover, observers have noted that AI models sometimes harbor, if not amplify, the biases found in their training data, leading to malign effects on decisions about mortgage approvals, insurance rates, medical diagnoses, and even pretrial detention.4  And discrimination is not just an equity issue —it also holds down economic growth, as I show in my own work.5 The range of potential social effects of  AI is wide, as will be explore d in the next presentation .6  In general, I am optimistic about broad benefits accruing to the economy and society from the use of generative AI —including more productive and less tedious work in offices, labs, factories, and warehouses —provided we address the very real concerns I just mentioned, and othe rs like them."

 I will return to this point later after offering some thoughts on the potential for AI to affect productivity and the  labor market.
  Why do I focus on AI as a monetary policymaker?
 The Federal Reserve’s dual mandate is to promote maximum employment and stable prices.
" When firms deploy technologies that make workers more productive, they create the conditions for great er wage growth consistent with stable prices."
 And the labor market adjustment that follows as the economy adapts to technical change can affect maximum employment.
 AI and Productivity  The impact of AI on the economy and monetary policy will depend on whet her AI is just another app or something more profound.
" General purpose technologies have three key features: (1) they are widely used across the economy, (2) they improve st eadily over a long period of time, and (3) they raise the productivity of research and development (R&D).7  Could generative AI have these features?"

" Empirical evidence is still patchy, but there  is work showing that generative AI improves productivity in a variety of settings, including computer coding, customer service, language translation, and robotics.8 Second, will AI itself improve steadily over time?"

" However, we do know that historically the journey from innovation to productivity has sometimes been a long and uneven one."
" An often -cited example is the electric dynamo, which was first used in the U.S. in the 1890s but did not boost manufacturing productivity until the 1920s.10  Things now are a bit  9 See Hassan N."

" New business formation will surely play a role as well, as historically much of productivity growth has followed from the entry of firms starting with a clean slate—and the exit of firms that were slow to adapt.13 Labor Market Effects  As with all revolutionary technologies, when we turn our attention from productivity to the labor market, many express concern, focusing on jobs that may disappear, while others focus on which jobs will replace them."
" When the world switched from horsedrawn transport to motor vehicles, jobs for stable hands disappeared, but jobs for auto mechanics took their place.14  New technologies may displace some types of labor, but they can also raise the productivity and incomes of jobs they create or complement."

   - 7 - consumption that follow s may raise demand for labor overall.
"  Nonetheless,  the displacement effect might be concentrated and the productivity effect more diffuse ."
" For workers with a diverse skill set, and for workers with broad skills, like critical thinking and project management, the answer may well be “yes.”  For others, like the stable h and who was highly skilled in grooming horses, the answer may be “no.”17  15 See Leah Platt Boustan, Jiwon Choi, and David Clingingsmith  (2022), “Automation after the Assembly Line:  Computerized Machine Tools, Employment and Productivity in the United States,” NBER Working Paper Series 30400 (Cambridge, Mass.:  National Bureau of Economic Research, August; revised October), https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w30400/w30400.pdf ; David H."

" So the demand for STEM skills will be robust, as it has been throughout the information age, but AI technology may strengthen the rising demand for social skills as well.18  Some of the job titles will be brand new."
 Can productivity measures be improved to better capture how quickly AI is affecting the economy?
