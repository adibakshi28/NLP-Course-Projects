"  All these took place during the Great Moderation, the moderat ion being the decline in inflation and greater stability of output that occurred in much of the industrialized world."
 The Great Moderation was ascribed primarily to the switch in many countries to an inflation targeting approach to monetary policy.
" Nearly seven years after the failure of Lehman Brothers, the economies of the United States, Japan, countries within the Euro zone and other Eur opean countries who continue to use their own currencies, among them the United Kingdom, are still struggling to return to sustained growth, two percent inflation rates, and positive real central bank interest rates, and thus to leave behind the imprint of  the Great Recession."
" During the thirty years from 1985 to 2015, I have been involved in a variety of r oles in the management of crises, starting from the successful Israeli stabilization program of 1985, during which I was part of a small team advising then Secretary of State, George Shultz, and through the ongoing management of monetary policy in the Unit ed States                                                  1 See Jean Monnet (1976), Memoires , (Paris:  Fayard)."
"  In addition to lessons in the 1999 pa per relating to the Fund, it is clear from the conclusions presented in F5 (Keynesianism), F6 (bank and debt restructuring) and F7 (exchange rates) that the Fund had drawn the correct critical lessons on several of the                                                  2 Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research."
"  The 2011 paper reflects lessons both about policy – especially the critical role of the exchange rate for small open economies – and about crisis management, some of which I learned from my experience as Governor of th e Bank of Israel."
" I will focus on five major issues, leaving the most important – lessons relating to the financial system and its regulation and supervision – to the last.3 Lesson T1: Monetary policy at the Zero Lower Bound.4  Before the Great Recession, textbooks used to say that once the central bank interest rate had reached zero, monetary policy could not be made more expansionary – otherwise known as the liquidity trap."
"   - 5 - The argument was that the central bank could not reduce the interest rate below zero, since at a zero interest rate people could hold currency, on which the nominal interest rate is zero – which implies that the nominal interest rate could not decline below zero."
"   Almost immediately after the collapse of L ehman Brothers, the Fed began to undertake policies of Quantitative Easing (QE), in two forms: first, by buying assets of longer duration on a large scale, thus lowering longer term rates and making monetary policy effectively more expansionary; and second, by operating as market maker of last resort in markets that in the panic had seemed to stop working – for example, the commercial paper market."
" For insta nce, the recent inauguration of the ECB’s QE policy seemed to have an immediate effect not only on European interest rates, but also on longer -term rates in the United States."
" More recently, policymakers in several jurisdictions have discovered that zero i s not the lower bound on interest rates."
 We do not know how low the interest rate can g o – but do know that it can go below zero.
" Whether it can be reduced much below minus one percent remains to be seen – and many would prefer that we don’t go there.5                                                    5 There are fascinating issues about how a hypothetical monetary system without currency would operate, and what interest rates the central bank should attempt to control in such a situation –  but we will have to leave those issues for another occasion ."
"     - 6 - Lesson T2:   Monetary policy in normal times.6  In normal times, monetary policy should continue to be targeted at inflation and at output or employment.7  Typically, central bank laws also include some mention of financial stability as a responsibility of the central bank."
" On paper, the British approach of setting up nearly parallel committees for monetary policy and for macroprudential financial supervision and regulation appears to be a leading model."
"  Another issue that remains to be settled is that of the possible use of monetary policy, i.e. the interest rate, to deal with financial stability."
"  For instance, for some time several economists – including those working at the BIS – have been urging an in crease in the interest rate to restore risk premia to more normal levels."
 Most central bankers say they would prefer to use macroprudential tools rather than the interest rate for this purpose.
"  7 In most modern central bank laws, the central bank’s policy goals include both inflation and a measure of economic activity, although more often than not, the inflation goal is defined as more important than the output or employment goal."
"By contrast, the Fed has a dual mandate that gives equal weight to both inflation and employment."
 I believe that in pra ctice almost all central banks give approximately equal weight to their inflation and employment or output goals.
"    - 7 - possible use of the interest rate for this purpose, particularly when other tools appear to be lacking."
"  Lesson T3:  Active fiscal policy.8  There is a great deal of evidence that fiscal policy works well, almost everywhere, perhaps especially well when the interest rate is at its effective lower bound."
 This would mean a  temporary increase in the budget deficit while the spending takes place.
" That spending would have positive benefits – both an increase in aggregate demand as the infrastructure is built, and later an increase in aggregate supply as the positive impact of  the increase in the capital stock due to the investment in infrastructure comes into effect – that under current circumstances would outweigh the costs of its financing."
"  More generally, the case for more expansionary fiscal policy has always to take int o account the consequences of greater debt on future interest rates and on the flexibility of future fiscal policy."
 Confidence in the financial system and the growth of the economy has been profoundly shaken.
" Either way, there is now growing evidence that recessions lead not only to a lower level of future output, but also to a persistently lower growth rate."
 Some argue that it was the growth slowdown that caused   - 12 - the financial crisis.
Reaching the zero lower bound is not the end of expansionary monetary policy.
