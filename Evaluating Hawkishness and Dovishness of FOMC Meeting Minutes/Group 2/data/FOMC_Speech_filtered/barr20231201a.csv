" The banks’ poor interest rate and liquidity risk management triggered a crisis of confidence in their uninsured depositors , resulting in liquidity crises at these banks."
"  While there is more that regulators and supervisors can do to help to ensure banks’ interest rate risk manageme nt and capital bases are sufficiently calibrated to the risks of their business models, today I will focus most of my comments on liquidity risk management  and operational readiness for firms in the United States to utilize the Federal Reserve’s discount w indow."

" F irst, the discount window provides funding at a predictable interest rate, namely the primary credit rate , which  does not fluctuate daily, unlike interest rates on private sector liquidity sources ."
" This rate—along with that of the standing repo facility (SRF), also set at this level —should serve as a backstop rate to short -term market interest rates and provide eligible firms with certainty about the highest rate they will face to gain liqui dity against eligible assets at any given time."
 The discount window is also an important tool for monetary policy.
" To achieve  our monetary policy aims, the discount window needs to be readily usable :  if banks do not feel free to use the discount window when private sources of funding are more expensive, the discount window will not be an   - 4 - effective part of our monetary policy implementation toolkit ."
  - 6 - textbook case of mismanagement of interest rate and liquidity risk.
" In a wo rld in which  a bank run took place over a matter of weeks, it was reasonable to assume that a sufficient volume of the most liquid securities could be monetized to meet the demand for reserves  associated with deposit withdrawals ."
" An update on contingent liquidity readiness that the bank regulatory agencies published in July also makes clear that all of the agencies understand the importance of a bank’s readiness to make use of the discount window.10 The banks that failed because of the stres s event that began in March had access to, and utilized, the Federal Reserve’s discount window, and their failures were the result not of lack of access to the discount window but of basic mismanagement of interest rate and liquidity risk that left them effectively insolvent  in the eyes of uninsured depositors and unable to stem bank runs."
