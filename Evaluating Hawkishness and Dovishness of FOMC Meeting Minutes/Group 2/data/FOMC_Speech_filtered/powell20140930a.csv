 This paper argues that the ex traordinary response to the global financial crisis brought about a conflict between  debt management and monetary policy that should have been avoided through collaboration.
 The paper proposes a regime in which the Treasury and the Fed would cooperate aro und debt management at all times  and would fully collaborate in the case in which the monetary policy rate is pinned at the zero lower bound.
" First, the literature on financial stability and monetary policy is still in its infancy."
 There is no consensus that monetary policy (or debt management policy) should assume the kinds of roles assigned by the authors.
" My starting point would be that the Federal Open Market Committee did what it thought was appropriate ex ante to return the economy to full employment and stable prices, taking Treasury decis ions concerning debt management as exogenous."
 The independence of the Federal Reserveâ€™s monetary policy is highly valuable to society.
 There is considerable evidence that monetary policy independence leads to better macroeconomic outcomes.
" Any active collabo ration between debt management and monetary policy, even in a crisis, would risk calling into question that independence."
  The period after the Second World War during which debt management imposed requir ements upon monetary policy was marked by strains between the Treasury and the Fed and less than full independence for monetary policy.
