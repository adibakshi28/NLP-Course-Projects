" The Ph illips curve, a relationship between price or wage inflation and some measure of economic slack, has been the foundation of monetary policy for decades."
 A common way to estimate it is to look at output price inflation and the unemployment rate.
" One theor y, or story, is that as aggregate demand increases, labor demand will increase as well."
" Consequently, this story i mplies that the unemployment rate will fall."
" So, there is a negative relationship between price inflation and unemployment."
" So,  when aggregate demand increases, firms with set prices agree to supply the goods demanded at their current price s."
" As a result, inflation will arise from the firms that adjusted their prices."
" Meanwhile, higher employment will come from the sticky price firms , and, implicitly, higher employment goes along with lower unemployment."
" Once again, we obtain a negative relationship between output price inflation and unemployment."
 The slope of this relationship hinges on the fraction of firms adjusting their price s in response to the aggregate demand shock.
" In both these stories, expectations of future inflation play a critical role."
" In the sticky nominal wage story, workers will seek to maintain their real wages by set ting their wage demands based on what they think future inflation will be."
" In the New Keynesian model, firms set their output prices based on what they think aggregate price inflation will be in the future , and how often and at what pace they expect to change prices."
" Regardless of whether you think nominal wages are sticky or output prices ar e sticky, inflation expectations play a critical role in how unemployment responds to changes in the inflation rate."
" In either model, in the long run, nominal rigidities, or stickiness, disappear and expectatio ns of inflation converge to trend  - 3 - inflation."
" We all know that if you simply plot inflation against the une mployment rate over the p ast 50 years, you get a blob."
" Diehard believers in  the Phillips curve, the saltwater economists working on t he East and West coasts, argued that the data blob was the result of unstable inflation expectations."
" If inflation expectations were not stable, then the Phillips curve would shift around in such a way that you could not observe the true relationship in the data."
 What would cause inflation expectations to be unstable?
" If the central bank’s promises to keep inflation low were not credible, then private agents’ inflation expectations would be different than what the central bank promised, which in turn would cause the Phillips curve to shift around."
" As a result, the idea that the central bank had to make credible promises to keep inflation low became a bedrock principle of central banking that holds to this day."
"  - 4 - Inflation targeting provided a framework for making promises of low inflation credible , and since the late 1990s it has proved to be very successful in practice."
" W ith a central bank strongly committed to inflation targeting, promises to keep inflation at 2  percent  are credible in large part because the central bank is observed taking action to keep it near 2  percent , regardless of what is happening to the unemployme nt rate."
" As shown in figure 1, the Phillips curve was very flat for the 20 -plus years before the pandemic, consistent with the story that the Federal Reserve was credible at keeping inflation low.3 Then in the spring of 20 21, after more than a decade of hibernation, inflation came roaring back to life."
" As the economy recovered from the pandemic shutdowns, inflation increased each month of the year and was running at more than double the Fed’s 2 percent target throughout the latter half of 2021."
" Meanwhile, unemployment fell quite rapidly in 2021, from 6.3 percent at the start of the year to 3.9 percent in December, which was surprising given the long , slow recoveries after recent recessions."
" Based on the flatness of the Ph illips curve in recent decades, some commentators argued that unemployment would have to rise dramatically to bring inflation back down to 2 percent."
" Others argued that, based on analysis of the Beveridge curve, inflation could be brought  3 The FOMC began using an explicit 2 percent inflation target in 2012, but before then it was presumed to be targeting 2 percent."
"  - 5 - down without a s ignificant rise in unemployment, although this conjecture was not without controversy.4 But considering the data for 2021, as shown in figure 2, the Phillips curve suddenly looked relatively steep."
" Figure 3 shows that since January 2022, the Phillips curve is essentially vertical: T he unemployment rate has hovered around 3.6 percent , and inflation has varied from 7 percent (in June) to 5 .3 percent (in December)."
 Freshwater macroeconomists would once again argue that this difference shows the Phillips curve i s a statistical anomaly and should not be used as a foundational element guiding monetary policy.
 The first story relies on inflation expectations becoming unanchored and causing the short -run Phillips curve to shift around.
" There is  a vertical long -run Phillips curve anchored at U*, which is the rate of unemployment that occurs in the absence of price stickiness , and realized inflation is equal to inflation expectations."
 And there is a downward sloping short -run Phillips curve that shows a tradeoff between inflation and unemployment due to  4 See Figura and Waller (2022) for a discussion of how much unemployment necessarily needed to rise to bring inflation down toward the FOMC's 2 perc ent targe t.
 The short -run Phillips curve assumes a given level of inflation expectations.
" If inflation expectations increase, the short -run Phillips curv e shifts up."
" So,  if inflation expectations have increased in recent history, we would move from a lower to a higher Phillips  curve , as shown by the vertical shift up in the dots."
 An increase in the frequency of price changes steepens the short -run Phillips curve even if inflation expectations are well  anchored at 2 percent.
 What does this suggest about the relationship between inflation and labor market slack and the implications for monetary policy?
 The answer depends on data about inflation expectations and the frequency of output price changes.
"  5 Hall (2023) suggests that in times of high volatility of price determinants —costs and productivity —, like around the time of the pandemic, firms will adjust their prices mo re frequently than in other times."
"  - 7 - Figure 6 reproduces two charts on inflation expectations from the Federal Reserve’s March 2023 Monetary Policy Report.6  The charts show that the behavior of inflation expectations depends on the data one uses to measure those expectations.7  The left panel reports survey -based measures, while the right panel captures marketbased inflation expectations over a variety of time horizons."
"  On the left, we see that shorter -run inflation expectations followed observed inflation up and down in recent years, with a notable increase in 2021 before reversing course in 2022 and into early 2023."
 But inflation expectations over a longer horizon remained within the range of values seen in the years before the pandemic and appear broadly consistent with the F OMC’s longer -run 2 percent inflation objective.
" Similarly, in the right panel, market -based measures of longer -term inflation compensation are also broadly in line with readings seen in the years before the pandemic."
" So, overall, measures of longer -term inflation expectations have remained contained, while shorter -term expectations had moved up in 2021 and have partially reversed their earlier increases."
 These data suggest that changes in inflation can be associated with an unanchoring of inflation expec tations if we believe price -setting behavior is influenced by changes in shorter -term inflation expectations.
" Preliminary work by Montag and Villar  Vallenas (2023)  uses U.S. Consumer Price Index micro -data to examine  about 90,000 individual prices each month and determines  6 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2023), Monetary Policy Report  (Washington:  Board of Governors, March), https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/20230303_mprfullreport.pdf ."
 7 Gorodnichenko (2023) recently argued at the U.S. Monetary Policy Forum that inflation expectations of households and firms have become unanchored.
" Other than providing for  a fun academic discussion, what does this analysis mean for monetary policy makers?"
" If unanchored inflation expectations  were driving what looks like a shifting Phillips c urve, this would be extremely problematic for central banker s because it could  require dramatic actions by the FOMC to lower inflation expectations to shift the Phillips curve back down."
" I f this belief  is true, I take  some comfort in the fact that shortterm inflation expectations have moved down reasonably fast over the past year."
 A steep Phillips curve means inflation can be brought down quickly with relatively little pain in terms of higher unemployment.
 But we will need more data to conclude which story is right —which is what a data -dependent central bank does to implement appropriate monetary policy.
