"For release on delivery  10:05 a.m. EDT  April 5 , 2022 Variation in the Inflation Experience s of Households Remarks by  Lael Brainard  Member Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System  at the Spring 2022 Institute Research Conference  Opportunity and Inclusive Growth Institute Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis  Minneapolis, Minnesota (via webcast)  April 5 , 2022 It is a pleasure to join you to discuss differences in how households at different income levels experience inflation .1  I look forward to hearing from the panelists, who are doing important and interesting research on this topic."
"By law, the Federal Reserve is assigned the responsibility  to pursue price stability  and maximum employment."
" The Federal Open Market Committee (the Committee) has long recognized the connection between stable, low inflation and maximum employment."
" Forty years ago, Paul Volcker noted that the dual mandate isn’t an eitheror proposition and that runaway inflation “would be the greatest threat to the continuing growth of the economy… and ultimately, to employment.”2   Maximum employment and stable , low inflation benefit all Americans, but are particularly  important for low - and moderate -income families."
" The combination of good job opportunities and stable , low inflation provides purchasing power to fill up gas tanks and grocery carts  and pay housing and medical  costs, leaving room to build emergency  cushions and invest in education; retirement ; and, for some, small businesses."
" Indeed, the Employment Act of 1946 called on the federal government to promote “maximum employment, production, and purchasing power.”3  While national  data do not directly disaggregate the differential effects of inflation by household income groups, a variety of evidence suggests that lower -income households disproportionately feel the burden of high inflation."
" 3 See the Decla ration of Policy on page 1 of the Employment Act of 1946, available at https://fraser.stlouisfed.org/files/docs/historical/congressional/employment -act1946.pdf ."
 Arthur Burns noted in the late 1960s that “there can be little doubt that poor people…are the chief sufferers of inflation.
"”4   Today, inflation is very high, particularly for food and ga soline ."
" That is why getting inflation down is our most important task, while sustaining a recovery that includes everyone."
" In assessing inflation faced by American consum ers, economists and policymakers generally  rely on the change in t he consumer p rice index (CPI) or the change in the price index for  personal c onsumption e xpenditure s (PCE).5  Since January 2012, the Committee’s price -stability goal has been specifie d as a longer -run goal of 2 percent in terms of annual PCE inflation.6  Both CPI and PCE inflation metric s are  4 Quoted in John Palmer (1973) , Inflation, Unemployment , and Poverty  (Lexington, Mass.:  Lexington Books) , as referenced in Alan Blinder and Howard Esaki (1978) , “Macroeconomic Activity and Income Distribution in the Postwar United States ,” Review of Economics and Statistics , vol."
"5 CPI and PCE inflation generally move together but vary in important ways, including variations generated by differences in the scope of the purchases considered in the households ’ baskets, differences in the weights assigned to different categories of spending, and different formulas used to aggregate the underlying weighted price changes."
" For a recent comparison of CPI and PCE measures, see Noah Johnson (2017), “A Comparison of PCE and CPI:  Methodological Differences in U.S. Inflation Calculation and their Implications ,” BLS Statistical Survey Paper (Washington:  Bureau of Labor Statistics, November ), https://www.bls.gov/osmr/research -papers/2017/pdf/st170010.pdf ."
"6 The specific pricestability target of an inflation rate of 2 percent, as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditure s, was announced as part of the Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strateg y following the January 2012 Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) meeting."
" For additional information regarding the FOMC’s preference for using a PCE -based measure of inflation, see the discussion of the change from CPI to PCE inflation projections in the February 2000 Monetary Policy Report  at https://www.fed eralreserve.gov/boarddocs/hh/2000/february/fullreport.pdf#page=7 ."
"    - 3 - assembled from a collection of underlying elementary price indexes for narrow  subsets  of goods and services.7  The price changes each month for the goods and services in these subsets are combined into measures of overall inflation by calculating a weighted average of all these subindexes , where the weights are based on  average aggregate consumer expenditures  in each c ategory."
" This measure is particularly useful , for example,  in adjusting measures of overall expenditure for changes in prices to determine how much real growth has occurred between two periods ."
  U.S. Households H ave Different Inflation Experiences  Each household in the United States has a particular  consumption bundle whose prices and quantities combine to make up that household’s cost of living.
 T he change in such a cost -ofliving index would represent the average inflation experienced by U.S. households.
"   - 4 - living proportionally to their total expenditure .8  Since  lower -income households represent a relatively smaller sh are of overall expenditure, the inflation associated with their consumption baskets is  underrepresented in the official consumer price ind exes."
"It would  be useful  to have data about consumer inflation broken out by demographic groups, similar to  labor market and personal -income data, in order to assess the differential effect of inflation across different groups of households.9  U.S. statistical agencies do not collect the information needed to  accurately  assess inflation at a household level , and it  would require a large change in the way these agencies go about their work  to do so."
" Nonetheless, recent research has begun to assess variation in the ways different households experience inflation."
  Households at different income levels could experience differential inflation effects for several reasons:  Consumption shares  could differ systematically for low - and highincome households ; the goods and services within each consumption category could differ; the ability to substitute for lowerprice d alternative s of the same item  could differ ; and prices paid  for the same good could differ systematically due to differences in access.
"First, low - and moderate -income  households could experience  inflation that diverges from the average  because their  consumption baskets differ systematically from the average."
"9 See Austan Goolsbee (2021), “The Missing Data in the Inflation Debate,” New York Times , December 30, https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/30/opinion/inflation -economy -biden -inequality.html ."
  -5 - necessities —more than double the 31 percent of income spent by higherincome households on these categories.11   Several studies have found that the consumption baskets of lowerincome households have experienced higherthan- average inflation rat es over time.
" A 2021 working paper by BLS staff based on data from 2003 to 2018 found that a price index reflecting the consumption basket for households in the lowestincome quartile grew faster than the overall CPI, while a price index reflecting the consumption basket for households in the highest -income quartile grew more slowly  than the overall CPI.12  A 2015 BLS study found a similar result using data  from 1982 to 2014.13  Of course, the rec ent sharp increases in inflation may have affected th e 11 The values for the share of income spent in each category were constructed using microdata from the 2020 Consumer Expenditure Interview Survey (CEX)."
" During the period examined, the rate of overall consumer inflation was 2.78 percent, as measured by the regular CPI -U for All Items."
" As a result, they may miss additional sources of variation in the inflation rates experienced by households at different income levels."
" The demand and supply dynamics for those products are likely quite different, meaning that their relative price dynamics are poorly described by a single index."
"10, https://www.bls.gov/opub/btn/volume -4/the -costof-basic -necessi tieshas-risen -slightly -more -thaninflation -overthe-last30-years.htm ."
" Finally , beyond the variation in inflation that comes from households buying different goods, research also show s that differences in inflation can result from households paying different prices for identical goods."
" Using transaction -level data, researchers found t hat almost two -thirds of the variation  in inflation across households comes from differences in prices paid for identical goods, with only  about one -third coming from differences in the mix of goods within broad categories.14  As a result of  these differences, households with low er incomes, more household members, or older household heads experienced higher inflation on average."
"  In addition, evidence suggests that inflation could be lower for items purchased online rather than from brick -andmortar stores , suggesting that households who do not have full access to online shopping options could face a higher cost of living ."
" One study 14 See Greg Kaplan and Sam Schulhofer -Wohl  (2017) , “Inflation at the Household Level, ” Journal of Monetary Economics , vol."
" For a sample of 500 million transactions by about 50,000 U.S. households from 2004 to 2013 , the authors found that over the nine years from the third quarter of 2004 through the third quarter of 2013, average inflation cumulates to 33  percent  for households with incomes below $20,000  but to just 25  percent  for households with incomes above $100,000."
"    This finding does not hold for housing, where a recent study found that housing inflation tends to be relatively similar across income quintiles, even though the share of income spent on housing varies considerably by income group."
" See table 2 and the related discussion in Daryl Larsen and Raven Malloy  (2021) , “Differences in Rent Growth by Income 1985 -2019 and Implications for Real Income Inequality ,” FEDS Notes  (Washington:  Board of  Governors of the Federal Reserve System,  November 5 ), https://doi.org/10.17016/2380 -7172.3006."
"  - 8 - of online transactions made between 2014 and 2017 found that  online inflation averaged more than 1 percentage point per year lower than the equivalent CPI measure of the relevant product categories.15   We are only beginning to unders tand the ways in which inflation experiences vary from household to household, how this variation correlates with income and demographic information, and how these divergent inflation experiences change over time.16  This developing area of research  will b enefit from conferences like this one  that help expand the frontier of our knowledge about the heterogeneity of experienced inflation."
  Implications for the Outlook and Policy  High inflation places  a burden on working families who are concerned about  how far their paychecks will stretch  as well as seniors living on fixed incomes .
 So now let me turn briefly to what we are seeing on inflation and the outlook for jobs and growth.
Headline PCE inflation for February came in at 6.4 percent on a 12month basis.
" Food and energy account for  an outsized one -fourth share of th is high level of  inflation  and also  constitute an outsized share of expenditure for low erincome Americans, who  15 The study used a matched set of entry -level item categories to create a digital price index (DPI) to compare with the equivalent CPI measure and found that overall DPI inflation is more than 1 percentage point per year lower than CPI inflation  in those categories ."
"Broken out by m ajor groups, inflation was lower in the DPI than in the equivalent CPI in every category other than medicine and medical supplies."
" See Austan Goolsbee and Peter Klenow (2018), “Internet Rising, Prices Falling:  Measuring Inflation in a World of E -Commerce ,” AEA Papers and Proceedings , vol."
"    16 For example, a recent study also suggests that the differential rates of inflation between low - and high -income households varies over the cycle:  The gap between the inflation associated with goods purchased by lower -income households relative to higher -income households rises during recessions and narrows during recoveries ."
" See also Jacob Orchar d (2022), “Cyclical Demand Shifts and Cost of Living Inequality,” SSRN Working Paper (Rochester, NY:  SSRN, February 12), https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4033572."
"  -9 - spend 26 percent of their income on food at home and transportation, compared with 9 percent for high -income Americans .17   Core inflation is also elevated, and  inflationary pressures have been broadening out."
" Housing contributed about onetenth of total P CE inflation in February and is  the single greatest category of expenditures by far for lowerincome Americans , who spend 45 percent of their income on housing, compared to 18 percent for highincome Americans.18  Durable goods inflation , particularly in a utos, account ed for slightly more than onefifth of total PCE inflation  in February, representing a much greater contribution to inflation  than was the case pre -pandemic."
 High durable goods inflation reflect s pandemicrelated supply constraints as well as persistently elevated demand associated with the pandemic.
" I will be carefully monitoring the extent to which demand rotates back to services and away from durable goods, where it has remained consistently above prepandemic levels, and the extent to which the services sector is able to  absorb higher demand without generating undue inflationary pressure."
 The global commodity supply shock associa ted with Russia’s actions  skews inflation risks to the upside and is expected to exacerbate high prices for gasoline and food as well as supply chain bottlenecks in goods sectors.
 -10 - These g eopolitical events also pose downside risks to  growth.
" That said , the U.S. economy enter ed this period of uncertainty with considerable momentum in demand and a strong labor market."
" As of the March labor report, payroll employment has increased at a pace of 600,000 jobs per month over the p ast six  months, and  the unemployment rate has fallen by a percentage point  over that period and is now close to its prepandemic level."
" An  increase in  labor supply associated with diminish ing pandemic constraints combined with a moderation in demand associated with tightening financial conditions, slowing foreign growth, and a large decrease in fiscal support could be expected to  reduce imbalances later in the year."
 It is of paramoun t importance to get inflation down.
" Accordingly, the Committee will continue  tightening monetary policy methodically through a series of interest rate increases and  by starting to reduce the balance sheet at a rapid pace as soon as our May meeting ."
 The reduction in the balance sheet will contribute to monetary policy tightening over and above the expected increases in the policy rate reflected in market pricing and the Committee’s Summary of Economic P rojections.
"  I expect  the -11 - combined effect  of rate increases and balance sheet reduction to bring the stance of policy to a more  neutral position later this year, with the full extent of additional tightening over time dependent on how the outlook for inflation and employment evolves."
" For today, every indicator of longerterm inflation expectations lies within  the range of historical values consistent with our 2 percent target ."
 The Committee is prepared to take stronger action if indicators of inflation and inflation expectations indicate  that such action is warranted .
" We are committed to bringing  inflation back down to its  2 percent target, recognizing that stable low inflation  is vital to maintain ing a strong economy and a labor market that works for everyone."
