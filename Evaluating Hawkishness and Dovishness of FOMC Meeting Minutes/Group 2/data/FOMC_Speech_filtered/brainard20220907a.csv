"For release on delivery 12:40 p.m. EDT  September 7, 2022 Bringing Inflation Down Remarks by  Lael Brainard  Vice Chair  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System  at The Clearing House and Bank Policy Institute  2022 Annual Conference  New York, New York  September 7, 2022  Over the past year, inflation has been very high in the United States and around the world (figure 1)."
" High inflation imposes costs on all households, and especially low -income households."
" The multiple waves of the pandemic , combined with Russia’s war against Ukraine , unleashed a series of supply shocks hitting goods, labor, and commodities that,  in combination with strong demand,  have contributed to ongoing high inflation."
" With a series of inflationary supply shocks, it is especially important to guard against the risk that households and businesses could start to expect inflation to remain above 2 percent in the longer run, which would make it much more c hallenging to bring inflation back down to our target."
" The Federal Reserve is taking action  to keep inflation expectations anchored and bring inflation back to 2 percent  over time.1 While last year’s rapid pace of economic growth was boosted by accommoda tive fiscal and monetary policy as well as reopening, demand has moderated this year as those tailwinds have abated."
 A sizable fiscal drag on output growth alongside a sharp tightening in financial conditions has contributed to a slowing in activity.
" 2 For comparison, growth in the alternative activity measure of real gross domestic income (GDI) has come in just below potential in the first half of the ye ar."

 - 2 - The concentration of strong consumer spending in supply -constrained sectors has contributed to high inflation.
" Real spending on goods has declined modestly in each of the past two quarters, while real spending on services has expanded at about half its 2021 growth rate."
" In addition to the fiscal drag and tighter financial conditions, high inflation —particularly in food and gas prices —has restrained consumer  spending by reducing real purchasing power."
" While price increases in food and energy are weighing on discretionary spending by all Americans, they are  especially hard on low -income families , who spend three -fourths of their income on necessities such as food, gas, and shelter —more than double the 31 percent for highincome households.3 Since the very elevated prices at the pump in June, the nationwide average price of a gallon of regular unleaded gasoline has declined every day throughout July and August , most recently falling below $4 a gallon , according to the American Automobile Association .4  The rise and fall of gasoline prices played a major role in the dynamics of inflation over the summer, contributing 0.4 percentage point to month -over -month personal consumption expenditure s (PCE) inflation in June and subtracting 0.2 percentage point in July."
" This 0.6 percentage point swing in the contribution of gasoline  3 For more details on this difference and further information on how the effect of inflation varies across households, see Lael Brainard (202 2), “Variation in the Inflation Experiences of Households ,” speech delivered at the  Spring 2022 Institute Research C onference, Opportunity and Inclusive Growth Institute, Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis,  Minneapolis , April 5, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/braina rd20220405a.htm ."

  Core inflation —inflation excluding volatile food and energy prices —also moderated in July.
 C ore goods PCE inflation decelerated to 0.
"1 percent month -over -month in July after averaging 0.5 percent in May and June.6  While the moderation in monthly inflation is welcome, it will be necessary to see several months of low monthly inflation readings to be confident that inflation is moving back down to 2 percent."
"  How long it takes to move inflation back dow n to 2 percent will depend on a combination of continued easing in supply constraints, slower demand growth, and lower markups, against the backdrop of anchored expectations."
" In addition, labor force participation showed a welcome increase in the August employment data, particularly in the boost in participation among  5 See, for example, Kim Chipman and Tarso Veloso Ribeiro (2022), “Dried -Out Farms from China to Iow a Will Pressure Food Prices,” Bloomberg, August 27."
 Last year’s rapid demand growth in the face of supply constraints led to product shortages in some areas of the economy and high margins for many firms.
"  - 5 - sensitive demand cooling, there may  soon  be pressures to reduce vehicle margins and prices in order to move the higher volume of cars being produced off dealer  lots."
" With g ross retail margins amounting to about 30 percent of sales, a reduction in currently elevated margins could make an important contribution to reduced inflation pressures  in consumer goods ."
"  Labor demand continues to exhibit considerable strength, which is hard to reconcile with the more downbeat t one of activity."
" Year -todate through August, payroll employment has increased by about 3½ million jobs, a surprisingly strong increase given the decelerating spending and declining GDP over the first half of the year."
" The unemployment rate has fallen, on net, from 4 percent in January to 3.7 percent in August."
" Possibly the strongest indications that the labor market is tight were the firstand second -quarter readings of the employment cost index (ECI), which point to strong and broadbased growth in total hourly compensation."
 The 6.3 percent reading for the ECI in the second quarter was the largest annualized quarterly growth in compensation under this metric since 1982.
"  The deceleration in economic activity thus far this year has coincided with only a slight easing in job openings, on net, si nce their peak in March."
 Businesses  that experienc ed unprecedented challenges restoring or ex panding their workforces following the pandemic  may be more inclined to make greater efforts to retain their employees  than they normally would when facing a slowdown in economic activity.
" This may mean that slowing aggregate demand will lead to a smaller  increase in unemployment than we have seen in previous recessions, but it is too early to draw any definitive conclusions, and I will be monitoring a variety of labor market indicators closely.8   As we follow through on our plan to move monetary policy to an appropriately restrictive stance, the effect of the increased policy rate and pace of balance sheet shrinkage should put downward pressure on aggregate demand, particularly in interest -sensitive sectors like housing."
 The rapid tightening in monetary policy is also reflected in a significant increase in the projected real short rate:  The Blue Chip Financial Forecasts has the expected short rate moving above 0.5 percent in real terms to a significantly high er level than prepandemic within the next 12 months (figure 6).
 The disinflationary process here at home should be reinforced by weak er demand and tightening in many other countries.
" The rapidity of the tightening cycle and its global nature, as well as the uncertainty around the pace at which the effects of tighte r financ ial conditions are working their way through aggregate demand , create risks associated with overtightening."
" Following a lengthy sequence of adverse supply shocks to goods, labor, and commodities that , in combination with strong demand,  drove  inflation to multidecade highs, we must maintain a risk -management posture to defend the  inflation expectations anchor.9  While we have no control over the supply shocks to food,  energy, labor, or semiconductors, we have both the capacity and the responsibility to maintain anchored inflation expectations  and price stability ."

  - 8 - We are in this for as long as it takes to get inflation down.
" As of this month, the  maximum monthly  reduction in the balance sheet will be  nearly double the level  of the previous cycle .10  Together, the increase in the polic y rate and the reduction in the balance sheet should help bring demand into alignment with supply."
 Monetary policy will need to be restrictive for some time to provide confidence that inflation is moving down to target .
" While the precise course of action will depend on the evolution of the outlook , I am confident we will achieve a return to 2 percent inflation."
