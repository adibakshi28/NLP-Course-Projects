"Waller   Member     Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at  “Recent Fiscal and Monetary Policy:   Implications for U.S. and Israeli Real Estate Markets,”   a conference sponsored by the Alrov Institute for Real Estate Research, the Coller School of Management,  the New Jersey -Israel Commission, an d the Rutgers Center for Real Estate     (via webcast)           March 24, 2022  Thank you,  Debra, and thank you to the Alrov Institute and the Ru tgers  Center for Real Estate  for the invitation to be part of this conference ."
"     As a member of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC),  I watch real estate trends pretty closely because they have a bearing on our pursuit of maximum employment and price stability."
 Real estate also matters for inflation.
"  Housing services represent about 15 percent of the Personal Consumption Expenditure price index , and i t represents an even larger share of another wellknown inflation yardstick, the Consumer Price Index."
" Let’s start with rents, because rents give us the most direct information on  how affordable  housing services  are.2  Early in the p andemic , rent growth slowed as demand dropped to live in dense areas where rental housing tends to be concentrated while some people, especially young adults, moved in with family and friends ."
" Based on various measures of asking rents, s ome recent research suggests that the rate of rent in flation  in the CPI will double in 2022.3  If so, rent as a component of inflation  will accelerate, which has implications for monetary policy."

 Monetary policy actions have had a noticeable effect  on mortgage rates.
" This setting and forward guidance on the target range put downward pressure on both shorter and longer -term interest rates , including mortgage rates ."
" Specifically, communications at the end of 2021 indicated  that, with substantial recovery of the economy  and elevated inflation , monetary policy accommodation w ould begin to unwind."
 - 6 - tells us that some combination of growing demand and limits on housing supply has driven this change.
 Demand for housing space has been especially strong during the pa ndemic .
" Lockdowns as well as remote work and school may have spurred people to seek homes with more space, leading to an increase in demand for larger and otherwise better homes .5  In fact, t he average size of new singlefamily homes increased in 2021, reversing a downward trend from 2015 through 2020."
" Meanwhile, changes in household formation may have been contributing to increases in housing demand over the past year or so ."
" The pandemic -related changes in demand for housing, rented and owned, coincided with a longer -run increase in demand to live in certain parts of the country."
" For the past several d ecades, demand for living in cities with high -paying jobs and many urban amenities has surged, pushing up housing costs  in these areas ."
" Among metro areas in the top quartile of local housing demand, population increased 80 percent , and single -family home  prices rose more than 110 percent from 1990 to 2019 after adjusting for inflation .6  For the nation as a whole, population only increased 32 percent and house prices rose 59 percent."
"  While this trend towards urban living supported commercial real estate demand and prices for years, post pandemic, more people are working at home and there  has been a corresponding decline in demand for office space, particularly in downtown areas."
 While low C OVID case rates may induce some worker s to return to the  6 Local housing demand is estimated as the sum of the growth rate in the population and the growth rate of infla tion -adjusted home prices from 1990 to 2019.
That’s the demand side.
" One estimate is that the current growth in the supply of new housing units i s about 100,000 less per year that would be needed to support trend increases in demand from household formation and replacement of depreciating units.7  Supply adjusts to changes in the economy more slowly than demand because of the time it takes to plan  and build."
" Even with increased materials costs , suppliers have been unable to keep up with demand."
9 This mea s ure of labor market tightness is the job openings rate divided by the unemployment rate.
" Probably not by accident, these regulations have tended to be more restrictive in areas with high housing demand."
" While some  local regulations have been changed  to allow  more housing construction in high demand areas, the effects  will take time, and it remains to be seen whether the increases in supply created by these regulatory changes will be enough to satisfy local demand."
" I’ve mentioned the impact of monetary policy on housing markets, now let me touch on the role of fiscal policy."
" The rescue plan passed by the Congress in 2020, consisting of stimulus payments, grants to small businesses to maintain their payrolls, and supplemental unemployment benefits, surely helped many people who lost income during the pandemic continue to pay their rent and mortgage s."
"  - 11 - the substantive supply and demand issues I have detailed—not by excessive leverage, looser underwrit ing standards, or financial speculation."
" The demand for extra space at home might level off , or even reverse if peopl e start to spend more time away from home again as the pandemic ease s."
 The strong demand to live in cities with tight housing supply is likely to continue.
" Regulatory supply constraints may be starting  to ease in some places, but they will persist and continue to limit home building in  many high demand areas."
" And while prices for lumber and other materials may come down , with the economy already at maximum employment and experiencing a shortage of skilled workers, labor supply will likely continue to hold back the pace of new construction ."
" With housing  costs gaining an ever -larger weight in the inflation Americans experience, I will be looking even more closely at real estate to  judge the appropriate stance of monetary policy."
