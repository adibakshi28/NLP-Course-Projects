" The decline in turnover is not driven by a reduction in trading volume, but it is the result of a robust growth of the denominator, debt outstanding."
" Flash events  In addition , recent flash events --such as t he sharp movement in Treasury prices on October 15, 2014 ; the rapid r ise and decline of the euro -dollar exchange rate on March 18, 2015 ; 6 and the swing in sterling on October 7, 2016 --have led some to assert that market liquidity has become less resilient."
"  Researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York have argued t hat spikes in volatility and sudden declines in liquidity have become more frequent in both Treasury and equity markets.7  The Commodity Futures Tradi ng Commission also points out that flash events  are more common now.8  Market participants sugges t that the rapid growth in high -frequency trading in equity, foreign exchange, and U.S. Treasury markets, along with broader concerns about less resilient liquidity, potentially explains these flash events."
" On balance, the evidence presented in these two figures seems to suggest that market liquidity has not deteriorated in recent years --subject , of course , to the caveat I just discussed about the possibility that our measures of bid -ask spreads could be distorted by the increasing role of investors as suppliers rather than demanders of liquidity.11 As an aside, the market liquidity figures shown are only for the corporate bond market, but we see similar patterns in the  equity  and Treasury markets.12  That is, we do not find convincing evidence that liquidity has markedly declined in those markets ."
