"  For release on delivery  4:00 p.m. EST  February 14, 2024          The Intersection of Monetary Policy, Market  Functioning, and Liquidity  Risk Management     Remarks by   Michael S."
" As you might expect, I was a little busy in March 2023 , and I will share some thoughts on lessons learned from th e stress  in the banking system  at that time , in particular what we have learned in terms of liquidity risk management .1   But first, I  will start by discussing  recent economic developments  and the implications for monetary policy."
" Perhaps  like many of you, at the start of 2023 I had projected that tighter monetary policy would cause a slowdown in  both inflation and  economic activity."
"At the same time, I also worried that inflation might remain elevated , even if we had weaker economic activity , as supply chain problems and job -matching challenges continued to be prominent elements of the pandemic’s disruption to the operation of our economy."
" I am glad to say that those worries did not come to pass , in part due to the official sector response to the banking stress , sound monetary policy, and a healing economy ."
" - 2 -  Economic activity expanded at  a solid pac e, the labor market remained strong, and  inflation came down significantly ."
"   Disinflation  and a growing economy  The current mix of outcomes we are experiencing  would  have seemed improbable one year ago, and we might ask , how did we end up with disinflation and a n economy  with brisk growth ?"
" During the second quarter of 2020, the unemployment rate jumped to a high of 14.8 percent and gross domestic product plunged at a 28 percent annual pace."
" Once the economy  restarted, demand rebounded quickly , while supply was hampered by supply  chain difficulties ."
" These supply snags  were compounded enormously by a shift in demand away from in -person services and toward goods, which generally have a larger exposure to shipping and supply chain problems ."
" As supply has improved, labor demand has cooled , but this cooling has manifested lar gely in a reduction in job vacancies, rather than layoffs."
 The improvements in labor supply and labor market f unctioning have allowed  the unemployment rate to hold steady at a low level.
" The strong labor market  has broadly improved the lives of Americans, and particularly so for groups that have long suffered significantly higher unemployment levels and whose jobless rates respond more forcefully to the business cycle ."
 Improvements in productivity  Another key part of the story in the postpandemic healing of our economy has been the growth of p roductivity.
" While measure s of productivity tend to be  volatile, productivity  growth has picked up  in the past year ."
" Increased productivity is , in part , likely coming from components that will continue to yield improvements , such as the integration of new technology , new ways of working,  and the large increases in new business formation."
" Growth in new businesses has been found to lead to productivity gains, likely  because  new entr ants innovate, and legacy firms must also innovate  to compete with new entrants."
" These increases in productivity are also consistent with real wage gains, one measure of rising living standards ."
 - 4 -  The net result of all this healing  of the economy is that growth has been robust even as  upward pressure on inflation  has diminished .
" Higher interest rates  have helped to restrain  demand , giving supply the opportunity to catch up ."
 Monetary policy has also anchor ed inflation expectations .
" Longer -term inflation expectations have stayed anchored , and shorter -term expectations have fallen ."
 The F ederal Open Market Committee ’s (FOMC)  preferred inflation gauge has fallen from a peak of 7.1 percent in June 2022 to 2.6 percent in December  2023 .
 We have made this progress while unemployment has remained near a 50year low .
" We are always assessing risks on the horizon , including the risk of an economic slowdown that could reduce employment , or the risk that inflation does not stay on its path of sustainably return ing to 2 percent."
"  As Chair Powell indicated in his most recent press conference, my FOMC colleagues and I are confident we are on a path  to 2 percent inflation , but we need to see  continued good  data before we can begin the process of reducing  the federal funds rate ."
" January’s report on consumer pr ice index inflation is a reminder that the path back to 2  percent inflation may be a bumpy one.i Given the limited historical experience with the growth and inflation dynamics we currently face, and no modern experience of emerging from a global pandemic, we have yet another reason to proceed carefully , as we have been doing."
" As interest rates increase and the value of HTM securities goes down, banks that account for them at amortized cost do not have to reflect the decline in market value  on their balance sheet s."
" - 8 -  manage to higher reserve levels than they did pre -COVID , with several  citing the March liquidity stress as a significant driver.6      Right now, the Federal Reserve is implementing monetary policy with plentiful reserves in the system , even  as we continue to run down the balance sheet with sizable securities redemptions every month."
" The FOMC reiterated  in May 2022 that it plans to  operate monetary policy with an ample -reserve s regime  over time.7  As many market comment ators have pointed out, it may be difficult to determine what level of reserves is consistent with “ample .”  The market dynamics from September 2019  illustrate this;  when repo rates spiked and these pressures spill ed over into the fed eral funds market , the Fed had to rapidly ramp up operations to add reserves to the banking system ."
" Note that the original statement was in January 2019; see Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2019), “ Statement Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation and Balance Sheet Normalization, ” press release, January 30,  https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20190130c.htm ."
"8 Both the standing repo facility  and the FIMA repo facility were established in July 2021 ; see Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2021), “Statement Regarding Repurchase Agreement  - 9 -  pleased to see that there has been a steady growth  in the number of firms signed up for the facility, and that current bank counterparties to the facility engage in regular testing as a part of maintaining access."
 Economic healing is helping us to lower inflation while growth remains solid.
