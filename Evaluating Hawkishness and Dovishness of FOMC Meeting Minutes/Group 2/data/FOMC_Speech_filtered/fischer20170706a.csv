"For release on delivery  7:30 p.m. EDT   July 6, 2017         Government Policy and Labor Productivity     Remarks by   Stanley Fischer   Vice Chair man  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at  “Washington Transformation?"
" Politics, Policies, Prospects,” a forum sponsored by the  Summer Institute of Martha’s Vineyard Hebrew Center   Vineyard Haven, Massachusetts         July 6, 2017    I want to talk tonight about labor productivity growth."
 Labor productivity is the amount of goods and services produced per hour spent on the job.
" Increases in labor productivity --again, that’s the amount of goods and services produced per hour on the job--are a fundamental factor in determining how f ast the economy grows, and how fast the average standard of living grows."
" And productivity growth can be influenced by government policy, about which I also want to say a few words.1   Labor productivity growth varies a lot from year to year, but it is possible to discern longer historical periods with high or low productivity growth, as shown i n figure  1."
" For example, labor productivity rose at an average annual rate of 31/4 percent from 1948 to 1973, whereas in the period 1974 to 2016, the average growth rate of productivity was about 1.7 percent ."
" That is to say that, with the important exception of the information technology (IT)  boom beginning in the mid -1990s, the U.S. economy has been in a low -productivity growth period since 1974."
  How much does productivity growth matter?
" That is a pleasure, a n honor, a joy, and something of a difficulty for anyone wanting to talk about productivity and its growth in the presence of the master."
  The reason the rate of productivity growth matters so much is that it is a basic determinant of the rate of growth o f average income per capita over long periods.2  To                                                  1 I am grateful to David Byrne  of the Federal Reserve Board for his  assistance.
 2 One needs also to recognize that changes in either the average workweek or the employment to population ratio may damp or augment the effect of labor productivity on GDP per capita.
 A good rule of thumb for calculating the time it takes labor productivity (or anything e lse that is growing) to double can be calculated by dividing 70 by the growth rate.
 When labor productivity was growing at 31/4 percent per year--during the 25 years from 1948 to 1973--it took 22 years for labor productivity to double.
" Looking a gain at Figure 1, in the 42 years from 1974 to 2016, when labor productivity was growing on average at a rate of 13/4 percent, it would have taken approximately 41 years for labor productivity to double."
" It has certainly changed our lives to some extent, and there is likely some u nderestimation of productivity growth in the official data."
" But to figure out whether the current degree of data bias has reduced estimated growth, we have to ask not whether there is bias, but whether the bias has increased."
" To a first approximation, one could assume that the rate of bias is constant, and does not account for the estimated decline in productivity growth and that we should not dismiss the slowdown as an artifact of measurement difficulties3  That is the conclusion most researchers reach, but the data issue is not settled."
"  - 3 - before the increase in productivity growth of 1996 -2003, “the computer is everywhere except in the growth data.”  And there are serious researchers who have made serious arguments that we  will soon be seeing more rapid growth in the productivity data."
"  Factors determining productivity growth  Clearly, a key question for  economic forecasters , and even more so for U.S. citizens, and indeed for the entire global economy, is whether we should anticipate a return of the more rapid productivity g ains experienced in the IT boom  and for the quarter century after the end of World War II , or should instead resign ourselves to tepid economic growth in future years."
 And a central policy issue is whether government policies can help push the economy toward a higher -productivity regime.
"  In this context, it is useful to think of labor productivity growth as coming from three sources , as shown i n figure  2."
" First, greater investment by firms in tangible equipment and structures, as well as “intangible” investments such as software and product designs, raise labor productivity."
" It  is noteworthy that most of the recent drop in productivity is due to a lower contribution from innovation, although weaker investment has played a role as well."
 The contribution to labor productivity from labor quality has changed ver y little.
" Some observers believe that we  have exhausted the low -hanging fruit on the productivity tree and, in particular, that efficiency gains from the use of IT have run their course.4  Other observers argue that we can reach fruit higher on the tree with each passing year."
" One possibility is that we  are in a productivity lull while firms reorganize to exploit the latest innovations; it took decades before the full benefits of the steam engine, electrification, and computers were seen.6 One way to ensure the vigor of innovation is to support research and development (R&D), and here the recent record is mixed ."
"83 ) considers advances in research methods and tools and concludes that “the indirect effects of science on productivity through the tools it provides scientific research may dwarf the direct effects in the long r un.” 6 David (1990) cautions that the effect of general -purpose technologies, such as electricity and electronic computing, can take decades to fully unfold."
" The applied research built on this basic research ultimately yields productivity gains far into the future.7  Consequently, the decline in government -funded R&D is disturbing."
" To raise productivity and economic well -being, firms must adopt innovations that emerge from R&D as quickly as possible."
" Investment  In recent years, the contribution to labor productivity growth  from  investment  has declined ."
" Business fixed investment rose roughly 21/2 percent per year , on average, from 2004 to 2016, compared with about 5 percent from 1996 to 2003.9  Some bright                                                  7  Mohnen and Hall (2013) survey the empirical literature pointing to a link between R&D and productivity."
" 8 Decker and others  (2016) highlig ht the decline in entrepreneurship and worker  mobility; Andrews, Criscuolo, and Gal  (2015 ) emphasizes  that productivity for firms at the global frontier continues to advance rapidly even as global aggregate productivity growth has slowed."
" 9 Pinto and Tevlin (2014) note that in the context of a long -run growth model, a slow pace of investment is not surprising in light of the slow growth in effective labor inputs --which equal s the sum of labor quality and total factor productivity growth."
  Government investment can be an important source of productivity growth as well.
" For example, the interstate highway system is credited with boosting productivity in the 1950s and 1960s.11  That highway system and many other federally  supported roadways, waterways, and structures have been neglected in recent years."
" Indeed, real infrastructure spending (that is, adjusting for inflation) has fallen nearly 1 percent per year since 2005.12  This area of government investment deserves more attention."
  - 7 - Labor Quality Also important to raising labor productivity is investment in human capita l--workers’ knowledge and skills.
 Workers too ill to perform at their potential represent lost productivity and welfare for society as a whole.
" Concluding remarks  To conclude , we return to the basic question:  How much does productivity growth matter?"
" If labor productivity grows an average of 2 percent per year, average living standards for our children’s generation will be twice what we experienced."
" If labor productivity grows an average of 1 percent per year , the difference is dramatic:   Living standards will take two generations to double.16   But f ortunately, when it comes to productivity, we are not simply consig ned to luck or to fate."
 Governments can take sensible actions to promote more rapid productivity growth.
" R easonable people can disagree about the right way forward, but if we as a society are to succeed , we need to follow policies that will support and advance productivity growth."
" 16 To be precise, this illustrative calculation assumes that the average workweek and  the employment -topopulation ratio are unchanged ."
