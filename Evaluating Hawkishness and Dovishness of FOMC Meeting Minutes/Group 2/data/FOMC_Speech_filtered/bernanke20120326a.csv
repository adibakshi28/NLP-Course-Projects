" We have seen some positive signs  on the jobs front  recently , including a pickup in monthly payroll gains and a notable decline in the unemployment rate."
"Importantly, d espite the recent improvement , the job market remains far from normal; for example, the number of people working and total hours worked  are still significantly  below pre -crisis peaks, while the unemployment rate remains well above what most economists judge to be its long -run sustainable level."
" Long -term unemployment is particularly costly to those directly affected , of course."
" B ut in addition , because of its negative effects on workers’ skills and attachment to the labor force , long -term unemployment may ultimately  reduce the productive capacity of our economy."
" The debate about how best to address long -term unemployment raises a nother important question:  Is the current high level of long -term unemployment primarily the result of cyclical factors, such as insufficient aggregate demand, or of structural changes, such as a worsening mismatch between workers’ skills and employers’ r equirements?"
" If cyclical factors predominate, then policies that support a broader economic recovery should  be effective in addressing long -term unemployment as well; if the causes are structural, then other policy tools will be needed."
" I will argue toda y that, while both cyclical and structural f orces  have doubtless contributed to the increase in long -term - 2 -   unemployment, the continued weakness in aggregate demand  is likely the predomina nt factor ."
" Consequently, the Federal Reserve’s accommodative monetary  policies, by providing support for demand and for the recovery, should help , over time, to  reduce longterm unemployment as well."
" Recent Labor Market Developments  As background for my discussion, let me provide a brief review of recent  job market indicat ors."
" Private payroll employment ( figure 1) increased by nearly 250,000 jobs per month, on average, in the three months ending in February,  and by about 190,000 jobs per month , on averag e, over the  past 12 months."
"  Together with a lengthening of the average workweek, these employment gains have contributed to a significant  increase in aggregate hours worked  (figure 2)."
The government  estimates payroll employment --the number of jobs --from a survey of businesses --the establishment survey .
" A monthly survey of about 60,000 households, which provides the data needed to construct the national unemployment rate, - 3 -   offers an alternative  estimate of the number of jobs."
"  Employment as estimated from  the household survey, adjusted to correspond as closely as possible to the concept of employment measured in the establishment survey ( figure 3), also shows a n improvement in the labor market --indeed , by somewhat more  than in the establishment survey ."
" I should note, however, that  month -tomonth changes in this measure are much more volatile than the  employment measur e from the establishment survey , which is why the Federal Reserve puts more weight on the establishment survey  for the purposes of short -term forecasting ."
"  The positive signs from the labor market have shown through to measures of labor utilization :  After hover ing around 9 percent for much of last year , the unemployment rate ( figure 4) has moved down since September  to 8.3 percent in Februar y, and the share of employment represented by people working part  time for economic reasons, an indicator of underutilization, has declined modestly ."
Surveys of households and firms about their attitudes and expectations  offer yet another window on job market  developments .
" Other indicators, such as new claims for unemployment insuran ce and measures of the breadth of hiring across industries, also point to better  labor market conditions."
" Notwithstanding these welcome recent signs,  the job market remains quite weak  relative to historical norms , as I’ve already noted ."
" After nearly two y ears of job gains , private payroll employment remains more than 5  million  jobs below its previous peak ; - 4 -   the jobs shortfall is even larger, of course, when increases in the size of the labor force are taken into account."
  And the unemployment rate in Februa ry was still roughly 3 percentage points above its average over the 20 years preceding the recession.
" The monthly increase in payroll employment , which commands so much public attention , is a net change ."
" In cont rast, the increase in employment s ince the end of 200 9 has been due to a significant decline in layoff s but only a mo derate improvement in  hiring ."
" To achieve a more  rapid recovery in the job market, hiring rates will need to return to more normal levels."
 - 5 -   The Change in Unemployment and Economic Growth:  A Puzzle?
" What will lead to more hiring  and, consequently, further d eclines in unemployment ?"
 The short answer is more -rapid economic growth.
"  Indeed, the improvement in the labor market  over the past year --especially t he decline in the unemployment rate --has been faster than might have been expected, given that the econom y during that time appears to have grow n at a relatively modest pace ."
 That rule of thumb  describes the observed relationship between changes  in the unemployment rate and the growth  rate of real gross domestic product  (GDP ).
" Okun no ted that, because of  ongoing increases in the size of the labor force an d in the level of productivity, real GDP growth close to the rat e of growth of its potential  is normally required just  to hold  the unemployment rate steady."
" To reduce  the unemployment rate, therefore, the economy must grow at a pac e above its potential ."
" More specifically, a ccording to currently accepted versions of O kun’s law, to achieve a 1 percentage point decline in the unemployment rate  in the course of a year , real GDP must grow approximately 2 percent age points  faster than the rate of growth of potential GDP  over that period ."
" So, for illustration, if the potent ial rate  of GDP growth is 2 percent, Okun’s law says that GDP must grow at about a 4 percent rate for one year to achieve a 1 percentage point reduction in the rate of unemployment."
"  In light of this historical regularity, t he combination of relatively modest  GDP growth with the more substantial improvement in the labor market over the past year is something  of a puzzle ."
"  To illustrate the tension, consider t he relationship - 6 -   between the recent changes in the unemployment rate and in real GDP relative to the  predictions of  Okun’s law ( figure 8)."
" As illustrated by the position of the square labeled “2011” relative to the Okun’s law relationship, represented by t he line, the decline in the unemployment rate over the course of 2011 was greater  than would seem consistent with GDP growth over that period."
" Indeed, with last year’s real GDP growth below 2 percent, less than  what most economists would  estimate to be the U.S. economy’s  potential rate of growth, one might have expected little change in the unemployment rate last year  or even a slight increase ."
" What is th is confluence of the significant decline in the unemployment rate and the mode st recent increase in re al GDP telling us about the state of the economy, and how will the Okun’s law puzzle be resolved?"
" For example, gross domestic income, an alternative measure of economic activity constructed  using source data that are  mostly different from the data used in estimating GDP, provides some c heck on the information provided by the better -known GDP measure."
" However, gross domestic income is currently estimated to have increased less quickly than GDP  in 2011  and so does not point to an explanation of the drop in the unemployment rate ."
 Another logical possibility is that the decline in the unemployment rate could be overstating the  improvement in the job market .
" Because a person has to be either - 7 -   working  or looking for work to be counted as part of the labor force, an increase in the number of people too discouraged to continue their search for work  would reduce the unemployment rate , all else being equal --but not for a positive reason."
" For example, a broad measure of labor underutilization that includes peop le only marginally attached to the labor force  has decline d about in line  with the unemployment rate since late 2010  (figure 10).1  On balance, an assessment of  a broad range of indicators suggests that a substantial portion of the decline in the unemployment rate does reflect genuine improvement in labor market conditions."
"  In 2008 and 2009, the decline in payrolls and  the associated  jump in unemployment were extraordinary ."
" In particular,  using the Okun’s law metric,  the runup in the unemployment rate in 2009 appears “too large”  relative even to the substantial decline in real GDP  that occurred ."
 The open triangle labeled “2009” in the upper left of the figure shows an increase in the unemployment rate in that year well above the one implied by the contraction in real GDP and Okun’s law .
"                                                    1 The broader measure of labor underutilization re ferenced here is the U -5 measure of unemployment, constructed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics."
" - 8 -    The diagram suggests that what we may be seeing now is  the flip side of th e fear -driven layoffs that occurred during the worst part of the recession, as firms have become sufficiently confident  to move the ir workforces into closer alignment with the expected demand for their products."
" However, to the extent that the decline in the unemployment rate since last summer has brought unemployment back more into line with the level of aggregate demand , then further significant improvements in unemployment will likely require faster economic growth  than we experienced during the past year ."
" It will be especially important to evaluate incoming information to assess whether the recovery is picking up as improvements in the labor market feed  through to consumer and business confidence ; or, conversely, whether the headwinds that have impeded  the recovery to date continue to restrain the pace at which the labor market and economic activity normalize ."
The Challenge of Long -term Unemployment  Discussions of the labor market at this juncture  necessarily have a “glass half -empty  or halffull” tone.
" Rece nt improvements are encouraging, but, as  I have noted,  in an absolute sense , the job market  is still  far from normal  by many measures , and millions of families continue to suffer the day -today hardships associated with not being able to find suitable employment ."
" Although most spells of unemployment are disruptive or costly, the persistently high rate of longterm unemployment  we have seen over the past - 9 -   three years or so  is especially concerning."
" In this episode, b oth the median and average duration s of unemployment have reached levels far outside the range of experience  since World War II  (figure 11)."
 And the share of unemployment that represents  spells lasting more than six months has been  higher than  40 percent since  December 2009  (figure  12).
" By way of comparison, th e share  of unemployment that was long  term in nature  never exceeded  25 percent  or so  in the severe 1981 -82 recession ."
"   Those who have experienced unemployment know the burdens that it creates, and a growing academic literature docume nts some dimensions of those burdens."
" For example, research has shown that workers who lose previously  stable jobs experience sharp declines in earnings that may last for many years , even after they find new work .2  Surveys indicate that more than one -half of the households experiencing long unemployment spells since the onset of the recent recession withdrew money from savings and retirement accounts to cover expenses, onehalf borrowed money from family and friends,  and one -third struggled to meet housing expenses.3  Unemployment also take s a toll on people’s health  and may have long -term consequences for the families of the unemployed as well ."

 Elevated unemployment strains public finances  because of  both lost tax revenue and the payment of increased unempl oyment benefits and other income support to affected families.
" People unemployed for a long time have historically found jobs less easily than those experiencing shorter spells of unemployment, perhaps because their skills erode, they lose relationships w ithin the workforce, or they acquire  a stigma that deters firms from hiring them."
 Loss of skills and lower rates of employment reduce  the economy’s overall productive capacity over the longer term.
" In the shorter term, b ecause  the process of matching the longterm unemployed to jobs typically takes more time , the current ly high level of long -term unemployme nt might in itself be a reason that further progress in reducing the unemployment rate , and thus in achieving a more complete recovery,  could be slow .6   A pessimistic view is that a large share of the unemployment we are seeing, particularly the longer -term unemployment, is structural in nature, reflecting factors such                                                                                                                                                  Social Behavior , vol."

- 11 -   as inadequate skills  or mismatch es between the types of skills that workers have and the skills that employers demand.
" If this view is correct, then high levels of long -term unemployment could persist for quite a while, even after the economy has more fully recovered."
"  And it appears true that o ver the past two decades or so, structural f actors have been responsible for some  increase in long -term unemployment ."
" For example, because an older worker who loses a job typically takes longer  to find a new job than does a younger worker in the same situation, the aging of the baby boom generation has probably contributed to a gradual rise in long -term unemployment."
" To the extent that higher rates of unemployment, especially long -term unemployment, result from structural factors, the scope for coun tercyclical  policies to reduce unemployment would be impaired , and the benefits of a more complete economic  recovery for many workers who are unemployed or discouraged would be more limited."
" However, a lthough structural shifts are  no doubt  important in the long er term, my reading of the research is that, at most , a modest  portion  of the recent sharp increase in longterm unemployment is due to  persistent structural factors.7  Consider, for example, rates of job finding by th ose unemployed for varying amounts of time  (figure 13)."
" Unsurprisingly, the rate at which the long -term unemployed find work is lower than that of those who have been unemployed for only a short time; on average over the period from 1994 to 2007, a bit more than one -third of those already unemploye d for one to four weeks found employment within the next month."
" In contrast, over that same period, only                                                  7 For some  discussion of this effect, see Organisation for Economic Co -operation and Development (2011), OECD Employment Outlook 2011, www.oecd.org/employment/outlook;  and Aaronson and others , “Wh at Is behind the R ise in LongTerm Unemployment?” (see note 6)."
"  If the recent increase in long -term unemployment were being driven by structural factors rather than, say, the severity of the recession, then the jobfinding rates of the longterm unemployed should have fallen sharply relative to those out of work for only a few weeks ."
" Rather, as figure 13 shows, the job finding rates of the more recently unemployed and the long -term unemployed all fell over the recession in roughly the same proportion, and they remain low.8  This patte rn is consistent with cyclical factors accounting for t he bulk of the recent increase in long -term unemployment ."
" Similarly, the fact that labor demand appears weak in most industries and locations is suggestive of a general shortfall  of aggregate demand r ather a worsening mismatch of skills and jobs."
" Counterexamples like the energy boom in the upper Midwest , where there may be some mismatch in the geographic location of suitably  skilled workers or a n overall  shortage of potential workers with relevant ski lls, might best be interpreted as the  exception s that prove the rule; a mismatch story would suggest that strong labor demand would be appearing in more sectors or geographical areas by now."
 Th at curve --named after  the British economist William Beveridge --compares unemployment (the number of workers looking for employers) to job vacancies (the number of workers that employers are seeking).
" In good times, when the unemployment rate is low, businesses are growing and workers are harder to find, so job vacancies tend to be high."
"Elsby, Bart Hob ijn, and Aysegül Sahin (2010), “ The Labor Market in the Great Recession ,” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity  (Spring), pp."
"- 13 -   Similarly, in bad times, unemployment is high and  few jobs are available (vacancies are low)."
" Thus , the Beveridge curve, the relationship between unemployment and vacancies, is downward sloping."
" On the usual interpretation, a recession is a period in which the economy is moving down along the Beveridge curve; as output and the demand for labor fall, job vacancies decline and unemployment rises."
" In contrast, changes in the structural determinants of unemployment  are thought to be reflected in  shifts of the Beveridge curve to the left or right."
" Then, for a given number of job openings, the number of the unemployed who are q ualified for those jobs is smaller  and the un employment rate is higher than it would have been before the mismatch problem worsened ."
" From figure  14, we can see some  outward shift in the relationship between job vacancies and unemployment, consistent with some  increase in structural unemployment since the onset of the recession."
"  However,  a more in -depth analysis of the  evidence suggests t hat the apparent shift in the relationship between vacancies and unemployment is neither unusual for a recession nor likely to be persistent ."
"  This temporary outward shift  during a deep recession  may be the result of a particularly sharp increase in layoffs, which raise s unemployment quickly, eve n as - 14 -   vacancies adjust more slowly."
" Another possible explanation for a temporary shift in the Beveridge curve is extended and emergency unemployment insurance, which induce s unemployed workers who might otherwise consider leaving the labor force to continu e searching for work ."
" In any case, the data appear consistent with the shift in  the vacancy -unemployment relationship in recent years having been relatively modest and likely to reverse , at least in part,  as the economy recover s further."
" When historical experience is taken into account, t hese patterns do not support the view that st ructural factors are a major cause of the increase in unemployment  during the most recent recession .9 Conclusion   To sum up:  A wide range of indicators suggest s that the job market has been improving,  which is  a welcome development indeed."
" Still, conditi ons remain far from normal, as shown, for example, by the high level of long -term unemployment and the fact that jobs and hours worked remain well below pre -crisis peaks, even without adjusting                                                  9 For a discussion of shifts in the Beveridge curve during previous recessions, see John Lindner and Murat Tasci (2010), “Has the Beveridge Curve Shifted?”  Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland,  Economic Trends , August , www.clevelandfed.o rg/research/trends/2010/0810/02labmar.cfm ; and Robert Valletta and Katherine Kuang (2010), “Is Structural Unemployment on the Rise?”  Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, FRBSF Economic Letter,  2010 -34, November 8 , www.frbsf.org/publications/economics/le tter/2010/el2010 -34.html ."
" For research examining the specific role of mismatch, see Regis Barnichon and Andrew Figura (2010), “What Drives Movements in the Unemployment Rate?"
" Other factors affecting the Beveridge curve include the role of extended unemployment benefits and potential effects of lags betwee n vacancies and hiring ; on the effects of unemployment benefits, see Robert Valletta and Katherine Kuang (2010), “Extended Unemployment and UI Benefits,” Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, FRBSF Economic Letter,  2010 -12, April 19 , www.frbsf.org/publica tions/economics/letter/2010/el2010 -12.html ; on the lag between job vacancies and hiring, see Steven J."
- 15 -   for growth in the labor force.
" Notably, an examination of recent deviations from Okun’s law suggests that the recent decline in the unemployment rate may reflect , at least in part , a reversal of the unusually large  layoffs that occurred during late 2008 and over 2009 ."
" To the extent that this reversal has been completed, further significant improvement s in the unemployment rate will likely require a more -rapid  expansion of production and deman d from consumers a nd businesses, a process that can be supported by continued accommodative  policies ."
"I also discussed long -term unemployment today, arguing that cyclical rather than structural factors are likely the primary source of its substantial increase during the recession."
" We must watch  longterm unemployment especially carefully, however."
" Even if the primary cause of high long -term unemployment is insufficient aggregate demand, if progress in reducing unemployment is too slow , the long -term unemployed will see their skills and labor for ce attachment atrophy further, possibly converting a cyclical problem into a structural one."
" If this hypothesis is wrong and structural factors are in fact explaining much of the increase in long -term unemployment, then the scope for countercyclical policies  to address this problem will be more limited."
" I f structural factors are the predominant explanation for the increase in long -term unemployment, it  will become even more important to take the steps needed to  ensure that workers are able to obtain the skills needed to meet the demands  of our rapidly changing economy."
