"For release on delivery  8:00 a.m. EDT  June 1, 2017         Thoughts on the Normalization of Monetary Policy    Remarks by   Jerome H."
Economic Developments  The Federal Reserve is committed to fulfilling our  statutory mandate of stable prices and maximum employment.
" To begin with the labor market, m any indicators suggest that the economy is  close to  full employment."
" In April , the unemployment rate was 4.4 percent, a level not reached since May 2007 and below most current estimates of the natural rate of unemployment ( figure 1).1  Estimates of the natural rate are inherently uncertain, but other labor market measures are also near their precrisis levels, including a broader measure of labor market underutilization that includes those who would like to work but have not recently looked for a job and those working part time who want  fulltime work.2  The labor force participation rate, which had declined sharply after the crisis, has now been roughly stable for 31/2 years, which represents an improvement                                                   1 For example, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that the natural rate of unemployment is currently 4.7 percent."
" The March 2017 Blue Chip Economic Indicators reported that the consensus forecast for the unemployment rate over 2024 to 2028 was 4.7 percent, with the top 10 projections averaging 5.1 percent and the bottom 10 averaging 4.3 percent."
 The median estimate of the longer -run normal rate of unemployment in the March 2017 Summary of Economic Projections was 4.7 percent.

" Although average hourly earnings are rising only about 2.5 percent per year, slower  than befor e the crisis, much of that downshift may reflect the slowdown in productivity growth we have experienced."
" For example, over the past three years , unit labor costs --that is, nominal wage s adjusted for increases in productivity --have been generally rising a bit faster than prices .4   Turning to inflation, t he FOMC interpret s price stability to mean inflation of  2 percent as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures  (PCE).5  This objective is symmetric, so the Committee would be concer ned if inflation were to  run persistently above or below this target."
" Inflation has run below 2 percent  for most of the period since the financial crisis , reflecting  generally soft economic conditions as well as transitory factors such as the earlier decl ines in energy prices ."
" But over the past two years, inflation has moved gradually closer to our objective."

4 There are several other measures of nominal wage growth in addition to the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ (BLS) average hourly earnings.
" The BLS employment cost index measure of year -overyear wage and salary growth was also 2.5 percent in the first quarter, while the BLS measure of compensation per hour rose to 3.9 percent."
 The unit labor cost measure is based on the BLS measures of compensation per hour and productivity for the business sector.

" C ore inflation, which excludes food and energy prices, has proven historically to be  a better indicator  of where overall inflation is heading , although it , too, can be affected by transitory factors such as import prices ."
 Core inflation was 1.5 percent for the 12 months through April.
" This measure has also risen since 2015, although its gradual increase appears to have paused because of  weak inflation readings for Marc h and April."
 And there are good reasons to expect that inflation will resume its gradual rise.
" Nonetheless, it is important that the Committee assess incoming inflation data carefully and continue to demonstrate a strong commitment to achieving our symmetric 2 percent objective."
" Despite strong job gains, very weak productivity gains  have led to disappointingly slow economic growth of only about 2 percent over the course of this expansion (figure  4)."
" While m onetary policy can contribute to growth by supporting a durable expansion in a context of price stability , it cannot reliably affect the long -run sustainable level of the economy’s growth.6  The success of monetary policy  should be judged by the                                                  6 I have argued elsewhere that we need to find ways to increase our long -term growth and spread that prosperity broadly  if we are to avoid this “low growth trap .”  We need policies that support business investment, labor force participation , and productivity growth."
 Increased spending on public infrastructure may raise private -sector productivity over time.
"  My baseline expectation is that the economy will continue  on a path of growth of about 2 percent, strong job creation and tightening labor markets, and in flation moving up toward our 2 percent target."
" I expect that unemployment will decline a bit further and remain at low levels for some time, which could draw more workers into the workforce, put upward pressure on wages, or  cause businesses to invest more  as labor costs rise , all of which I would view as desirable outcome s."
" In particular, the global picture has brightened as growth and inflation have broadly moved up for the first time in several years."
" Here at home, risks seem both moderate and balanced, i ncluding the downside risk of lower inflation and the upside risk of labor market overheating."
     Monetary Policy Normalization  The healthy state of our economy and favorable outlook suggest that the FOMC should continue the process of normalizing moneta ry policy.
" While the recent performance of the labor market might warrant a faster pace of tightening, inflation has been below target for five years and has moved up only slowly toward 2 percent, which argues for continued patience , especially if that progress slows or stalls."
" In contrast, the FOMC’s easing of monetary policy increased  over time as the longer -term economic effects of the crisis gradually became clear."
"8 The FOMC’s purchases of longer -term securities (U.S. Treasury securities , agency debt obligations,  and agencyguaranteed mortgage -backed securities ) reduced the outstanding stock of these securities available in the market and therefore tended to put upward pressure on bond prices and downwa rd pressure on their yields --specifically, on the term  premium component of longer -term interest rates."
" This unconventional monetary policy was an appropriate means of providing a boost to spending by households and firms during a period of economic slack , when our ability to provide accommodation by conventional means was limited by the fact that the federal funds rate had reached almost zero."
  - 6 - of monetary policy will return both tools to a more neutral setting over time.
"  • The Committee will continue to use the federal funds rate as its principal tool for adjusting the stance of monetary policy.13     • Once the process of balance sheet normalization has begun, it should continue as planned as long as there is no material deterioration in the economic outlook.14                                                    10 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2015), “Federal Reserve Issues FOMC Statement,” press release, December 16, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20151216a.htm ."
"  - 8 - • In the long run, the balance sheet should be no larger than it needs to be to allow the Committee to conduct monetary policy under its chosen framework.15 Taken together, the Committee’s communications present the broad outline of our likely approach to normalizing the balance sheet."

"18 Of course, estimates of the effects of monetary policy on term premiums often differ."
" In the long run, the ultimate size of the balance s heet will depend mainly on the demand for Federal Reserve liabilities --currency, reserves, and other liabilities --and on the Committee’s long -run framework for setting interest rates.21   The next slide compares the Fed’s balance sheet of May 2007 with that  of May 2017 (figure 8)."
" This growth reflects strong domestic and international demand for U.S. currency, which is expected to continue."
 The eventual level of demand for reserves  is less certain but is highly likely to exceed pre -crisis levels when reserve balances averaged only about $15 billion.
" Reserves are the ultimate “safe asset,” and demand for safe assets has increased subst antially over time because of long -run trends, including regulatory requirements ."
"Logan (2017), “Implementing Monetary Policy:  Perspective from the Open Market Trading Desk,” speech delivered at the Money Marketeers of New York University, New York, May 18, https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2017/log170518."
"  To gain a sense of the possible long -run size of the balance sheet, the next slide shows simulations under three different assumptions for the ultimate level  of reserve balances:  $100 billion, $600 billion, and $1 trillion (figure 10).22  These simulations show that, due to the growth of currency and other l iabilities , the balance sheet will remain considerably above its pre -crisis levels even if reserves were to fall back to $100 billion (the black line)."
" At its current growth rate, currency in circulation would reach $2 trillion by 2022 and $2.8 trillion in 2027."
" Even in the low case in which reserves decline to $100 billion, our balance sheet would be about $2.4 trillion in 2022 and would grow from there in line with currency demand."
" To affect financial conditions, the Federal Reserve has therefore used administered rates, including the interest rate paid on excess reserves (IOER) and, more recent ly, the offering rate of the overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) facility."
" In November 2016, when the Co mmittee discussed using a floor system as part of its longer -run framework, I was among those who saw such an approach as “l ikely to be relatively simple and efficient to administer, relatively straightforward to communicate, and effective in enabling interest rate control across a wide range of circumstances .”24  Some  have advocated a return to a framework similar to the pre -2007 system, in which the volume of reserves would likely be far below its present level and the federal funds rate would be  managed  by frequent open market operations.25  This “corridor” fram ework remains a feasible option, although, in my view , it may be less robust over time than a floor system."
"  Concluding Remarks  After a tumultuous decade, the economy is now close to full  employment and price stability."
" Accommodative policy did not generate high inflation or excessive credit growth; rather,                                                  24 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2016), “Minutes of the Federal Open Mark et Committee, November 1 -2, 2016,”  press release,  November 23, paragraph 6, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20161123a.htm ."
 - 13 - it helped restore  full employment and return inflation closer to our 2 per cent goal .
 The current discussions of the normalization of monetary policy are a result of  that success.
