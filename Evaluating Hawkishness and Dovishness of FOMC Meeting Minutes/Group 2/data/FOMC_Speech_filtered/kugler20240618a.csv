"For release on delivery  1:00 p.m. EDT  June 18, 2024         Some Reasons for Optimism about Inflation     Remarks by   Adriana D."
" It is great to come to Peterson to discuss the economic outlook and monetary policy, which is my topic this afternoon.1 As I stand here today, inflation remains too high, but I am encouraged by the overall progress and trajectory."
 Recent data on the economy and inflation also give me cautious optimism that we are on track and making continued headway toward the Federal Open Market Committee’s  (FOMC)  inflation goal of 2 percent.
" That progress may have paused in the first three months of the year, but information since then on economic activity, the labor market, and inflation point s to renewed progress."
"    Over the last year through April, personal consumption expenditure s (PCE) inflation was 2.7 percent, down from 7.1 percent at its peak in 2022."
" Core PCE inflation —which excludes the volatile food and energy categories —was 2.8 percent through April, down from its peak of 5.6 percent."
" Based on consumer and producer price inflation for May released last week, I estimate that 12 -month PCE inflation in May was a bit lower than in April."
" I was encouraged by some of the details of the recent reports, particularly the continued improvement in market -based services inflation, which is based on observation of actual market prices rather than imputed values."
 That’s important because market -based prices are likely to be a better indication of the overall trend for core services inflation than nonmarket prices.
" Housing services inflation, meanwhile, continues to be persistent."
  - 2 - housing services inflation will rely on the ongoing pass -through of the previous  market rents deceleration to the rents of existing tenants with expiring leases.
" So inflation is still too high, and further progress is likely to be gradual."
" However, there are several reasons why I remain optimistic that improving supply and cooling demand will support continued disinflation."
The first reason I am optimistic about further progress on inflation has to do with declining price increases and even declining prices as consumers become more price sensitive.
" And the frequency with which firms adjust prices, which accelerated to less than every five  months in early 2022, moved closer to every seven months as of the end of 2023.2  Price adjustment frequency picked up some early this year, along with the temporary firming of inflation, but the general trend has been consistent with ongoing disinflation."
An additional basis  for price -setting optimism is the fact that longer -run inflation expectations have remained well anchored.
" Research by the Richmond Fed has found that price -setting decisions by firms are related to their own expectations about the path of overall inflat ion, so anchored inflation expectations among firms are likely to result in price setting consistent with those lower price expectations.3  2 These facts are from Hugh Montag and Daniel Villar (2023), “PriceSetting during the Covid Era,” FEDS Notes (Washington:  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, August 29) , https://doi.org/10.17016/23807172.3298."
" 3 For research on firms’ price -setting and inflation expectations , see Felipe F."
"Schwartzman and Sonya Ravindranath Waddell (2024), “Inflation Expectations and Price Setting among Fifth District Firms,” Economic Brief 2403 (Richmond, Va.:  Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, January) , https://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/economic_brief/2024/eb_24 -  - 3 - In addition, there may still be room for markups of prices over labor costs to continue falling."
" While markups are famously difficult to measure, rough, simple estimates of markups of prices over labor costs have fallen back from high levels but still remain above their pre -pandemic trend, especially in the goods sector.4  A return of markups to this trend could help ongoing progress toward 2 percent inflation."
" These various indicators —markups, price adjustment frequency, inflation expectations, and anecdotes from a range of   03#:~:text=Evidence%20from%20a%20Federal%20Reserve,most%20firms%20set%20their%20prices ."
" With regard to  overall measures of inflation expectations, anchored longer -run inflation expectations are apparent in the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers, where 5to-10year-ahead expectations remain close to values seen a decade ago; in the Survey of Professional Forecasters, where 10year inflation expectations are close to prepandemic norms ; and in other sources."
" 4 For example, the ratio of the producer price index (PPI) for final demand goods to the employment cost index for private goods industries rose roughly 20 percent from the end of 2020 to the middle of 2022."
"  - 4 - sources —suggest that, on balance, price -setting behavior is likely to continue to move closer to consistency with the FOMC’s  inflation target."
 A second reason  for my optimism about continued disinflation is slower growth in the costs faced by businesses.
" Nominal wage growth has continued to trend down, consistent with a labor mar ket where supply and demand are coming into better balance."
" Of course, as a general matter, I want to see Americans experiencing strong wage growth, but for that wage growth to be sustainable , it must be consistent with our inflation target."
" Notably, as inflation has come down, real wages have been rising and now exceed pre -pandemic levels, which means that the purchasing power of workers has also been increasing."
" But at the same time, we have seen slowing growth in nominal labor costs ."
" The latest readings compare with an a verage of around 3 percent a year before the pandemic, when inflation was running below our 2 percent goal."
" If this moderation in wage growth continues, it will soon be at levels consistent with price stability."
 And I note that the marketbased services inflation measure I mentioned earlier tends to move closely with wage growth.
" But most other  - 5 - indicators point to a slow but steady easing of the labor market, supported by cooling demand for hiring as well as strong supply."
"In terms of demand, both the job openings  rate and the hiring rate have come down from their highs of late 2021 and early 2022."
 Surveys of business hiring intentions likewise suggest cooler demand for workers.
" On the supply side, we have seen notable growth in labor supply over the past year."
" And the strong inflows of immigrants I have discussed in previous  speeches have continued this year, which points to continued labor supply growth as recent immigrants gradually make their way into the labor market."
"  With cooling demand and solid supply, measures of labor market tightness have continued to ease."
" The unemployment rate has been gradually rising and reached 4 percent in May, still very low in historical terms and the 30th  straight month at 4 percent or lower."
" We policymakers like to make our judgments based on a preponderance of the data, and a preponderance of the labor market data indicates  that labor market supply and demand are coming into better balance."
"  - 6 - A third reason for my optimism about achieving 2 percent inflation is that I am also cautiously optimistic about productivity growth, which is a source of supply expansion that is likely to put downward pressure on inflation without slower economic growth."
" One factor is the remarkable rise in the rate of new business creation, which started early in the pandemic and has continued, more or less, even through last month.5  Economic research finds that while many new and young firms struggle to survive, a small subset of new firms are highly productive and grow rapidly, eventually making significant contributions to aggregate productivity.6  And the pandemic -era business creation surge has been particularly strong in high -tech sectors, such as computer systems design and research and development services.7  Some recent history favors a payoff to productivity growth from this surge in entrepreneurship."
" Before  the jump  in productivity growth in the late 1990s through the early 2000s, there was a similar wave of strong business entries in hightech industries.8  I suspect that most of the productivity benefits of the recent entry surge are still ahead of us."

 - 7 - Another basis for productivity optimism is the prospect for widespread implementation of artificial intelligence ( AI) in its various forms.
" Of course, many technologies can take a long t ime to show through to aggregate productivity."
" And survey data from the  Census Bureau suggest that firms in many sectors are already employing AI.9  Only time will tell, of course, but the prospect of higher productivity growth raises the possibility that inflation can fall without a significant slowdown in economic activity and employment."
My fourth and final reason for optimism on inflation is that I believe the current stance of monetary policy is sufficiently restrictive to help cool the economy and bring inflation back toward 2 percent without a sharp contraction in economic activity or a significant deterioration of the labor market.
" Interest rates remain elevated relative to a year ago, and certainly relative to two or three years ago, and are restricting economic  9 Data  are from the Census Bureau’s  Business Trends and Outlook Survey."
" Of course, some aspects of financial conditions, such as house prices and, especially , stock prices, remain robust; and credit is still generally available, though high interest rates make borrowing expensive."
 But the overall restrictiveness of financial conditions is apparent in interest rate –sensitive sectors.
 Business investment in equipment contracted a bit in 2023 and showed only tepid growth in the first quarter of this year.
" And while consumption growth has been resilient over the past couple  of years, fueled in par t by excess savings accumulated during the pandemic and solid real wages that now exceed prepandemic levels, it slowed noticeably in the first quarter, especially for spending on goods."
" Indeed, high interest rates have left a mark on consumer assessments of buying conditions for motor vehicles and other large durable goods, which often have to be financed.10    The effects of restrictive financial conditions are also evident in labor markets."
" As I discussed earlier, the labor market has cooled gradually, and, looking ahead, I expect some cooling of economic activity to continue."
" But I am watching closely for any signs  10 In the Michigan Surveys  of Consumers, the net shares of respondents report ing that now is a bad time to buy, versus a good time to buy, motor vehicles or large household durables, specifically because of high interest rates, remain well above prepandemic levels, though there has been some gradual improvement since mid -2022."
" On the inflation side, the resurgence of import prices at the beginning of the year is concerning, even if import prices came down some last month, and could anticipate greater pressure on goods prices in the coming months."
" Goods prices have been a key source of disinflation over the past year or so, as supply chains have healed."
" Output growth appears to have slowed in the first half of this year, and w hile consumer spending still grew in the first quarter, the May retail sales report we received this morning may be another signal  that the longexpected deceleration in consumer spending may finally be upon us."
" After a considerable decline in job vacancies, firms facing dec reasing  demand might increasingly resort to laying off workers."
" While growth in some countries —notably in Europe —appears to be picking up from a soft patch last year, that  pickup remains tentative."
 - 10 - Let me now turn to the implications of my economic outlook for monetary policy.
" While I remain cautiously optimistic that inflation is coming down, it is still too high, and it is moving down only slowly."
 We need to see more progress toward 2 percent inflation before I will have confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward that objective.
"  Let me conclude by acknowledging that the surge in inflation over the past few years means that prices are now significantly higher than they were just a few years ago, even as the rate of price increases has slowed dramatically since mid -2022."
