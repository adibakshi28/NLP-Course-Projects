  I don’t want to take up too much of the time for our discussion but let me frame a few of the issu es around inflation and the economic outlook.1   Last month we received  a barrage of data that has challeng ed my view in January that the Federal Open Market  Committee (FOMC) was making significant progress in moderat ing economic activity and reduc ing inflation.
" Part of the FOMC’s plan to lower inflation is r educing this  excess tightness , which has been driving elevated wage growth  and contributing to high inflation."
" But then on February 3, the job report for January show ed a stunning 517,000 increase in employment  and the unemployment r ate moved down to a level not seen in over 50 years .2  These data indicated  that, instead of loosening, the labor market was tightening.3  A little over a week later, o n Valentine’s Day , instead of a box of chocolates, we got the  1 These remarks represent my own views, which do not necessarily represent those of the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee."
" 2 Some have argued that the large change in payroll employment should be discounted because of  unusually warm  weather; however, estimates of weather -adjusted employment a re also quite large."
" See Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (2023), “Weather -Adjusted Employment Change,” webpage, https://www.frbsf.org/economic -research/indicators -data/weather -adjusted -employment -change."
  - 2 -  consumer price i ndex ( CPI) inflation report for January and revisions to 2022.
" By this measure,  not only had inflation stopped declining in January, it also slowed a lot less in the second half o f last year than previously reported.4  Later that week , data on producer prices  and last week ’s report on personal consumption expenditures  (PCE) prices reinforced these two points ."
" Continuing progress on inflation depends on lowering demand and moderating economic activity, and the  retail sales and spending data suggest that progress on reducing aggregate demand may have stalled ."
"Whether or not subsequent data confirm the setback  in progress last month, the FOMC  will do what i s needed to reduce inflation to the Committee’s 2 percent objective over time ."
 Inflation has been elevated for  nearly two years due to an excess of aggregate demand relative to supply.
" Even though the fiscal stimulus and goods supply constraints that contributed to that imbalance have mostly unwound and the FOMC has rapidly raised the target range for the federal funds rate, the lab or market remains very tight and aggregate demand has proved resilient to considerable increases in interest rates."
 One implication of the strong labor market is that the FOMC’s maximum employment goal has been achieved and monetary policy can be utterly focused on fighting inflation.
 Any fear that we might face  twosided risk in achieving our dual mandate was blown away by the January employment numbers.
"   - 3 -  an excessively tight labor market complicates the path toward achieving price stability , because wages are growing faster than they have in decades, at a pace that may contribut e to keeping inflation elevated."
" We see this excess pressure in the fast growth of services prices, where labor costs are a higher share of overall input costs and shortages of workers are reportedly most acute."
" Although inflation  has been coming down since the middle of last year, the recent data indicate that we h aven’t made as much progress as we thought ."
" That assessment goes for both overall inflation, and “core” inflation, which strips out volatile energy and food prices and is a good guide to future price increases ."
 And this holds for both CPI and PCE measures of inflation .
 Core CPI inflation over  the last three months of 2022 was revised up from 3.1 percent ( at an annual rate) to now be 4.3 percent .
" Similarly , the 2022 fourth quarter  PCE inflation data was revised from 2.9 percent to 3.6 percent."
" These data underscore the view , as laid out in the FOMC’s  December Summary of Economic Projections, that the fight to bring inflation down to our 2 percent  target will be slower and longer than many had expected just a month or two ago."
"I don’t want to brush aside the fact that we have made progress in reducing inflation , and there are indications that  further improvement  is coming."
" T he three -month inflation  rate is running below the  12month rate, which highlights the progress."
" And there are reasons to be optimistic about continued improvement, including a sha rp deceleration in rent increases  since the middle of last year , which will start to get captured in inflation statistics only in the coming months."
" - 4 -  But recent data suggest that consumer spending isn’t slowing that much, that the labor market continues  to run unsustainably hot, and that inflation is not coming down as fast as I had thought ."
" It could be that progress has stalled, or i t is possible that the numbers released last month were a blip , perhaps associated with unusually favorable weather, and that forthcoming data will show that economic activity and inflation resumed their decline."
"  Fortunately, we will get the next employment report and CPI release ahead of the March 21–22 FOMC meeting , information that will affect my assessment of the appropriate next step for monetary policy."
" If job creation drops back down to a level  consistent with the downward trajectory seen late last year and CPI inflation pulls back significant ly from the Janua ry numbers and resumes  its downward path, then I would endorse  raising the target range for the federal funds rate a couple more times , to a  projected terminal rate between 5.1 and 5.4 percent .5  On the other hand, if those data reports continue to come in too hot, the policy target range will have to be raised this year even more to ensure that we do not lose the momentum that was in place before the data for January were release d."
" I would be ver y pleased if the data we receive on inflation and the labor market this month  show signs of moderation, which would suggest that the February data releases were just a bump in the road and that progress is continuing."
" After seeing promising signs of progress, we cannot risk a revival of inflation."
