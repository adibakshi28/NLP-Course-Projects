"  For release on delivery  10:00 a.m.  EDT  October 7 , 2021         Building Climate Scenario Analysis on the Foundations  of Economic Research     Remarks by   Lael Brainard   Member   Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at the  2021 Federal Reserve Stress Testing Research Conference Federal Reserve Bank of Boston   Boston, Massachusetts  (via webcast)         October 7 , 2021    I want to thank all of you for joining our research conference and the organizing committee for inviting me to share some thoughts  on climate scenario analysis .1   Economic analysis suggests  that climate change could have profound consequences for the level, trend growth, and variability of ec onomic activity over time and across regions and sectors."
" Economic activity has tended to rebound quickly after sporadic extreme weather events in recent experience, often supported by significant reconst ruction."
" These cumulative and chronic changes could have economic effects that differ substantively from the historic  experience, for example, i f they contribute to  shifts in the location of economic activity or the sectoral composition within a region ."
The physica l manifestations of climate change could increase the volatility of economic activity and slow economic growth.15  The cumulative effects associated with climate change could lead to irreversible “tipping points” that introduce new climate shocks and chang e the relationships between climate -related shocks and economic variables.

" While s tandard  models for projecting the net revenues of financial institutions are typically driven by national -level proxies of aggregate demand , such as growth and unemployment levels , additional sectoral and regional granularity will be necessary for climate scenario analysis."
