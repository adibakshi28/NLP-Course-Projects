"For release on delivery  1:00 p.m. EST February  1, 2016         Recent Monetary Policy     Remarks by   Stanley Fischer   Vice Chair man  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at the  C."
" To get things started, I thought I could provide some background on recent monetary policy decisions.1   As you all know, at our December mee ting my colleagues and I on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage point , to 1/4 to 1/2 percent.2  This increase came after seven years during which we kept the federal funds rate at what we call the ELB --the effective lower bound."
" This ultra -low rate was in keeping with our congressional mandate to pursue a monetary policy that fosters maximum emplo yment and price stability, which we define as 2 percent inflation."
 Our decision in December was based on the substantial improvement in the labor market and the Committee’s confidence that inflation would return to our 2  percent goal over the medium term.
"  Employment growth last year averaged a solid 220,000 per month, and the unem ployment rate declined from 5.6 percent to 5.0 percent over the course of 2015."
" Inflation ran well below our target last year, held down by the transitory effects of declines in crude oil prices and also in the prices of non -oil imports."
" Once these oil and import prices stop falling and level out, their effects on inflation will dissipate , which  is why we expect that inflation will rise to 2  percent over the medium term,  supported by a further strengthening in labor market conditions."
 - 2 - I would note that our monetary policy remains  accommodative after th e small increase in the federal funds rate adopted in De cember .
"  Given the large size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet, the FOMC is employing new tools to implement monetary policy."
" In particular, to raise the federal funds rate we increased the interest rate we pay on reserve  balances that depository institutions hold at the Federal Reserve."
" We also employed an overnight reverse repurchase facility, through which we interact with a broad range of firms to help provide a soft floor for the federal funds rate consistent with our target range.3  These new tools have worked well, and the federal funds rate and other short -term interest rates have increased slightly, as expected."
 Economic data over the intermeeting period suggested that improvement in labor market conditions continued even as economic growth slowed late last year.
 But further declines in oil prices and increases in the foreign exchange value of the dollar suggested that inflation would likely remain low for somewhat longer than had been previously expected before moving back to 2 percent.
" If these developments lead to a persistent tightening of financial conditions, they could signal a slowi ng in the global economy that could affect growth and inflation in the United States."
" As the FOMC said in its statement last week, we a re closely monitoring global economic and financial developments and assessing their implications for the labor market and inflation, and for the balance of risks to the outlook.4 Now, I expect that in a few minutes one of you will ask not about w hat we di d at our last meeting, but rather what we are going to do at the next one."
" The world is an uncertain place, and all monetary policymakers can really be sure of  is that what will happen is often different from what we currently expect."
" That is, we will adjust policy appropriately in light of economic and financial events t o best foster conditions consistent with the attainment of our employment and inflation objectives."
" - 4 - First, should we be concerned about the possibility of the unemployment rate falling somewhat below its longer -run normal level, as the most recent FOMC projections suggest?"
" First, other measures of labor market conditions --such as the fraction of workers wi th part -time employment who would prefer to work full time and the number of people out of the labor force who would like to work-- indicate that more slack may remain in labor market than the unemployment rate alone would suggest."
" Second, with inflation c urrently well below 2  percent, a modest overshoot actually could be helpful in moving inflation back to 2  percent more rapidly."
" Nonetheless , a persistent large overshoot of our employment mandate would risk an undesirable rise in inflation that might requ ire a relatively abrupt policy tightening, which could  inadvertently push the economy into recession."
 Monetary policy should aim to avoid such risks and keep the expansion on a sustainable track.
"  In this context, I would point out that at our January meeting, we reaffirmed our Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy with an adjustment to clarify that our inflation goal is symmetric.5  That is, the Committee would be concerned if inflation were running persistently above or be low our objective."
" In my view, even if inflation was expected to return to 2 percent over time, persistent deviations from our goal in either direction could cause economic harm and could ultimately unmoor longer -term inflation expectations."
" Of course, w hether the Committee would take action to address a persistent deviation from its inflation objective would depend on the                                                    5 The FOMC’s Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, amended effective January  26, 2016, is available on the Board’s website at www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_LongerRunGoals_20160126.pdf ."
" - 5 - circumstances --and, in particular, on the outlook for employment and inflation and an assessment of the likely lags in the effects of monetary policy."
  My second topic is how best to integrate balance sheet policy with interest rate policy.
"  The Committee has indicated that the Federal Reserve will, in the longer run, hold no more securities than necessary to implement monetary policy e fficiently and effectively ."
