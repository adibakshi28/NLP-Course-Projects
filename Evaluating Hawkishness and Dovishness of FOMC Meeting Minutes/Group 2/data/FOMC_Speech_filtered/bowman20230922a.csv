"For release on delivery  10:30 a.m. EDT ( 8:30 a.m. M DT)  September 22, 2023         Brief Remarks on the Economy and Monetary Policy     by  Michelle W."
" Before we turn to our conversation, I’d like to offer a few thoughts on the economy and monetary policy, since t he members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) met earlier this week."
" As you know, at that meeting, my colleagues and I voted to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5¼ to 5½ percent, after raising rates sharply over the past ye ar and a half to reduce inflation."
" During that time, we have seen considerable progress on lowering inflation, warranting a more gradual pace of increases this year and supporting the decision this week to hold rates steady."
" However, inflation is still too high, and I expect it will likely be appropriate for the Committee to raise rates further and hold them at a restrictive level for some time to return inflation to our 2 percent goal in a timely way."
"    Most recently, the latest inflation reading based on the consumer price index showed that overall inflation rose, responding in part to higher oil prices."
 I see a continued risk that energy prices could rise further and reverse some of the progress we have seen on inflation in recent months.
"  - 2 -  At the sam e time, the economy has remained strong as the FOMC has tightened monetary policy."
 The most rece nt employment report showed a labor market with solid job gains.
 Banks have tighten ed lending standards due to  higher interest rates and  funding costs and in anticipation of future regulatory requirements.
" Despite this t ightening of bank lending standards, we have not s een signs of a  sharp contraction in credit  that would significantly slow economic activity."
" Though bank loan balance growth has slowed, the ongoing strong balance sheets of households and businesses combin ed with the growing importance of nonbanks as sources of credit suggest that the effects of monetary policy on bank lending may have smaller effects on the economy than in the past."
   Given the mixed data releases—strong spending data but a decline in inflation and downward revisions to jobs created in previous months —I supported the FOMC’s decision to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate.
 But I continue to expect that further rate hikes will  likely  be needed to return inflation  to 2 perc ent in a timely way.
 The Summary of Economic Projections released in connection with the September FOMC meeting showed that  the median participant expects inflation to stay above 2 percent at least until the end of 2025.
" This , along with my own expectati on that progress on inflation is likely to be slow given the current level of monetary policy restraint,  - 3 - suggests that further policy tightening will be needed to bring inflation down in a sustainable and timely manner."
 It is important to reiterate that monetary policy is not on a pre -set course.
 We should remain willing to raise the federal funds rate at a future meeting if the incoming data indicates that progress on inflation has stalled or is too slow to bring inflation to 2 percent in a timely way.
 Returning inflation to our 2 percent goal is necessary to achieve a sustainably strong labor market and an economy that works for everyon e.
