"For release on delivery  5:45 p.m. EDT March 31, 2023         The U.S. Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy    Remarks by   Lisa D."
 Today I would like to outline my view s on the trajectory of U.S. economic developments and what th ey imply  for the appropriate path of monetary policy.1 This is a n especially  challenging time to be an  economic analyst or policymaker.
" Recent data show greater momentum in inflation and econo mic activity, but recent banking developments  may suggest greater headwinds for financial conditions and the economy going forward."
" Inflation  surged during the recovery amid pandemic -induced disruptions to supply, while demand for goods was  boosted by a shift away from inperson services , and overall demand was supported by monetary and fiscal policy ."
inflation hit a peak of 7 percent as measured by the 12month change in the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index.
" In response, the Federal Reserve has been using its monetary  policy tools to restore price stability by bringing demand into line with stillconstrained supply."
" Residential investment subtracted nearly 1 percentage point from gross domestic product  growth last year, as housing demand was curtailed by higher mortgage rates."
" As energy prices have moderated and supply disruptions have eased, inflation has started to abate."
"  - 3 - Indeed , the inflation picture is less favorable than it appeared earlier this year."
" Part of the encouraging disinflation initially observed in the fourth quarter of last year was revised away, while inflation over the first two months of this year came in high ."
The inflation data show some persistence.
" Housing services inflation continues at a rapid monthly clip, contributing much  more to inflation than it did before  the pandemic."
 Inflation in non -housing core services remains sticky at elevated levels.
" Even core goods prices rose in January and February, after three months of declines, highlighting the uneven nature of the disinflationary process."
" Even so, several factors are likely to contribute to disinflation."
" Long -term inflation expectations remain well anchored, and shorter -term expectations have retraced much of last year’s rise.2  Rent  increases on new leases have slowed sharply over the past six months, which should begin to pull down measured housing -services inflation over the course of this year."
" Core goods inflation should continue converging toward its pre -pandemic trend of slightly negative numbers, as supply chains continue to heal  and de mand for goods continues to slow ."
 Nonhousing core services inflation is a broad category that accounts for more than half of the core PCE index.
"  Inflation in that category looks quite persistent amid strong post -pandemic demand for travel, dining out, and medical care."
  Disinflation in these services will likely require some combination of slowing demand and further recovery in supply.
 One potential avenue of disinflation is that a decline  in prices for some goods may help lower related services prices.
"  Another potential source of disinflation is that wage growth has moderated somewhat , even as the labor market remains very strong by most measures."
" Payroll employment growth was extraordinarily robust in January and F ebruary, unemployment remains near record lows, and job openings remain very elevated."
 The Federal Reserve Board staff’s measure of private employment using data from the payroll processing firm ADP suggests that job gains slowed in January and February.
"  That could be significant, as much of the surge in wage growth a year ago may have been driven by outsized wage gains of those changing jobs and by employers raising wages to retain existing workers."
" In addition, new estimates show higher population growth over the past year amid  a rebound in immigration."
" Over time, there is reason to believe that rising productivity also may aid supply."
 I see three potential sources of rising productivity growth.
" First, increased innovation associated with the spurt of new businesses since the onset of the pandemic may raise  productivity."
" Second, current labor shortages are spurring increased investment in automation that should boost labor productivity over time."
"  Finally, a recent paper by David Autor, Arin Dube, and Annie McGrew suggests another way that the strong labor market could boost productivity.3  They find that faster wage gains for lower -paid workers have come from jobswitching to higher -wage firms, which may also be more -productive firms."
" Currently, however, supply in the economy continues to be insufficient to meet stillrobust demand."
 Consumer spending is being supported by robust growth in households’ real disposable income amid strong employment growth.
" Altogeth er, the incoming data  would suggest a somewhat higher inflation rate for this year and stronger economic growth."
" I am well aware of the extensive literature linking monetary policy, credit conditions, economic activity, and inflation."
" Thus, I am attentive to whether recent banking developments will restrain credit to small businesses, which could slow innovation and growth in potential output over time."

" - 7 - Data dependence and monetary policy  Turning to monetary policy, I have said frequently that my approach to policymaking in uncertain times is to be data  dependent."
" Taking all these lessons into account, I approach all our monetary policy discussions with the same mindset : • Be prepared to adjust the outlook based on incoming data  while being humble about our ability to draw firm conclusions and thus not overreact ing to a few data points."
"   - 8 - Since my first FOMC meeting last June, my data -dependent, risk -management approach has led me to support the Fed’s response of frontloading monetary policy tightening to bring inflation under control."
" For instance, real interest rates are positive across the yield curve.5 Going forward, I am weighing the implications of stronger momentum in the economy against potential headwinds from recent developments."
"  On the other hand, i f data show continued strength in the economy and slower disinflation, we may have more work to do."
 The FOMC has been  raising rates in smaller increments as we seek a sufficiently restrictive monetary policy stance to return inflation to 2 percent over tim e.
" In its March policy statement, the FOMC dialed back its forward guidance on the path of the policy rate.6  We shifted from anticipating  “ongoing increases ” to saying that  5 These real interest rates are based on prices f rom Treasury Inflation -Protected Securities (TIPS) and infla tion swa p markets, a s well a s  survey expectations."
 - 9 - “some additional policy firming may be appropriate.”  I think this communication is appropriate as we seek to calibrate monetary policy to be sufficiently restrictive amid uncertainty about the economic outlook.
 Yet w hat should not be unce rtain is our commitment to our dual -mandate goals of maximum employment and price stability.
" We will do what it takes to bring inflation back to our 2 percent target over time, which will lay the foundation for sustainable strength in the labor market and the U .S."
