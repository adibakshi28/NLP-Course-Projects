"For release on delivery  12:30 p.m. EDT June 3 , 2016         The Economic Outlook and Implications for  Monetary Policy    Remarks by   Lael Brainard   Member   Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at  Council of Foreign Relations   Washington, D .C."
"  Recent Developments   As we consider the appropriate posture of policy  going forward , the most immedia te question  is whether the data provide confidence that domestic economic activity  has strengthened notably  following two disappointing  quarters ."
 This is critical for making progress on the Committee’s dual mandate objectives of full employment and 2 percent inflatio n.
" Nonfarm payroll employment increased at an average monthly pace of 116,000 over the last three months --well below the 220,000 per month average pace over the preceding twelve months."
"  The unemployment rate moved lower, reaching 4.7 percent, a new low in the current recovery, but i nvoluntary part -time employment increased and the labor force participation rate declined."
"  Even so , there are reasons to expect tha t the labor supply still has room to respond if labor demand increases."
" Importantly , the employment to population ratio for prime -age workers still remains 1 -3/4 percenta ge point s below pre -crisis levels ."
 The recent data on wage inflation suggest a similar conclusion .
" Although there have been some signs of increasing wage growth recently, the stepup has been modest , and growth in the broad measures of wages remai ns quite low."
"   - 2 - year across  the three  most  commonly cited  wage  measures was about 21/2 percent , compared with an average change from the end of 2 009 to the end of 2014 of  2 percent.2   The recent news on inflation --the second leg of our dual mandate --has also been mixed."
 The price of oil has reb ounded significantly from the lows reached earlier in the year on expectations  that supply and demand are likely to come into better alignment .
" Over the same period , the dollar has  receded a bit, on net,  from its peak in January , though it is still about  15 percent above the level in mid -2014  in inflation -adjusted trade -weighted terms ."
" Still, it sho uld be noted that these developments coincided with the easing in financial conditions since mid -February and  are likely due, at least in part, to expectations of more gradual  U.S. monetary policy  tightening ."
" If those expectations were to shift materially , the conditions supporting higher inflation co uld diminish ."
"  While there are thus signs that inflation will move higher over the medium term, measures of core inflation have yet to convincingly exceed the low levels that have prevailed over much of the recovery."
" The 12 -month change in core personal consumption expenditure ( PCE) prices, a reasonable proxy for the underlying trend in inflation, was only 1.6 percent in April ."
 This is still noticeably below our target  and is roughly equal to the average change in core and total PCE inflation from the en d of 2009 to the end of 2014.
     We cannot rule out that stubbornly  low inflation may be having an effect on inflation expectations.
" Market -based measures of inflation compensation --which reflect                                                  2 The three commonly cited  measures of wages are the private -industry employment cost i ndex, compensation per hour in the business sector, and average hourly earnings."
"   - 3 - inflation risk and liquidity premiums, as well as inflation expectations --remain extremely low."
" For example, inflation compensation at the five -year, five -yearahead horizon  is currently around 1.5 percent, 11/4 percentage points below levels prevailing prior to mid2014."
 Some survey -based measures of inflation expectations are also somewhat below historical norms.
" Median 5 - to 10 -year inflation expectations in the University of  Michigan Survey s of Consumers , for example, over the past year have been on average about 1/4 percentage point below the aver age over t he 10 years from 2005 to 2014."
" Thus, although some signs point to a firming of inflation going forward, I view the persistently low level of inflation during the recovery together with some signs of a deterioration in inflation expectations as suggest ing that the risks to the return  of inflation to our 2 percent target over the medium term are weighted to the downside."
 Progress toward our goals of full employment and 2 percent inflation will depend  importantly  on solid  growth in aggregate d emand .
" Following disappointing  gross domestic product ( GDP ) growth in the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year that averaged only 1 .1 percent , I have been very attentive to incoming data, especially on consumption, which  point to a pi ckup in growth this quarter.3  In particular, consumer expenditures  rose a strong  0.6 percent  in April, and auto sales edged higher in  May."
" These are encouraging signs, b ut the data relevant for second -quarter growth are still relatively sparse."
" In gener al, demand growth in recent quarters has benefited from a rela tively strong household sector --buoyed by a recovering labor market, reduced oil prices, and                                                  3 Growth in gross domestic income (GDI) has not slowed as much as GDP growth recently."
" However, the average of GDP and GDI growth has still slowed recently from an average annual rate of 2 -1/2 percent from the third quarter of 2013 to the third quarter of 2015 to an average of 1 -1/2 percent in the past two quarters."
  - 4 - low interest rates --and has been pulled down by weak  business investment and net exports.
" The rise in the dollar and decline in foreign  growth reduced demand for American exports , as well as  profit s and investment  at U.S. firms, which were also adversely affected by declines in the price of oil."
" Risks  to the Outlook  Of course, there are risks  to the projection that future GDP growth will be strong enough to deliver progress on inflation and employment ."
" In recent months, capital outflow s in China have moderated as pressures on the exchange rate have eased."
" Should exchange rate pressures reemerge, we cannot rule out a re currence of financial stress, which would affect not only China but also other emerging markets that are linked to China via supply chains or commodity export s and, ultimatel y, conditions here."
"  China  is making a challenging  transition  from export - to domestic demand -led growth , and the cost of reallocating  resources from excess capacity  sectors to more dynamic sectors c ould further impair growth in the near term ."
" Growth in the advanced economies remains dependent on extraordinary unconventional monetary policy  accommodation , while conventional policy continues to be constrained  by the zero lower bound ."
" Conventional policy, wh ose efficacy  is more tested and better understood than unconventional policies, can respond readi ly to upside surprises to demand, but presently would be constrained in  adjust ing to downside  - 6 - surprises."
 It also may amplify the sensitivity of exchange rates.
"  Indeed, the evidence suggests that over the past year, dollar exchange rate movements have become considerably greater in response to U.S. monetary policy surprises t han previously.4  The evidence that the  sensitivity of exchange rate movements ha s been elevated lately  is consistent with recent research suggesting that cross border financial transmission is likely to be amplified at nearzero interest rates  where the a bility to provide additional support through domestic channels in response to negative s hocks may be viewed as limited .5  In this environment, markets have become quite sensitive to the possibility of a prolonged period of low growth, low inflation,  and ec onomic underperformance."
" Prior to the Great Recession, the term premium was positive, as bond investors seem  to have been most concerned about the risk that inflation would be higher than expected."
" But sinc e the Great Recession, the term premium has been persistently negative, suggesting that investors have instead been focused on the risk of prolonged lower -thanexpected inflation  in the context of low growth and underperformance .6                                                    4 Recent research by Federal Reserve staff  suggests that over the past year, a surprise of 25 basis point s in the Federal Funds rate following FOMC announcements has trigger ed dollar  appreciation of over 5 percent, although the confidence interval is extremely large, and the coef ficient has varied substantially over time , including intervals when the relationship has been negative."
" In addition, some have suggested the low term premium could reflect an “insurance”  - 7 - Thus, while the easing in financial conditions since mid -February is very welcome, it is important to recognize that some of the conditions underlying recent bouts of turmoil largely remain in place , and an important reason for the fading of this turbulence was the expectation o f more gradual U.S. monetary policy  tightening .7  Should an event trigger renewed fears about global growth or a reassessment of the policy reaction function in the United States, turbulence could well return."
" While signs of weakness in business investment and global demand remain, consumption and residential investment have held firm, and the labor market has moved closer to full employment."
"  At the sa me time, the relative stabilization in the dollar and oil prices in recent months ha s boosted somewhat the likelihood of a return to 2 percent inflation over the medium term."
" However, the data on progress toward our inflation objective  are equivocal ."
" Mea sures of underlying inflation have yet to convincingly signal a move back to 2 percent , and inflation expectations a ppea r low , as I noted earlier ."
I want to emphasize that monetary policy is data dependent and is not on a preset course.
"7 For an estimate of the role of U.S. monetary policy in offsetting the recent tightening in financial conditions, see Del Negro, Giannoni, and Smith (2016)."
 This is especially true since the feedback loop through exchange rate and financial market channels appear s to be elevated .
"Indeed , several factors suggest  that the appropriate path to return monetary policy to a neutral stance  could turn out to be  quite shallow and gradual  in the medium term."
" In particular, it appears likely that the medium -term neutral rate, or the real federal funds rate consistent with the economy remaining at full employment and 2 percent inflation , may be quite low ."
" With productivity running very low, substantial overcapacity and disinflationary pressures abroad, and less favorable demographics, the neutral rate may be lower and today’s  federal  funds rate closer to neutral than previously  anticipated."
"  - 9 - As a result, it appears more likely that much of the  decline in the neutral rate is likely to prove persistent , consistent  with a variety of estimates .8   One likely explanation for this persisten ce is the sharp drop -off in potential output growth sinc e the Great Recession."
" From 1953 to 2003 , pote ntial output growth varied between 3 and 4 -1/2 percent , with one brief exception , according to the Congressional Budget Office."
 Another has been a marked  slowing in productivity growth.
" Over the six years from the end of 2009 to the end of 2015, productivity grew  only a little over 1/2 percent per year, compared with average growth of  21/4 percent over the 50 years prior to the Great Recession.9   The re asons for such a dramatic slowing in productivity growth are not clear."
" Possible explanations include the fading of a one -time boost to productivity from information technology in the  late 1990s and early 2000s; the reduced movement of resources fr om the least productive  to the most productive firms, including new businesses, perhaps due to greater financial constraints for new and small businesses ; and a delay between the introduction of new technologies, such as robotics, genetic sequencing, and artifici al intelligence, and their effect on new production processes and products .10                                                    8 See, for example, Laubach and Williams (2015) ; the estimates from the dynamic stochastic general equilibrium  models cited in Yellen (2015) ; the median estimated neutral rate from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s most recent  Survey of Market Participants ( Federal Reserve Bank of New York, 2016) ; and Johannsen and Mertens  (2016)."
" 9 Since the end of 2007, the average annual gain in productivity has been 1.1 percent."
