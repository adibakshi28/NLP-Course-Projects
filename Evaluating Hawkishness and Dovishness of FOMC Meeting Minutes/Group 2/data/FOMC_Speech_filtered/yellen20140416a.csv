"For release on delivery  12:25 p.m. EDT   April 16, 2014       Monetary Policy and the Economic Recovery     Remarks by   Janet L."
"  It is a sign of how far the eco nomy has come that a return to full employment is, for the first time since the crisis, in the medium -term outlooks  of many forecasters."
  Today I will discuss how my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) and I view the state of the economy and how this view is likely to shape our efforts to  promote a return to maximum employment in a context of price stability .
" While monetary policy discussions naturally begin with a baseline outlook, the path of the economy is  uncertain , and effective policy must respond to significant unexpected  twists and turns the economy may take ."
"  - 2 - The Current Economic Outlook  The FOMC’s current outlook for continued, moderate growth is little changed from last fall."
" The unemployment rate, at 6.7 percent, has fallen  three -tenths  of 1 percentage point since late last year ."
" Broader measures of unemployment that  include  workers  marginally attached  to the labor force and those working part  time for economic reasons have fallen a bit more than the headline unemployment rate, and labor forc e participation , which had been falling, has ticked up this year."
"  Inflation , as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures , has slowed from an annual rate of about 21/2 percent  in early  2012 to  less than 1  percent in February of t his year.1  This rate is well below the Committee’s 2 percent longer -run objective."
  Many advanced economies are observing a similar softness in inflation.
" To some extent,  the low rate of  inflation  seems due to influences t hat are likely to be temporary, including a deceleration in consumer energy prices  and outright declines in core import prices in recent quarters ."
" Longer -run inflation expectations have remained remarkably steady, however."
" W e anticipate  that, as the effects of transitory factors subside and as labor market gains continue , inflation will gradually move back toward 2 percent."
                                                  1 These inflation rates  are based on 12month changes.
"  - 3 - In sum, the central tendency of FOMC participant projections for the unemployment rate at the end of 2016 is 5.2 to 5.6 percent, and for inflation the central tendency is 1.7 to 2 percent."
"2  If this forecast was to become reality, the economy would be approaching what my colleagues and I view as maximum employment and price stability  for the first time in nearly a decade ."
" Three Big Questions for the FOMC  Because the course of the economy is uncertain, monetary policy makers need to carefully watch for signs that it is diverging from the baseline  outlook and then respond in a syst ematic way ."
 Let me turn first to monitoring and discuss three questions I believe are likely to loom large in the FOMC’s ongoing assessment of where we are on the path back to maximum employment and price stability .
" One of the FOMC’s objectives is to promote a return to maximum employment, but exactly what conditions are consistent with maximum employment can be difficult to assess."
" Thus far in the recovery and to this day, there is  little question that the economy has remained far from maximum employment, so measurement difficulties were not  our focus ."
" But as the attainment of our maximum employment goal draws nearer, it will be nec essary for the                                                  2 These figures  are based on the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) submitted in conjunction with the March 2014 FOMC meeting."
" As the FOMC’s statement on longer -term goals and policy strategy emphasizes, these judgments are inherently uncertain and must be based on a wide range of indicators.3   I will refer to the shortfall in employment relative to its mandate -consistent level as labor market slack , and there are a number of different indicators of this slack."
 Probably the best single indicator is the unemployment rate.
" At 6.7 percent, it is now slightly more than 1 percentage point above the 5.2 to 5.6 percent central tendency of the Committee ’s projections for  the longer -run normal unemployment rate."
" This sh ortfall remains significant , and in our baseline outlook, it  will take more than two  years to close.4   Other data suggest that there may be more  slack in labor markets than indicated by the unemployment rate ."
" Similarly, while the share of workers in the labor force who are unemployed and have been looking for work for more than six  months has fallen from its peak in 2010, it  remains as high as any time  prior to the Great Recession.5  There is ongoing debate about why long -term unemployment remains so high and the degree to which it might decline                                                   3 See the FOMC’s  Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, as amended effective January 28, 2014, which is available on the Board’s website at http://federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_LongerRunGoals.pdf ."
"5 The share  in CPS employment of persons working part  time for economic reasons rose from 3 percent prior to the recession to 6.5 percent in November 2009, and it has since then declined only to 5 percent."
" As I argue d more fully in a recent speech, I  believe that longterm unemployment might  fall appreciably if economic conditions were stronger.6  The low level of l abor force participation may also signal additional slack  that is not reflected in the headline unemploy ment rate."
"  As the extent of slack we see today diminishes, however, the FOMC will need to monitor these and other labor market indicators closely to judge how much slack remains and, therefore, how accommodative monetary policy should be."
Is inflation moving back t oward 2 percent?
" A second question that is likely to figure heavily in our assessment of the recovery is whether inflation is moving back toward the FOMC’s 2 pe rcent longer -run objective , as envisioned in our baseline outlook."

"  - 6 - emphasizes, inflation persistently below 2 percent could pose risks to economic performance."
" The FOMC strives to avoid inflation slipping too far below i ts 2 percent objective because, at very low inflation rates , adverse economic developments could more easily push the  economy into deflation."
" The limited historical experience with deflation shows that, once it starts, deflation can become entrenched and associated with prolonged periods of very weak economic performance.8 A persistent bout of very low inflation carries other risks as well."
" With the federal funds rate currently near its lower limit, lower inflation translates into a higher real value for th e federal funds rate, limiting the capacity of monetary policy to support the economy.9  Further, with longer -term inflation expectations anchored near 2 percent in recent years, persistent inflation well below this expected value increases the real burd en of debt for  households and firms , which may put a drag on economic activity."
   I will mention two  considerations that will be important in assessing whether inflation is likely to move back to 2 percent  as the economy recovers.
" First, we anticipate that, as labor market slack diminishes, it will exert less of a drag on inflation."
" However, during the recovery, very high levels of slack have seemingly not generated strong downward pressure on inflation."
" 9 If firms’ and households’ spending decisions depended only on longer -term interest rates, temporarily higher short -term real interest rates due to low inflation at a time that nominal interest rates are constrained by the zero lower bound woul d have little economic effects, provided that these higher short -term real interest rates would be expected to be compensated by lower short -term real interest rates later on."
" However, to the extent that these spending decisions depend in part on shorter -term real interest rates, low inflation can induce meaningful economic costs."
"  - 7 - diminishing slack is helping return inflation to our objective.10  Second, our baseline projection rests on the view that  inflation expectations will remain  well  anchored near 2 percent and provide a natural pull back to that level."
" Finally, the FOMC is well aware that inflation could also threaten to rise substantially above  2 percent."
" At present, I rate the chances of this happening a s significantly below the chances of inflation persisting below 2 percent, but we must always be prepared to respond to such unexpected outcomes , which leads us to my third question."

Private -sector forecasters polled in the April 2010 Blue  Chip survey were predicting that the unemployment rate would fall steadily to 8.6 percent in  the final quarter of 2011.11   This forecast proved quite accurate --the unemployment rate averaged 8.
" In April 2010, Blue  Chip forecasters not only expected falling unemployment , they also expected the FOMC to soon begin raising the federal funds rate."
"3 percent by the second quarter of 2011.12  By July  2010, however, with growth disappointing  and the FOMC expressing concerns a bout softening in both growth and inflation,  the Blue  Chip forecast of the federal funds rate in mid -2011 had fallen to 0.8 percent, and by October the forecasters expected that the rate would remain in the range of 0 to 25 basis point s throughout 2011, as  turned out to be the case.13  Not only did expectations of policy tightening recede, the FOMC also initiated a new $600 billion asset purchase program in November 2010."
" These forecasts were similar to the central tendency of FOMC participants’ projections for the unemployment rate at the end of 2011 submitted in conjunction with the April 2010 FOMC meeting, which ranged from 8.1 to 8.5 percent."
" In the statement following its August 10, 2010, meeting, the FOMC noted that “the pace of recovery in output and employment has slowed in recent months.”  See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2010), “FOMC Statement,” press release, August 10, www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20100810a.htm."
"  - 9 - Thus, while the reductions in the unemployment rate through 2011 were roughly as forecast in early 2010, this improvement only came  about  with the FOMC providing a considerably higher level of accommodation than originally anticipated."
" In April 2011, Blue  Chip forecasters expect ed the unemployment rate to fall to 7.9 percent  by the fourth quarter of 2012, with the  FOMC expected to have already raised t he federal funds rate to near 1  percent by mid -2012.14   As it turned out, the unemployment rate forecast was once more remarkably accurate, but again this was associated with considerably more accommodation than anticipated."
" In response  to signs of slowing economic activity , in August 2011 the FOMC  for the first time expressed its forward guidance in terms of the calendar, stating that conditions would likely warrant exceptionally low levels for  the federal funds rate at least through mid -2013."
"15  Thus, i n both 2011 and 2012, the unemployment rate actually declined by about as much as had been forecast the previous year, but only after unexpected weakness prompted additional accommodative steps by the Federal Reserve."
 - 10 - market recovery on track .16  These episodes illustrate what I described earlier as a vital aspect o f effective monetary policymaking:  monitor the economy for signs that events are unfolding in a materially different manner than expected and adjust policy  in response in a systematic manner.
 Policy Challenges in an Unprecedented Recovery  Fundamental to modern thinking on central banking is the idea that monetary policy is more effective when the public better understands and anticipates how the central bank will respond to evolving economic conditions.
 Monetary policy will thus have an “ automatic stabilizer ” effect  that operates  through private -sector  expectations .
" But by responding to changing circumstances, policy can be most effective at reducing  uncertainty about the course of inflation and employment."
"Bernanke (2012), “Monetary Policy since the Onset of the Crisis,” speech delivered at “The Changing Policy Landscape,” a symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, held in Jackson Hole, Wyo., August 30September  1, www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20120831a.htm ."
 Many studies confirmed that the appropriate response of policy  to those shocks could be described with a fair degree of accuracy by a simple  rule linking the federal funds rate to the shortfall or excess of  employment and inflation relative to their desired values.17  The famous Taylor rule  provides one such formula .18   The idea that monetary policy should react in a systematic manner in order to blunt the effects of shocks has remained central in the FOMC’s policymaking during this recovery.
"Williams (201 1), “Simple and Robust Rules for Monetary Policy,” chap."
"  More recently, the Federal Reserve, and I might add, other central banks around the world, have sought to incorporate this automatic stabilizer  feature in their communications.20  In December 2012, the Committee reformulated its forward guidance, stating that it anticipated that the federal funds rate would remain near zero at least as long as the unemployment rate remained above 6 -1/2 percent, inflation over the period between one and two years ahead was projected to be no more than half a                                                  19 The references to “some time,” “an ex tended period,” “mid -2013,” “late 2014,” and “mid2015” appeared in the FOMC statements of, respectively, December 2008, March 2009, August 2011, January 2012, and September 2012."
" - 13 - percentage point above the Committee’s objective, and longer -term inflation expectations continued to be well anchored."
" When these thresholds were announced, the unemployment rate was reported to be 7.7 percent , and the Committee projected that the 6 -1/2 percent threshold would not be reached for another 21/2 years --in mid -2015."
" When the program began, the rate of purchases was $85 billion per month, and the Committee indicated that purchases would continue, providing that inflation remained well behaved, until there was a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market.22 Based on the cumulative progress towa rd maximum employment since the initiation of the program and the improvement in the outlook for the labor market , the FOMC began reducing the pace of asset purchases last December, stat ing that “[ i]f                                                  21 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Sy stem (2012), “Transcript of Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference, December 12, 2012,” www.federalreserve.gov/mediacenter/files/FOMCpresconf20121212.pdf ."
"  - 14 - incoming information broadly supports the Committee’s expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market  conditions and inflation moving back toward its longer -term objective , the Committee  will likely reduce the pace of asset purchases in further measured steps at future meetings .”23  Purchases are currently proceeding at a pace of $55 billion per month."
" While one of the  main motivation s for this change was that the unemployment rate might soon cr oss the 61/2 percent threshold, the new formulation  is also well  suited to help the FOMC explain policy adjustments that may arise in response to changes in the outlook."
" Specifically, in determining how long to maintain the current target range of 0 to 25 basis point s for the federal funds rate, “ the Committee will assess progress, both realized and expected, toward its objectives of maximum emplo yment and 2 percent inflation.”24  In other words , the larger the shortfall of employment or inflation from the ir respective objectives,                                                  23 See Bo ard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2013), “Federal Reserve Issues FOMC Statement,” press release, December 18, www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20131218a.htm ."
" The new guidance also reaffirms the FOMC’s view that decisions about liftoff should not be based on any one  indicator, but that it will take into account a wide  range of information on the labor market, inflation, and financial developments."
" At present, the Committee anticipates that economic and financial conditions will likely warrant maintaining the current range “for the federal funds rate for a consi derable time after the asset purchase program ends, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee’s 2 percent longer -run goal, and provided that longer -term inflation expectations remain well anchored .”25   Finally, the Committee be gan explaining more fully how policy may operate in the period after liftoff, indicating its expectation that economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping short -term interest rates below levels the Committee views as likely to prove normal in th e longer run."
" The expectation that the achievement of our economic objectives will likely require low real interest rates for some time is again not confined to the United States but is shared broadly across many                                                  25 See Board of Governors, “Federal Reserve Issues FOMC Statement,” March 19 , 2014, in note 24."
"Conclusion  In summary, the policy framework I  have described reflects the F OMC’s commitment to systematically respond to unforeseen economic developments in order to promote a return to maximum employment in a context of price stability."
