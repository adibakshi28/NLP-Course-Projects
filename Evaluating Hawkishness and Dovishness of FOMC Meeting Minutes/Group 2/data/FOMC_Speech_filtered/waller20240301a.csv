"Monetary Policy Forum    New York, New Y ork        March 1 , 2024    Thank you, it is great to be here."
"  Often  called “largescale asset purchases” (LSAP s) by central bankers, the view of quantitative easing, or  QE, as a tool to add monetary policy accommodation and QT to tighten policy has changed over time."
" The alternative view, based on market segmentation or preferred habitat theory, is that when a central bank  uses reserves to pay for government  securities, it is decreasing the supply of these securities  to private investors , which will bid up the price and lower the interest rate on government securities.2  By lowering interest rates on longer -maturity  2 There are several theories for how QE works."
" The market segmentation theory suggests that assets of different maturities are imperfect substitutes , so a lower supply of longterm assets and a higher supply of short -term assets  would imply that long -term interest rates fall and shortterm interest rates rise ."
" The  - 3 - assets, which pay a higher interest rate than reserves, the central bank can stimulate the economy in a manner similar to  lowering the policy rate."
" The Execution of Q uantitative E asing versus Q uantitative T ightening  Turning to the impact of QE and QT on interest rates, analysis often focuses on the term premium."
" As soon as an asset purchase program is announced, these expectations are formed, result ing in the term premium effect , or TPE, on interest rates."
 Let me talk about three factors that affect both the expected path of asset purchases  and interest rates.
"  First, there are two ways that QE can be implemented, and they have different impacts on interest rates."
" So if one wants a particular impact on interest rates at the announcement date, one might lean toward a closed -ended program or be aware that additional guidance on the expected path of the openended program will be needed."
" An example of an openended program is from December 2020, when  the FOMC  stated it would keep buying $120 billion per month in securities “until substantial further progress has been made toward the Committee ’s maximum employment and price stability goals ”; see paragraph 4 of the December 2020 FOMC s tatement , which is available on the Board’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm ."
" If QE is viewed as nothing more than a permanent injection of money into the economy, it would likely create inflation."
" This was widely predicted back in 2009, but the inflation didn’t happen."
 Precommitting to QT is what allows the injection of reserves into the  economy without inflation or other longer -run distortions of market pricing.
 The endpoint should be related to the expectation of the banking system’s demand for reserves.
 T he level of reserves likely  went a bit too low.6  Learning from our experiences and trying to understand how the demand for reserves has changed over time suggests moving carefully toward the endpoint of QT.
" 5 See Jane Ihrig and Chris Waller (2024) , “The Federal Reserve’ s Responses to the P ostCOVID Period of High Inflation, ” FEDS Notes (Washington:  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,  February 14), https://doi.org/10.17016/23807172.3455."
" First, as I mentioned earlier, they find central banks’ QT announcements have only a small effect on interest rates."
"10 See Lael Brainard (2022), “Variation in the Inflation Experiences of Households,” speech delivered at the Spring 2022 Institute Research Conference, Opportunity and Inclusive Growth Institute, Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, Minneapolis, April 5, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/brainard20220405a.htm ."
 One could also argue that it matters because knowing the buyers helps one understand the transmission of QT to asset prices and interest rates.
" My interpretation is that it reinforces the view that the demand for U.S. Treasury securities is broad and deep—the buyers are not a narrow set of deep -pocket ed, sophisticated investors but rather the American public."
 By “ normalizing ” I mean reducing the size of the balance sheet  but retaining enough assets to manage monetary policy using an amplereserves regime.
" They do not imply anything about the stance of interest rate policy, which is focused on infl uencing the macroeconomy and achieving our dual mandate."
" Agency MBS holdings have been slow to run off the portfolio, at a recent monthly average of about $15 billion, because the underlying mortgages have very low interest rates  and prepayments are quite small ."
