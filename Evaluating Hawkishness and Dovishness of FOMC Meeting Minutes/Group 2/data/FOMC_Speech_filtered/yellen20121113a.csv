" Rather, it is the product of adva nces in our understandi ng of how to make monetary policy most effective."
 A gr owing body of research  and experience demonstrates that clear communi cation is itself a vital tool for increasing the efficacy and reliability of monetary policy.
"  In this extraordin ary environment, the Federal Reserve is employing two unconventiona l policy tools to spur job creation and growth:  largescale asset purchases, whic h some people call quantitative easing, and communications about the future course of  monetary policy, also known as forward guidance."
" In addition, with regard to forward guidance, the Committee said that, first, it intends to continue buying MBS and other assets until it sees a subs tantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market.2  Second, the Committee stated that it expect s a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy to remain appropriate  for a considerable time after the economic recovery strengthens."
" To better explain my views regarding the FOMC’s forward guidance, I will first discuss how it fits into the Committee’s broader thinking and communication about monetary policy."
- 3 -  FOMC took a major step to explain this thinki ng last January when it issued for the first time a “Statement of LongerRun Goals and Policy Strategy.”3  This statement provides a concise description of the FOMC’s objectives in conducti ng monetary policy and the approach the Committee considers appropriate to achieve them.
" The Case for Central Bank Transparency To fully appreciate the recent revoluti on in central bank communication and its implications for current policy, it is useful to recall that for decades, the conventional wisdom was that secrecy about the centra l bank’s goals and actions actually makes monetary policy more effective."
" In 1977, wh en I started my first job at the Federal Reserve Board as a staff economist in the Di vision of Internationa l Finance, it was an article of faith in central banking that secrecy about monetary policy decisions was the best policy:  Central banks, as  a rule, did not discuss these de cisions, let alone their future policy intentions."

"- 4 -  stable prices and maximum employment, Federa l Reserve officials at that time avoided discussing how policy would be used to pursue both sides of this mandate."
" Indeed, mere mention of the employment side of the ma ndate, even by the mid1990s, was described in a New York Times  article as the equivalent of “stick ing needles in the eyes of central bankers.”4      This secretiveness regarding monetary policy decisions clashed with the openness regarding government decisions expected in a democracy, especi ally since Federal Reserve decisions influence the lives of ever y American."
" Indee d, in 1975 a citizen demanding greater openness sued the FOMC to obtain immediate release of the policy directiv e upon its adoption, and in 1981 the case was resolved in favor of deferred disclosure.6   Ironically, while this transparency lawsuit was wending its way through the courts, Robert Lucas and others were publis hing research that would garner several Nobel prizes and ultimately overturn the tradi tional wisdom that secrecy regarding policy                                                  4 See Keith Bradsher (1994), “ToughDecision Time fo r the Federal Reserve; New Vice Chairman Stirs the Board’s Pot,” New York Times , September 26, www.nytimes.com/1994/09/26/business/toughdecision-timefor-federalreserve-newvice-chairmanstir sboard-spot.html?pag ewanted=all&src=pm."

"- 5 -  actions was the best policy.7  A key insight of these scholars was that monetary policy affects employment, incomes, and inflation to a large extent through its effects on the public’s expectations about future policy."
" Many spending decisions , such as financing the purchase of a home or businesses’ cap ital expenditures, depend on longerterm interest rates that are connect ed to monetary policy through expectations of shortterm interest rates over the lifetime of a mortgage or an investment project."
" In other words, the effect of monetary policy on the economy today depends not  only, or even primarily, on the FOMC’s current target for the federal f unds rate or the quantity of assets on its balance sheet, but rather on how the public expe cts the Federal Reserve to set the paths of these variables in the future."
 These expecta tions influence longerterm interest rates and asset prices as well as the public’s views con cerning the likely future paths of income and inflation.
" In the 1970s, two large oil price shocks led to sharp in creases in general infl ation that were not met with prompt inflationfighting actions by the Federal Reserve."
" This delay left the public unsure whether the Federal Reserve would act to reverse the increase in inflation, and expectations of longerterm inflation ratcheted up."
" When the Federal Reserve eventually did act to bring inflation down from doubledigit levels, the consequence was the painful recession of 1981 and 1982."
" The effects of that policy shift were severe, but the decision helped change expectations of the Federal Reserve’s co mmitment to price stability, and thereby ultimately led to longerrun infl ation expectations becoming anchored at their current low                                                  7 While Robert Lucas mainly analyzed models in whic h only monetary surprises have any effect on real activity, his important insight in the present c ontext was that the perceived monetary policy rule is critical in determining the effects of monetary policy actions, both anticipated and unanticipated."
" As a result, a series of large increas es in oil prices starti ng in 2005 did not unleash a general rise in inflation or longerterm in flation expectations."
 The public seemed to correctly perceive that the Federal Reserve would not al low an oil price shock to precipitate a general rise in inflation.
" Longerterm inflati on expectations remained well anchored, and hence no aggressive and recessionary disinflation action by the Federal Reserve was required."
" Thus, over the quarter  century up to the mid2000s, the Federal Reserve established a record of  policymaking that allowed the public to predict monetary policy responses to unforeseen events such  as an oil price shock with reasonable accuracy."
"  Unfortunately, recent events have made it harder for the public to predict the future course of monetary policy."
 Economic weakness since the fina ncial crisis and the Great Recession has confounded hopes for a speedy recovery and has required unprecedented monetary policy actions.
"  With the federal funds rate near zero, and the Federal Reserve deploying the new tool of largescale asset purchases, it b ecame much more difficult for the public to anticipate how the FOMC would likely conduc t policy over time, and how the overall - 7 -  stance of monetary policy would both affect and respond to economic conditions."
"  - 8 -  participants’ forecasts for the economy under their individual views concerning appropriate policy and their longerrun asse ssments of potential output growth, the “normal” unemployment rate, and the mo st appropriate inflation rate."
   A high priority for the Chairman was to further clarify the FOMC’s interpretation of the longterm objectives implied by its dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices.
" But beyond that, an explicit statement of goals had become essential for the Committee to achieve its monetary policy objectives in the aftermath of the crisis, including allowing heavier reliance than in the past on forward guidance on the future path of policy."
"  A particular concern, given that the crisis had ushere d in a prolonged period of elevated unemployment, was that the wea kness in the economy might push inflation well below 2 percent, a level that many took to be  an implicit target of the FOMC."
 There was even an ongoing risk that low inflation mi ght turn to deflation and further hamper growth.
" These challenges led to legitimat e questions among forecasters and the public about just what the FOMC meant by “maxim um employment” and “stable prices.”    The FOMC could have chosen to adopt an “inflationtargeting framework,” in which it would have specified an objective so lely for inflation, without any explicit reference to employment."
" While the FOMC had debated adopting an inflation target on a number of occasions since the mid1990s , some Committee members believed that - 9 -  stating an explicit target fo r inflation alone would undermine the maximumemployment side of the dual mandate."
" In fact, some cen tral banks that have been assigned a single mandate of inflation stabilization have strugg led to explain how the goals of growth and financial stability figure into th eir inflationtargeting framework.11 A Consensus on Monetary Policy Goals  Last January, the FOMC took a major step to clarify its interpretation of its dual mandate, issuing the “Statement of Longe rRun Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy” that I mentioned earlier."
" Importantly, the consensus statement provi des a numerical value--2 percent--for the Committee’s longerrun inflation goal."
" Bu t importantly, it pairs that inflation goal with a specific goal for maximum employment."
" In particular, the st atement cites a range summarizing FOMC participants’ estima tes of the longerrun normal rate of unemployment."
" Finally, the statement says that the Committee will follow a “balanced                                                  11 See, for example, the discussions in Lars E.O. Svensson (1999), “Inflation Targeting as a Monetary Policy Rule,” Journal of Monetary Economics , vol."

"- 10 -  approach” as it “seeks to mitig ate deviations of inflation from its longerrun goal and deviations of employment from the Committee’s assessments of its maximum level.”12  The specification of 2 percent as the Co mmittee’s longerrun inflation goal, as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), reflected careful deliberation."
" First, any rate of price inflation, whether positive or negative, imposes some costs on society, making planning more difficult and creating distortions in the ec onomy."
" Second, were the FOMC to aim for zero inflation to eliminate these costs, it would face greater difficulty in providing sufficient monetary accommodation in response to  large negative shocks."
" With inflation at zero, the zero lower bound on nominal inte rest rates implies that real shortterm interest rates cannot be reduced below zero."
" In contrast, with low but positive inflation, they can be.13  History has shown that sustained periods of even mild deflation can impose immense costs in terms of slow growth and high unemployment.14  Thus, balancing the goal of maximum employment ag ainst the costs of modest inflation, the Committee chose 2 percent measured inflation as  the value it judged likely to provide an adequate buffer against costly deflations while  keeping the costs of inflation quite small."
"  Given that the rate of inflation over th e longer run is determined solely by monetary policy, central banks can, and ind eed must, determine the longrun level of                                                  12 See Board of Governors,  “FOMC Statement of LongerRun Goals and Policy Strategy,” in note 3."
"13 Due to wellknown upward biases in the PCE and other indexes of consumer prices as measures of the cost of living, zero inflation, properly measured, corre sponds to a positive measured  level of PCE inflation, most likely on the order of 1/2 percent."
- 11 -  inflation.
" In contrast, they cannot do much to affect the maximum sustainable level of employment."
" Nonetheless, the Committee felt strongly that it should provide  some quantitative interpretation of economic conditions consis tent with the maximum employment portion of the Fed’s mandate."
 Failure to do so might be  seen as elevating the inflation side of the dual mandate above the employment side.
 The Committee chose to couch the longerrun employment objective in terms of the rate of unemployment while indicating that other indicators may also be relevant in as sessing the maximum level of employment.
" Unfortunately, there is a considerable range of disagreement in the economics profession and on the FOMC itself about what this longerrun normal rate of unemployment is."
 I expect the FOMC to review it s estimates of the longerrun normal rate of unemployment in its annual reaffirmation of the consensus statement on goals and strategy.
" Because shocks to the economy regularly push inflation and unemployment away from th e Committee’s objectives, the FOMC must adjust policy to mitigate such deviations from its goals."
" We can therefore think of two - 12 -  tasks for monetary policymakers:  first, se tting policy to pursue th e longerrun objectives; and second, adjusting policy in response to s hocks to minimize shorterrun fluctuations around those objectives."
" In the words of the January consensus statement, “communicating this inflation goa l clearly to the public helps keep longerterm inflation expectations firmly anchored, thereby foster ing price stability and moderate longterm interest rates and enhancing the Committee’ s ability to promote maximum employment in the face of significant economic disturbances.”15   Put differently, the purpose of providing greater clarity about the FOMC’s longerrun inflation goal is to anchor inflation exp ectations more firmly."
 These more firmly anchored expectations in turn free the Comm ittee’s hand to more actively and effectively stabilize shortrun fluctuations in economic activity.
 The Committee can act in this way because the FOMC can tolerate transitory deviations of inflation from its objective in order to more forcefully stabilize employmen t without needing to worry that the public will mistake these actions as the pursuit of a hi gher or lower longrun inflation objective.
" The instability of inflation, in flation expectations, and employ ment in response to the oil price increases of the 1970s vi vidly illustrates the threat posed by price shocks when longerterm inflation expectations are not well anchored."
"To minimize shortrun fluctuations, th e FOMC also needs to decide how to respond to shocks that push the economy away from price stability and maximum employment."
" The goals of stable pr ices and maximum employment are often                                                  15 See Board of Governors,  “FOMC Statement of LongerRun Goals and Policy Strategy,” in note 3."
" For example, returning inflati on to its longerrun goal might require, say, a tighter stance of monetary policy, wher eas returning the economy to maximum employment might require just the opposite."
 The balancedapproach strategy endorsed by the FO MC is consistent with the view that maximum employment and price stability sta nd on an equal footing as objectives of monetary policy.
" The first is that, if the FOMC is doing its best to minimize deviations from its objectives, then, over long periods, both unemp loyment and inflation will be about equally likely to fall on either side of thos e objectives."
" To put it simply, if 2 percent inflation is the Committee’s goal, 2 percent cannot be viewed as a ceiling for inflation because that would result in deviations that  are more frequently below 2 percent than above and thus not properly bala nced with the goal of maximum employment."
" Instead, to balance the chances that inflation will sometim es deviate a bit above and a bit below the goal, 2 percent must be treate d as a central tendency around which inflation fluctuates."
 The same holds true for fluctuations of unemployment around its longerrun normal rate.
" In particular, reducing inflation may sometimes require a monetary tightening th at will lead to a temporary rise in unemployment."
" And a policy that reduces  unemployment may, at times, result in inflation that could temporar ily rise above its target."
" In addition to clearly specified goa ls, concrete reco mmendations about appropriate monetary policy require the specification of a baseline outlook for the economy and also a realistic, quantitative mode l of the economy to assess how monetary policy choices affect the likely paths of th e FOMC’s goal variables--namely, inflation and the unemployment rate."
 The baseline paths through 2015 of the unemp loyment rate and inflation shown by the solid black lines in the upper two panels track the medi an of the dealers’ forecasts of these variables.
" Beyond 2015, the path assumes that the unemployment rate converges over time to 6 percent--the me dian forecast of the longrun unemployment rate, which is the upper end of the rang e of estimates of the longerrun normal - 15 -  unemployment rate cited in the FOMC consen sus statement--while the inflation rate settles down at 2 percent, the FOMC’s in flation objective and the median longrun forecast in the dealer survey."
" As I noted, this balanced approach means inflation and unemployment will sometimes temporarily deviate from longerrun objectives, but that these deviations would be minimized."
 The model lets us analyze every possible policy path to see which one yields the best feasible outcome for the paths of unemplo yment and inflation.
" In the simulations that follow, I treat the balance sheet as unchanged relative to its baseline path, and focus on the federal funds rate as the tool for conducting monetary policy even though the Committee is currently using both forward guidance concerning the funds rate path and the balance sheet to provide monetary accommodation."
" To derive a path for the federal funds  rate consistent with the Committee’s enunciated longerrun goals and balanced appro ach, I assume that monetary policy aims to minimize the deviations of inflation fr om 2 percent and the deviations of the unemployment rate from 6 percent, w ith equal weight on both objectives.17  In computing the best, or “optimal policy,” path for the fe deral funds rate to ach ieve these objectives, I will assume that the public fully anticipates that the FOMC will follow this optimal plan and is able to assess its effect on the economy.18    The blue lines with triangles labeled “Op timal policy” show the resulting paths."
" The optimal policy to implement this “balan ced approach” to mini mizing deviations from the inflation and unemployment goals involves keeping the federal f unds rate close to zero until early 2016, about two quarters longer than in the illustrative baseline, and keeping the federal funds rate below th e baseline path through 2018."
" This highly accommodative policy path generates a faster reduction in unemployment than in the baseline, while inflation slightly overshoot s the Committee’s 2 percent objective for several years."
"                                                   17 More precisely, the loss function that the central bank is assumed to minimize is the discounted sum of current and future squared deviations of inflation from 2 percent, current and future squared deviations of the unemployment rate from 6 percent, and current and future quarterly changes in the federal funds rate."
" Provided that longterm inflation expectations are firmly anchored, the federal funds rate is set to ba lance the benefits from a faster reduction of the unemployment rate against the losses fr om a temporary and modest increase of inflation above 2 percent."
" The more rapi d reduction in unemployment along the optimal control path than in the baseline reflects  the stimulus to demand provided by lower nominal and real interest rates, higher asse t prices, and the expectation of more rapid growth in employment and income.19   The computation of an optimal path for monetary policy is obviously complicated, and, as I’ll disc uss, it’s challenging to comm unicate."
" The re d lines with squares labeled “Modified Taylor rule” show the economic outcomes that would be  expected if the federal funds rate were set according to the prescriptions of a rule that  is similar to the original Taylor rule, with the only difference being that it responds e qually to deviations of unemployment and inflation from their respective longerrun values."
   The figure shows that this rule would ra ise the federal funds rate substantially earlier than the optimal path and thereby l eads to more protracted deviations of the unemployment rate above its longerrun norma l level without any measurable gains in keeping inflation closer to the 2 percent target.
" The output gap is approximated using Okun’s law; specifically, Yt = 2.0(6Ut), where 2.0 is the estimated value of the Okun’s law coefficient an d 6 is the assumed value of the nonaccelerating inflation rate of unemployment, or NAIRU."

" While a clear statement of the Committee’s goals and the strategy it will use to achieve them was an important and necessary step in this regard, the exercise we’ve just undertaken illustra tes that a host of additional assumptions and                                                  21 I would note that the original Taylor rule, which pl aces only onehalf as much weight as the modified rule on unemployment deviations, would already have raised the federal funds rate above the zero bound, producing far worse outcomes than any illustrated in figure 1."
  The challenge facing the FOMC now is to  devise ways to communicate its policy intentions during a period in which policy will most likely be c onstrained by the zero bound on shortterm rates and asset purchases w ill be actively used to foster faster growth.
" This later liftoff date is consistent with the Comm ittee’s statement that “a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the economic recovery strengthens.”23  Moreover, the simulations  also suggest that, once liftoff from the zero lower bound occurs, it would be optimal for the federal funds rate to remain for some time below the prescriptions from a rule, such as the modified Taylor rule, that might in the past have prov ided a good guide to the Committee’s action."
" Importantly, this openended plan reflects a goa loriented approach in which the ultimate quantity of asset purchases will be geared to the attainment of sufficient progress toward the Committee’s employment goal."
" That is, the Co mmittee could provide the public  with its projections for inflation and the unemployment rate together with what it views as appropriate paths both for the federal funds rate and its asset holdi ngs, conditional on its current outlook for the economy."
" Improvements along these lines are cu rrently under active consideration.24                                                  24 In the SEP, participants provide paths for the un employment rate, real GDP growth, and inflation that each expects under his or he r own view of the policy that is most  appropriate to achieve the Committee’s dual mandate."
" The SEP currently provides information about the separate distributions of the pr ojections for inflation, real activity, and the federal funds rate over the next few years, but it does not pr ovide the joint paths--that is, multivariate projections."
" The public cannot, for example, infer whether a projection for higher inflation in 2015 was made by a participant who expects real activity to be weak du e to a more pessimistic view about the productive capacity of the economy, or by a par ticipant who expects higher inflatio n in the context of a stronger recovery, perhaps judging, in the spirit of the optimal policy simulations, that somewhat higher inflation is warranted for some time to achieve faster progress in reducing unemployment."
" The idea is to define a zone of combinati ons of the unemployment rate and inflation within which the FOMC would continue to hold the federal funds rate in its current, nearzero range."
" For example, Charles Evans, pres ident of the Chicago Fed, suggests that the FOMC should commit to hold the federal funds ra te in its current low range at least until unemployment has declined below 7 percent, provided that inflation over the medium term remains below 3 percent."
" Narayana Kocherlakota, president of the Minneapolis Fed, suggests thresholds of 5.5 percent for unemployment and 2.25 percent for the mediumterm inflation outlook."
"  - 23 -  Perhaps more importantly, the use of inflation and unemployment thresholds would help the public understand whether a shif t in the calendar date, assuming that one is still included in the statement, reflect s a change in the Committee’s economic outlook or, alternatively, a change in its view  concerning the appropriate degree of accommodation."
" Since monetary policy work s in large part through the public’s perceptions of the FOMC’s systematic be havior, this distinction is critical.25 Conclusion  The past few years have seen important changes in the FOMC’s communications--innovations that  promote the Federal Reserv e’s accountability to the public."
" Beyond that, I believe better communi cation serves to improve the efficacy of monetary policy at a time when the FOMC faces constraints on its ability to provide appropriate support to the economic recove ry through the federal funds rate, its traditional policy tool."
