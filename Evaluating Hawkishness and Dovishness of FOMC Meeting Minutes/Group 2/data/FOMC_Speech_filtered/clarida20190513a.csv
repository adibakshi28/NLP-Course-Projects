"For release on delivery  9:10 a.m. EDT  May 13 , 2019          The Federal Reserve’s Review of Its Monetary Policy  Strategy , Tools, and Communication  Practices     Remarks by   Richard H."
"Clarida   Vice Chair   Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at  “New England Perspectives on Fed Policymaking:  A ‘ Fed Listens ’ Conference ” hosted by  the Federal Reserve Bank of  Boston   Boston, Massachusetts         May 13 , 2019    I am pleased to attend this Fed Listens  event providing a New England perspective for the Federal Reserve’s  review  of our monetary policy strateg y, tools, and communication practices .1  We are bring ing open minds  to our review  and are seeking  a broad range of perspectives."
"  To us, it simply seems like good institutional prac tice to engage with a wide range of interested individuals and groups as part of a comprehensive approach to enhanced transparency and accountability.2 Motivation for the Review  The Congress charged t he Federal Reserve with achieving a dual mandate —maximum employment and price stability —and this review will take this mandate as given."
 We will also take as given that a 2 percent rate of inflation in the price index for personal consumption expenditures is the operational goal  most consistent with our price -stability mandate.
" That said, based on the experience of other central banks that have undertaken similar reviews, our  review is more likely to produce evolution, not a revolution, in the way we conduct monetary policy ."
"With the U.S. economy operating at or close to our maximum -employment and pricestability  goals , now is an especially opportune time for this review."
" The unemployment rate is at  a 50year low, and inflation is running close to our 2 percent objective."
 2 Fuhrer and others (2018) explore the desirability of comprehensive reviews of the monetary policy framework.
"Perhaps most importantly , neutral  interest  rates appear to have fallen in the United States and abroad.3  This global decline in neutral rates is widely expected to persist for years  and likely reflects several factors, including aging populat ions, changes in risktaking behavior, and a slowdown in technology growth."
" That development, in turn, could make it more difficult during downturns for  monetary  policy  to support  household spending , business investment,  and employment and keep inflation from falling too low .4 Another key development in recent decades is that inflation appears less responsive to resource slack , implying a change in the dynamic relationship bet ween inflation and employment.5  This change is, in a sense, a proverbial double -edged sword."
" It permits the Federal Reserve to support employment more aggressively during                                                  3 For evidence of a fall in neutral rates of interest in the United States and abroad, see, among sev eral contributions, King and Low (2014) ; Holston, Laubach, and Williams (2017) ; Rachel and Smith (201 7); and Brand, Bielecki, and Penalver (2018)."
" 4 For assessments of the risks that U.S. monetary policy will be constrained by the effective lower bound and its implications for economic activity and inflation, see Kiley and Roberts (2017), Erceg and others (2018), Swanson  (2018), and Chung and others (2019)."
 5 The apparent diminished responsiveness of inflation to resource slack is known in economic research  as a flattening of the short -run Phillips curve.
" - 3 - downturns —as was the case during and after the Great Recession —because a sustained inflation breakout is less likely when inflation is less responsive to employment conditions .6  However, that dynamic  also increases the cost, in terms of economic output, of reversing  unwelcome increases in longer -run inflation expectations ."
" Thus, it is all the more  important that longer -run inflation expectations remain anchored at levels consistent with our  2 percent inflation objective .7 Activities and Timeline for the Review  Our monetary policy  review  will have several components.8  The Board and the Reserve Banks are hosting  Fed Listens  events —such as this one in Boston —in which we are hearing  from , among others, business and labor leaders, community development advocates , and academics."
"                                                  6 One potential contributor to the flattening of the Phillips curve is a change in the conduct of monetary policy since the 1980s toward greater stabilization of inflation and economic activity; for evidence of such a change, see Clarida, Galí, and Gertler (2000) ; Boivin and Giannoni (2006) ; and Boivin, Kiley, and Mishkin (2010 )."
" Similarly, the adoption of an explicit inflation objective, along with greater certainty regarding the conduct of monetary policy, can help anchor longer -term inflation expectations and stabilize actual inflatio n in response to shocks."
 7 See Yellen (2015) for a discussion of inflation dynamics and monetary policy ; see Erceg and others (2018) for a quantitative exploration of the monetary policy implications of a flat Phillips curve in an uncertain economic enviro nment.
" Since the mid -1980s, movements in both realized inflation and measures of longer -term inflation expectations have been somewhat muted, complicating the task of extracting the precise role of inflation expectations as a determinant of realized infla tion."
 Faust and Wright (2013) review the literature on inflation forecasting and present evidence in support of the conclusion that measures of inflation expectations help predict the trend in inflation.
" Cecchetti and others (2017) showed that while the level of realized inflation and four -quarter -ahead inflation expectations are positively correlated, changes in these variables have been largely uncorrelated since the mid -1980s."
" These authors suggest that, in a low and stable inflation environment, policymakers should pay attention to a wide array of other indicators in determining the implications of movements in realized inflation and measures of inflation expectations."
"Building on the perspectives we hear and on staff analysis, the F ederal Open Market Committee  will perform  its own assessment of how it conducts  monetary policy, beginning around the middle of the year."
 What I can say is that any changes to our conduct of monetary policy  that we might make will be aimed solely at improving  our ability to achieve and sustain our dual -mandate objectives in the world we live in today.
