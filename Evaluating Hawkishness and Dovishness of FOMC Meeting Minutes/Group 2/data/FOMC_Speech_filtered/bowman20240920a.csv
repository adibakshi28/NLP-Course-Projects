" Given the progress we have seen since the middle of 2023 on both lowering inflation and cooling the labor market, I agree that at this meeting it was appropriate to recalibrate the level of the federal funds rate and begin the process of moving toward a more neutral policy stance."
" The U.S. Economy Remains Strong  The U.S. economy remains strong, with solid underlying growth in economic activity and a labor market near full employment."
 I see the normalization in labor market conditions as necessary to h elp bring wage growth down to a pace consistent with 2 percent inflation given trend productivity growth.
" I am also taking signal from continued solid growth in the spending data, especially consumer spending, reflecting a healthy  labor market."
"   -2Despite P rogress, I nflation  Remains a C oncern  Inflation remains above our 2 percent goal, as core personal consumption expenditures prices are still rising faster than 2.5 percent  from 12 months earlier ."
 Accomplishing our mission of returning to low and stable inflation at  our 2 percent goal is necessary to foster a strong  labor market and an economy that works for everyone in the longer  term.
"  Although it is important to recognize that there has been meaningful progress on lowering inflation, while core inflation remains around or above 2.5 percent, I see the risk that the Committeeâ€™s larger  policy action could be  interpreted  as a premature declaration of victory on our price stability mandate."
  We have not yet achieved our inflation goal.
I believe that moving at a measured pace toward a more neutral policy stance  will ensure f urther  progress i n bringing  inflation down to our 2 percent target .
 This approach would also avoid unnecessarily  stoking demand.
 I remain committed to work ing together with my colleagues to ensure that monetary policy is appropriately positioned to achi eve our goals of maximum employment and returning inflation to our 2 percent target.
