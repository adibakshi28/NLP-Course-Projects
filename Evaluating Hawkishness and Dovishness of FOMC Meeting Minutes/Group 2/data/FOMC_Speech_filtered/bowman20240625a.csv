"For release on delivery  7:00 a.m. E DT (noon local time)  June 25, 2024         Perspectives on U.S. Monetary Policy and Bank Capital Reform     Remarks by   Michelle  W."
" My remarks will offer some perspectives on recent developments in  monetary policy and bank regulatory policy—specifically , bank capital reform —in the U .S."
  Monetary Policy  I’ll begin with monetary policy.
 The  Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) —the monetary policymaking body of the Federal Reserve  System —has been keenly focused on restoring price stability following the surge in inflation during 2021 and in 2022 in the aftermath of the global C OVID19 pandemic .
" During this time , inflation reached levels not seen in the U .S."
 The high inflation experienced in the U .S.
"  In many economies during the pandemic, supply constraints related to social -distancing  measures, reduced labor supply, and supply chain disruptions , coupled with strong demand for goods  as economies emerged from pandemic restrictions, acted as catalysts, pushing inflation up to very high levels."
" Aggregate demand was also supported by accommodative monetary and fiscal policies, which served to bolster the balance  1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee  or the Board of Governors  of the Federal Reserve System ."
" The global inflation experience since the pandemic  was highly synchronized across the major world economies, reflecting similar  shocks that acted to reduce supply, while fiscal and monetary policy interventions stimulated demand."
" Aggressive fiscal policies help ed support personal and business income , and monetary policy became highly accommodative."
 Th e large shift in the composition of demand toward goods resulted in rising supply bottlenecks  and higher goods prices.
  Reduced immigration and lower labor force participation led to very tight labor markets as the economy reopened and demand recovered .
" Wage growth and services pric e inflation also picked up and have remained persistently elevated , reflecting a tight labor market and the protracted adjustment of prices and wages to  the shocks during the pandemic ."
" A sharp rise in food and energy price inflation , and their passthrough to core  inflation , also contributed to a more synchronous inflation dynamic across major advanced foreign economies in recent years ."
 - 3 - Many central banks facing these dynamics tightened monetary policy in an effort to better balance demand and supply and to bring inflation back down to target.
" In the U.S., by late  2021, it became clear that the FOMC ’s monetary policy stance was too accommodative in the presence of growing inflationary pressures , due to broader and more persistent supply constraints, and that the Committee needed to move toward a tighter policy."
" It seems likely to me that the U.S. experience during t he years leading up to the pandemic, when inflation was persistently low, made it hard for many to foresee how quickly that situation could change."
" Additionally , the domestic inflation and labor data di d not accurately reflect the economic conditions prevailing at the time and were subsequently substantially revised.2    In my view , these factors, combined with  new forward guidance introduced in the September and December 2020 FOMC statements following the revisions to the Committee’s monetary policy strategy consensus statemen t in August 2020, contributed to a delay in the removal of monetary policy accommodation in 2021.3,4  In late 2021, the  2 For example, both the August and September 2021 employment reports suggested much lower job growth than did consensus forecasts, and these initial estimates were subsequently sizably increased."
" Similarly, total personal consumption expenditures  (PCE) inflation for nearly all quarters in 2021 has been revised higher than initially reported."

"Bowman (2024), “Risks and Uncertainty in Monetary Policy:  Current and Past Considerations ,” speech delivered at “Frameworks for Monetary Policy, Regulation, and Bank Capital” Spring 2024 Meeting of the Shadow Open Market Committee, hosted by the Manhattan Institute, New York, New York , April 5 , https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240405a.htm ."
  4 The new forward guidance in the September 2020 FOMC  statement emphasized that the federal funds rate would remain near zero until “inflation ha s risen to  2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent  for some time ” (paragraph 4) and “labor market conditions have  reached levels consistent with the Committee’s  assessments of maximum employment”  (paragraph 4).
"  In the December 2020 FOMC statement, the FOMC added forward guidance regarding asset purchases  that stated that  the Federal Reserve  would continue to purchase Treasury and agency mortgage -backed securities at the then current pace of $80 billion and $40 billion per month, respectively,  “until substantial further progress ha s been made toward the Committee ’s maximum employment and price stability goals”  (paragraph 4)."
" (The September and December 2020 FOMC statements are available on the Board’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm .)  The September and December 2020   - 4 - FOMC did begin to move toward tighten ing the stance of monetary policy and , beginning in 2022, increased the policy rate rapidly to bring monetary policy into restrictive territory."
  The tightening in monetary policy has had an effect.
" O ver 2023, we saw significant progress on  lowering inflation in the U .S."
 The restrictive stance of monetary policy reduc ed demandside inflation  pressures.
" Rising  interest rates continued to act as a drag on growth of  residential and business investment , outside of a n increase in construction of new electric vehicle battery and microprocessor factories."
" L abor demand also moderated, contribut ing to some loosening of labor market tightness."
" The job openings  and quits rates fell and payroll employment gains slowed significantly  throughout last year .5 Some of the progress on inflation last year also reflected favorable supplyside developments , including the resolution of supply chain disruptions  and increased labor  forward guidance followed the August 2020 revisions to the FOMC’s Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, which are described on the Board’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/guide -tochanges -instatement -onlonger -rungoals -monetary -policy -strategy.htm ."
 5 The Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) report for the fourth quarter of 2023 suggests that the slowdown in payroll employment gains was likely more pronounced than currently reported by the Current E mployment Statistics (CES) establishment survey.
" The Q4 QCEW administrative data show employment gains that are about 110,000 per month lower than what the CES survey reported from March 2023 to December 2023."
" Although the BLS benchmarks CES payroll employment based on the Q1 QCEW, to be released on August 21 , the Q4 QCEW data point to a substantial downward revision to CES employment gains last year ."
" Since the beginning of 2024, however, we have seen only modest further progress  on inflation."
" The 12month measures of total and core PCE inflation have moved roughly sideways or slightly down since December and remained elevated at 2.7 percent and 2.8 percent, respectively, in April."
 T he consumer price index ( CPI) report for May showed 12month core CPI inflation slowing to 3.4 percent from 3.6 percent  in April.
" However, with average core CPI inflation this year through May running at an annualized rate of 3.8 percent, notably above average inflation in the second half of last year, I expect infl ation to remain elevated for some time."
 Recent  data suggest some moderation in economic activity early this year.
" First -quarter gross domestic product growth was slower than in the second half of last year, though private domestic final purchases continued to rise at a solid pace."
 Continued softness in  consumer spending and weaker housing activity early in  the second quarter  also suggest less momentum in economic activity so far this year .
"  Payroll employment continued to rise at a solid pace in April and May, though slightly slower than in the first quarter, partly reflecting increased immigrant labor supply."
" D espite some further rebalancing between supply and demand, the labor market remains tight."
" T he unemployment rate edged up to 4.0 percent in May, while the number of job openings  relative to unemployed workers declined further to near its pre -pandemic level ."
"  - 6 - In contrast to the past two years, i t is possible over the coming month s that the path of monetary policy in the U .S."
 Inflation and labor market developments in the U .S.
"  Economic activity in the U.S. has recovered considerably more than in other advanced foreign economies , including in the U .K."
" This likely reflects higher levels of fiscal support and productivity growth in the U.S. compared to other major economies.6  A more flexible  labor market in the U.S. likely allowed for greater movement of workers across sectors following the C OVID19 shock, w ith higher unemployment  in the early stages of the pandemic followed by stronger job creation during the recovery."
  A rebound in new business formation in the U.S. also likely enhance d productivity growth in recent years.
" With economic activity remaining weaker  in other advanced foreign economies than in the U.S. and given differing economic and inflation outlooks in their own jurisdictions , central banks in these economies may ease monetary policy sooner or more quickly than in the U.S ."
" Inflation in the U.S. remains elevated, and I still see a number of upside inflation risks that affect my outlook."
"  First, it is unlikely that  further supplyside improvements will continue to lower inflation  going forward, as supply chains have largely normalized,  6 See Francois de Soyres , Joaquin Garcia -Cabo Herrero, Nils Goernemann, Sharon Jeon, Grace Lofstrom, and Dylan Moore (2024) , “Why Is the U .S."
"  Geopolitical developments could also pose upside risks to inflation, including the risk that spillovers from regional conflicts could disrupt global supply chains, putting additional upward pressure on food, energy, and commodity prices."
" There is also the risk that the loosening in financial conditions since last year , reflecting considerabl e gains in equity valuations, and additional fiscal stimulus could add momentum to demand, stalling any further progress or even causing inflation to reaccelerate."
" Finally, there is a risk that increased immigration and continued labor market tightness could lead to persistently high core services inflation."
" With labor markets remaining tight, w age growth has been elevated at around or above  4 percent, still higher than the pace consistent with our 2 percent inflation goal given trend productivity growth."
"In the U.S., t he FOMC pursues monetary policy in support of price stability and maximum employment ."
" However, international economic and financial developments can influence U.S. monetary policy to the extent that these developments affect the  economic outlook for the U .S."
" For example, weaker foreign activity and an appreciation of the dollar drive n by easier monetary policy abroad would both reduce foreign demand for U.S. exports and lower the outlook for economic  - 8 - growth in the U .S."
"  Looking ahead, I will be closely watching the incoming data as I assess whether monetary policy in the U .S."
is sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to our 2 percent goal over time.
" My baseline outlook continues to be that U.S. inflation will return to the FOMC’s 2 percent goal, with the target range of the federal funds rate held at its current level of 5 -1/4 to 5 -1/2 percent for some time ."
" Should the incoming data indicate that inflation is moving sustainably toward our 2 percent goal, it will eventually become appropriate to gradually lower the federal funds r ate to prevent monetary policy from becoming overly restrictive."
" In my view , we should consider a range of  possible scenarios that could unfold when considering how the FOMC’s monetary policy decisions  may evolve ."
 I remain willing to raise the target range for the federal funds rate at a future meeting  should progress on inflation stall or even reverse.
" Reducing our policy rate too soon or too quickly could result in a rebound in inflation, requiring further future policy rate increases to return inflation to 2 percent over the longer run."
 They also overlooked the buildup of interest rate risk without appropriate risk management.
 My experience over the past five and a half years at the Federal Reserve highlights the enduring challenge of setting monetary policy amid a wide and evolving range of risks and uncertainties  in the global economy.
" A n important question I will be considering is how to make monetary policy durable to a wide range of possible shocks and changes in the macroeconomy, such as those experienced globally during the pandemic ."
" While the economic outlook is uncertain, the FOMC ’s mandate of fostering price stability and maximum employment in the U."
 Restoring price stability is essential for achieving maximum employment over the longer run.
