"Waller   Member     Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at the   University of Notre Dame          Notre Dame, Indiana            September 6, 2024     Thank you, Eric, and thank you for t he opportunity to speak to you today.1  My topic is the outlook for the U.S. economy and the implications for monetary policy, a set of judgements that ha ve, of course , been influenced by this morning’s jobs report."
"  But we like to say that monetary policy must be nimble, so that means policymakers must be nimble also."
" In light of  the considerable and ongoing progress toward the Federal Open Market Committee’s 2 percent inflation goal, I believe that the balance of risks has shifted toward the employment side of our dual mandate, and that monetary policy needs to adjust accordingly ."
" The labor market  had been gradual ly moderating for the past year or so, and although inflation rose in the first quarter, it then retreated in the second, and there was a widespread view heading into the second half of the year that the F OMC was on track  to achieve a much desired but unusual  “soft landing.”  Then the July jobs report came in unexpectedly soft ."
" Job creation slowed  and the unemployment rate increased by two tenths  of a percentage point  to 4.3 percent, the highest since October 2021 ."
" There was speculation that weather -related issues might have distorted these results  and, in fact, the unemployment rate ticked down in this  1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee."
" When we faced a period of banking instability in the spring of 2023 , there were calls from some to stop rate hikes despite inflation still running over 5 percent ."
" But t here were other tools in hand to deal with that stress, monetary policy did not overreact, and the FOMC continued tightening policy."
" When inflation fell unexpectedly in the second half of last year, we did not overreact and immediately cu t the policy rate."
" Then when inflation accelerated in the first quarter, we did not overreact and raise rates despite some calls to do so."
  I will be  looking at these last two employment  reports in combination with all other data as we head into the September FOMC meeting to decide the best stance of policy.
"  Today’s job s report  continues the longer -term pattern of a softening of the labor market that is consistent with moderate growth in economic activity, the details of which I will get into in a moment."
" As I said at the outset, c onsidering the progress we have made on getting inflation  back to target , I believe that the balance of risks is now weighted more toward downside risks to the FOMC’s maximum -employment mandate ."
" The collective set of  economic data indicates to me that the labor market and the economy are   - 3 - performing in a solid manner  and the prospects for continued growth and job creation  are good , with inflation near 2 percent."
" In the rest of my remarks, I will lay out my reasons for believing that the economy and employment will likely keep growing as inflation moves toward 2 percent."
 The first of these is the large body of evidence that economic activity is continuing to grow at a solid pace.
 Real gross domestic product (GDP) grew at a 2 .2 percent annual rate in the first half of this year and recent data indicate s that growth is continuing at around this pace in the third quarter.
" As for the labor market, on balance, the data that we have received in the past three days indicates to me that the labor market is continuing to soften but not deteriorat e, and this judgement is important to our upcoming decision on monetary policy."
" Meanwhile, t he four -week moving average of initial claims for   - 4 - unemployment insurance has risen gradually since January but has changed little on net in the past two months , with  initial claims remaining  fairly low."
" After rising to 4.3 percent in July, the unemployment rate ticked  down to 4.2 percent in August."
" Taking a longer perspective , the unemployment rate over the past 16 months has increased gradually but fairly steadily from 3.4  percent  to 4.2 percent  in today’s release ."
"  Accounting for revisions to the jobs numbers that we received in August, t hat level is a bit below what I see as the breakeven pace for job creation that absorbs new entrants to the workforce and keeps the unemployment rate constant.2   July marked the first time that the three -month average unemployment rate ha s increased by at least a half of a percentage point above its 12 -month low, which was 3.6 percent in July 2023."
" As we have seen in the recent past with other supposedly reliable recession rules, such as an  2 The preliminary estimate of the annual benchmark revision to the establishment survey data, which was announced on August 21, suggests that payroll growth between April 2023 and March 2024 will likely be revised down early next year by about 68,000 per month on average."
 The implications for payroll growth beyond March are less clear.
"  Third, recession  rules typically pick up demand -driven recessions ."
 But this is not why unemployment is rising now.
" GDP forecasts for the current quarter all show solid growth, labor market  data show lay off rates are stable , and consumer spending is growing at a healthy rate ."
 These data suggest demand is fairly strong.
" Instead, m ost of the increase in the unemployment rate is from workers entering the labor force and not finding jobs right away."
" So, the recent rise in the unemployment rate appears to b e more of a supply -sidedriven phenomenon, not demand  driven."
" Reliance on old lessons from inverted yield curves to predict a recession, a Phillips curve to predict  3 The 1981 –82 recession was triggered by tight monetary policy in an effort to fight mounting inflation ."
"   - 6 - inflation, or a flat Beveridge curve to predict the movement in the unemployment rate have all led to mistaken economic forecasts."
"  While I don’t see the  recent data pointing to  a recession , I do see some downside risk to employment that I will be watching closely."
" But a t this point, I believe there is substantial evidence that the economy retains the strength and momentum to keep growing , supported by an appropriate loosening of monetary policy ."
 Let me now turn to the outlook for inflation.
" With the labor market cooling, it doesn’t surprise me that wage growth has slowed to a pace consistent with the FOMC’s price -stability goal, and this is supporting ongoing progress toward that objective."
" The employment  cost index  grew at an annualized rate of 3.5 percent  from March to June , and the 12 -month change was 3.9 percent  for private sector  workers , the lowest since late 2021.4  Average hourly earnings, reported in today’s jobs repor t, rose at a three -month annualized pace of 3."
    Inflation in July continued to show progress toward the FOMC’s goal.
" The price index for personal consumption expenditures  (PCE) , the Committee’s preferred inflation measure, increased at a monthly pace of 0.2 percent  in July for both total and core PCE inflation."
" Core PCE inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, is a good guide to underlying inflation, and it increased 2.7 percent over the past 12 months."
 These numbers are good news and  suggest that our restrictive policy stance has put us on the right path to attain our 2  percent  inflation target .
   4 The employment cost index  is a valuable measure of compensation growth because it covers non -wage benefits and accounts for shifts in the shares of workers in different occupations  and industries .
"  - 7 - Looking across the components of inflation, one can see the breadth of the disinflation ."
 Over 50 percent of categories  in the total and core market basket s had annualized monthly inflation less than 2.5 percent in August.
" In fact, the index of core goods price s has reverted to its historical pattern of slight deflation, reflecting normalized  supply after the disruptions of the pandemic as well as ongoing technological and productivity advances."
" Meanwhile, s ervices price inflation has slowed as wage growt h has slowed, since  labor is a large input for much of the service sector."
" Overall, I see significant and ongoing progress toward the FOMC’s inflation goal that I expect  will continue over the remainder of this year."
  Now let me discuss the implications of this outlook for monetary policy.
" As I said at the outset, considering the achieved and continuing progress on inflation and moderation i n the labor market, I believe the time has come to lower the target range for the federal funds rate at our upcoming meeting ."
" With inflation and employment near our long errun goals  and the labor market moderating , it is likely that a series of reductions will be appropriate ."
 I believe there is sufficient room to cut the policy rate and still remain somewhat restrictive to ensure inflation continues on the path to our 2  percent  target.
 This would cause an undesired loosening of monetary policy.
"  If subsequent data show a significant deterioration in the labor market, the FOMC can act quickly and forcefully to adjust monetary policy."
" I was a big advocate of front -loading rate hikes when inflation accelerated in 2022, and I will be an advocate of front -loading rate cuts if that is appropriate."
" While I expect that these cuts will be done  carefully as the economy and employment continue to grow, in the context of stable inflation, I stand ready to act promptly to support the economy as needed."
