"For release on delivery  9:30 a.m. EDT ( 8:30 a.m. local time ) October  11, 2015         U.S. Economy and Monetary Policy     Remarks by   Stanley Fischer   Vice Chair man  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at  Group of Thirty  International Banking Seminar   Lima, Peru         October 11, 2015    The U.S. economy continues to grow at a moderate pace, a pace sufficient to generate ongoing improvements in the labor market."
" On average, payrolls have expanded about 200,000 per month so far this year, and the unemployment rate has declined to 5.1 perce nt, just a bit above Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) p articipants’ median estimate of the normal long -run level of unemployment."
 But there remain additional forms of slack in the labor market that are not fully captured by t he standard unemployment r ate.
" Moreover, nominal wage growth has remained subdued."
" Real wage  growth has also been subdued, possibly reflecting the low rates of productivity growth in the United States economy during recent years."
" While this step -down i s somewhat disappointing, the pace of job growth is still sufficiently strong gradually to erode slack in the labor market, and the prospects for further labor market improvement look good overall."
" G ross domestic product (G DP) growth in the first half of 2 015 is now estimated to have been at an annual rate of 2 -1/4 percent, and private forecasters are projecting GDP to continue to rise, at a pace in the neighborhood of 2 percent, in the second half."
" Further, the negative effect of low oil prices on the growth of investment in the U.S. energy sector appears to be waning."
" The  - 2 - restraint on net exports stemming from the appreciation of the dollar over the past year, and from global developments more generally, may be a negative influence on GDP growth f or somewhat longer, but that restraint is likely to continue to be outweighed by the other sources of growth."
" Although the labor market has been approaching estimates of maximum employment, inflation has been well below the FOMC’s 2 percent objective."
" Inflation has been held down by the declines in crude oil prices over the past year, and the stronger dollar is e xerting downward pressure on U.S. inflation as well."
" Year -overyear changes in headline personal consumption expenditures ( PCE) prices have been running only a little above zero, and core inflation is at about 1 -1/4 percent."
" But for reasons discussed at length in Janet Yellen’s recent speech at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, as long as inflation expectations remain well anchored, inflation is likely to move back toward 2 percent as the transitory effects of oil prices and the dollar fade, and a s the economic expansion continues."
 What about Monetary Policy?
" In support of our dual objectives of maximum employment and price stability, the Federal Reserve has maintained a highly accommodative monetary policy stance since the financial crisis; this  policy has fostered the marked improvement in labor market conditions that we have seen and has helped check undesirable disinflationary pressures."
"  In its statement at the end of the September meeting, the FOMC noted that it anticipates that it will be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate  - 3 - when it has seen some further improvement in the labor market and is reasonably confident that inflation will move back to 2 percent over the medium term."
" Of course, that ass essment was premised on the assumption of continued solid economic growth and further improvement in the labor market, which are key factors supporting our expectation that inflation will rise to our 2 percent objective."
"  A great deal of market attention has focused on the exact timing of our first increase in the funds rate, but what matters for overall financial conditions is expectations for the entire trajectory of short -term interest rates."
" In that regard, most members of the FOMC anticipate that eco nomic conditions are likely to warrant raising short -term interest rates at a gradual pace over the next few years."
" For example, it is conceivable that inflation may rise more slowly or rapidly than we currently anticipate."
 Considerable uncertainties also surround the outlook for economic activity.
" Moreover, net exports hav e served as a significant drag on growth over the past year and recent global economic and financial  - 4 - developments highlight the risk that a slowdown in foreign growth might restrain U.S. economic activity somewhat further."
" The decision was based, in part, on a desire to have more time to appraise recent developments in the global economy, especially th ose originating in the Chinese economy, before beginning the normalization of interest rates."
" That said, recent employment reports have been somewhat disappointing and, as always,  we are closely monitoring developments that could affect our sense of the economic outlook and the risks surrounding that outlook."
" Among these risks is the possibility that shifting expectations concerning U.S. interest rates could lead to more volatility  in financial markets and the value of the dollar, intensifying spillovers to other economies, including emerging market economies."
" We are mindful that this could be the case even though monetary policy normalization in the United States will only occur i n the context of a strengthening U.S. economy, and even  - 5 - though it has been clear from conversations at this conference that many officials of emerging market and other countries feel sufficiently forewarned and prepared for them to want us “to just do it .”  However, we have to remain cognizant of the risks ahead ."
