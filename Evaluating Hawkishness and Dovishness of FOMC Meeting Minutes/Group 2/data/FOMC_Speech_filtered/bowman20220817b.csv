" It is fair to say that the majority of the economic conditions we are experiencing  today, like inflation, are different from those of the last financial crisis."
  This magnified the effect by e liminating jobs in childcare resulting in even more unemployment.
" 4 See Claudia Goldin (2006), “The Quiet Revolution that Transformed Women’s Employment, Education, and Family,” American Economic Review , vol."
"  - 4 - The response to the COVID19 pandemic caused the  most abrupt  decline in employment in the history  of this nation.5  The lockdowns and other government restrictions on business es severely limited  work , education, and travel ."
" Unlike any previous recession, the downturn in employment fell more heavily on women  than men."
 The unemployment rate s for men and women w ere essentially the same before the pandemic but ended up much higher for women.6  That was very different from past recession s.
" For example, after the recession following the housing crisis, unemployment for prime working age men rose to 11 percent, co mpared to only 9 percent for prime age women.7  The women’s labor force participation rate is another way to measur e their presence in the wor kforce."
"  Women have made significant progress in closing the gap with men since the 1960s, including in the five years before the pandemic, but that gap  5 In just two months, the unemployment rate rose from 3.5 percent to 14.7 percent."
" While unemployment was higher during the Great Depression of the 1930s, it never rose this quickly."
  6 Unemployment rose to 16.1 percent for women but only 13.5 percent for men in April 2020.
" F irst, even after the dramatic employment gains over the past  50 years, women are still most often the prima ry caregivers to children  and other family  members."
  Many women with children tend to cycle in and out of employment based on the ir family’s childcare demand s.
" E ach year between May and July, when schools close for the summer , the employment -topopulation ratio for prime age women declines by more than a percentage point  and the n rebounds when s chools reopen in the fall ."
"  9 See Brendan Price  and Melanie Wasserman (2022),  “The Summer Drop in Female Employment ,” CESifo Working Paper 9783 (Munich:  CESifo, June ), https://www.cesifo.org/DocDL/cesifo1_wp9783.pdf ."
" Women with children  saw their labor force participation rate and employmentto-population ratio f all more than for women without children, while men were much less affected  regardless of whether they had children ."
" According to one Federal Reserve study , increased caregiving burdens for mothers with school aged children accounted for about three -fourths of the decline in women in the labor force  from February 2020 to August 2021 but only about one -third of the decline for fathers .11  Even after most children returned to in -person schooling, caregiving continues to weigh on female  participation in the labor force, likely because of  increased care for elderly or ill family members.12 The other major factor affecting women during the pandemic was the  larger number of female employees in high -contact service -sector jobs, where demand dropped sharply during the pandemic and the government -imposed restrictions in response to COVID19."
" Between February and April 2020, service sector employment  fell 40 percent."
" Employment in industries that tend to have larger shares of female workers, such as leisure and hospitality, education, and health services, is still below pre -pandemic levels."
  The shift to remote work may have been a mitigating factor for employment for wom en without college degrees.
" By the end of 2020, unemployment rate s had equalized , and the gap between gender participation rates had returned to pre -pandemic levels in 2021."
" See Claudia Goldin (2022), “Understanding the Economic Impact of COVID -19 on Women.” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, Spring, https://www.brookings.edu/wp -content/uploads/2022/03/SP22_BPEA_Gold in_conf -draft.pdf."
" On the demand side, the labor market continues to be  strong and there are abundant job opportunities for workers of all education and skill  levels ."
"We also don’t know how the influence of inflation will affect decision making about returning to the workforce, but some may feel compelled to return to work."
 Another consideration is caregiving demands and how those responsibilities will be shared  within households .
" R esearch suggests that  assistance programs including job search assistance, training programs, and private -sector employment subsidi es increase the likelihood of employment  by up t o 10 percent for those who utilize the programs .17  The benefits  of this assistance a re not always immediately realized , but women were more likely to benefit from job training and private -sector employment programs."
" In conclusion, although we still have about 4 million people out of the pre -pandemic  workforce, we continue to see strong employment gains and low unemployment rates —the kind of labor market that historically has pulled in more workers ."
" As the service sector continues to recover and as s chools and childcare establishments open more fully , I see potential for greater employment opportunities for women in the future ."
 T oday’s  high inflation and strong employment  will likely create some pressure on labor and employment.
