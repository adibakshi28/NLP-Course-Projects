"For release on delivery  8:30 a.m. E ST Novem ber 27, 2018         Data Dependence and U.S. Monetary Policy     Remarks by  Richard H."
 Today I will discuss  recent economic developments and the economic outlook before going on to outline my thinking about the connections between data dependence and monetary policy.
"monetary policy that flow fro m this perspective.1 Recent Economic Developments and the Economic Outlook  U.S. economic fundamentals are robust, as indicated by strong growth in gross domestic product (GDP) and a job market that has been surprising on the upside for nearly two years."
" S moothing across the first three quarters of this  year, real, or inflation -adjusted, GDP growth is averaging an annual rate of 3.3 percent."
" Private -sector forecasts for the full year-- that is, on a fourthquarter -overfourth- quarter basis --suggest that growth is likely to equal, or perhaps slightly exceed, 3 percent."
" If this occurs, GDP growth in 2018 will be the fastest recorded so far  during the current expansion, which in July entered its 10th year."
" And, at 3.7 percent, the unemployment rate is the lowest it has been since 1969."
" In addition, after remaining stubbornly sluggish throughout much of the expansion, nominal wage growth is picking                                                  1 The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of other Federal Reserve Board members or Federal Open Market Committee participants."
" The inflation data in the year to date for the price index for p ersonal consumption expenditures (PCE) ha ve been running at or close to our 2 percent objective, incl uding on a core basis --that is, excluding volatile food and energy prices."
" While my base case is for this pattern to continue, it is important to monitor measures of inflation expectations to confirm that households and businesses expect price stability t o be maintained."
 The median of expected inflation 5 -to10 years in the future from the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers  is within --but I believe at the lower end  of--the range consistent with price stability.
" Likewise, inflation readings from the TIPS (Treasury Inflation -Protected Securities) market  indicate to me that financial markets expect consumer price index ( CPI) inflation of about 2 percent to be maintained."
" That said, historically , PCE inflation has averaged about 0.3 percent less tha n CPI inflation, and if this were to continue, the readings from the TIPS market would indicate that expected PCE inflation is running at somewhat less than 2 percent."
" What might explain why inflation is running at or close to the Federal Reserve’s longrun objective of 2 percent, and not well above it, when growth is strong and the labor market robust?"
" According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, productivity growth in the business sector, as measured by output per hour, is averaging 2 percent at an annua lized rate this year, while aggregate hours worked in the business sector have risen at an average annual rate of 1."
" This decomposition--in  which the growth in output is broken down into measures of aggregate supply, th e growth of aggregate hours and the growth of output per hour --suggests that the growth rates of  - 3 - productivity and hours worked in 2018 each have been exceeding their respective longer -run rates as estimated by the Congressional Budget Office.2  In other words, while growth in aggregate demand in 2018 has been above the expected long -run growth rate in aggregate supply, it has not been exceeding this year’s growth in actual  aggregate supply."
"Ultimately, hours growth will likely converge to a slower pace  because of demographic factors."
 And recent years’ developments suggest there may still be some further room for participation in the job market --especially in the prime -age group of 25to-54year-olds--to rise.
"As for productivity growth, there is considerable uncertainty about how much of the rebound in productivity growth that we  have seen in recent quarters  is cyclical and how much is structural."
" The structural, or trend, component of productivity growth is a function of capital deepening th rough business investment as well as a multifactor component sometimes referred to as the “Solow  residual.”  Initial estimates fro m the recent GDP release indicate that equipment and software investment in the third quarter moderated from the rapid pace recorded in the                                                  2 See the Congressional Budget Office’s August 2018 projections for the nonfarm business sector at https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2018 -08/51137 -2018 -08potentialgdp.xlsx ."
" One data point does not make a trend, but a n improvement  in business investment will be imp ortant if the pickup in productivity growth that we  have seen in recent quarters  is to be sustained."
"  As for the economic outlook, in the most recent Summary of Economic Projections ( SEP) released in September, participants had a median projection for rea l GDP growth of 3.1 percent in 2018 and 21/2 percent in 2019."
 The unemployment rate was expected to decline to 3 -1/2 percent next year.
" And, for total PCE inflation, the median projection remains near 2  percent."
" With a robust labor market and inflation at or close to our 2 percent inflation goal and based on the baseline economic outlook for 2019 I  have just laid out, I believe monetary policy at this stage of the economic expansion should be aimed at sustaining growth and maximum employment at levels consistent with our inflation objective."
" At this stage of  the interest rate  cycle, I believe it will be especially important to monitor a wide range of data as we continually assess and calibrate whether  the path for the policy rate is consistent with meeti ng our dual -mandate objectives on a sustained basis."
" Data Dependence of Monetary Policy:  What It Means and Why It I s Important  Economic research suggests that monetary policy should be “data dependent.”3 And, indeed, central banks around the world, including the Federal Reserve, often describe their policies in this way."

 - 5 - distinct roles that data dependence should play in the formulation and communication  of monetary policy.
" It is important to state up -front that data dependence is not, in and of itself, a monetary policy strategy ."
" A monetary policy strategy must find a way to combine incoming data and a model of the economy with  a healthy dose of judgment --and humility!-- to formulate , and then communicate, a path for the policy rate most consistent with our policy objectives."
" In the case of the Fed, those  objectives are assigned to us  by the Congress , and they are to achieve maximum employment and price stability."
" U.S. monetary policy has for some time and will, I be lieve, continue to be data dependent in the sense that incoming data reveal at the time of each Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC)  meeting where the economy is at the time of each meeting relative to the goals of                                                  4 For example, long -term bond yields can be written as the sum of the expected path of the policy rate plus a term premium."
 The exchange rate between two co untries can be written as the sum of the policy rate path differential between two countries plus a risk premium.
" So even for households and firms that do  not directly care about the policy rate path, they do care about longterm bond yields and exchange rates that reflect this path."
  - 6 - monetary policy.
 This information on whe re the economy is relative to the goals of monetary policy is an important input in to the policy decision.
" If, for example, incoming data in the months ahead were to reveal that inflation and inflation expectations are running higher than projected at pre sent and in ways that are inconsistent with our 2 percent objective, then I would be receptive to increasing the policy rate by more than I currently expect will be necessary."
 This is indeed the relevant case that the F OMC  and other monetary policym akers face in practice.
" The two most important unknown parameters needed to conduct --and communicate --monetary policy are the rate of unemployment consistent  with maximum employment, u*, and the riskless real rate of interest consistent with price stabili ty, r*."
" As a result, in the real world, monetary policy should, I believe, be data dependent in a second sense:  that incoming data can reveal at each FOMC meeting signals that will enable it to update its estimates of r * and u* in order to obtain its  best estimate of where the economy is heading.6  And , indeed, as indicated by the SEP,                                                  5 See the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2018),  Monetary Policy Report  (Washington:  Board of Governors,  July), pp."
" 3741, https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/20180713_mprfullreport.pdf , or the webpage “Monetary Policy Principles and Practice” available on the Federal Reserve Board’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/monetary -policy -principles -andpractice.htm  for a discussion of the policy rate paths implied  by five different policy rules using  parameter  values  typically assumed in the literature."
" Thus , monetary policy in practice is , of necess ity, as much or more an art than a science."
"  - 7 - FOMC participants ha ve, over the past nearly seven  years, revised their estimates of both u* and r * substantially lower as unemployment fell and real interest rates rem ained well below prior estimates of neutral without the rise in inflation or inflation expectations those earlier estimates would have predicted."
 And these revisions to u* and r * almost  certainly did have an important influence on the path for the policy rate that was actually realized in recent years.7  I would expect to revise my estimates of r * and u* as appropriate if incoming data on future inflation and unemployment diverge materially and persistently from my baseline projections today.
Consequences for Monetary Policy  What does this mean for the conduct of monetary policy?
" Raising rates too quickly could unnecessarily shorten the economic expansion, while moving too slowly could result in rising inflation and inflation expectations down the road that could be costly to reverse , as well as potentially pose financial stability risks."

" This process of learning about r * and u* as new data arrive supports the case for gradual policy normalization, as it will allow the Fed to accumulate more information from the data about the ultimate destination for the policy rate and the unemployment rate at a time when inflation  is close to our 2 percent objective."
