" Our f inancial stability function is supported through appropriate monetary policy, bank supervision and regulation, and by monitoring risks in the U.S. and abroad."
 A stable financial system  provides a solid foundation for a healthy banking system and a growing economy that facilitates maximum employment and stable prices.
" To the contrary, our other statutory authorities —including monetary policy or promoting safety and soundness  in the banking system —can complement or conflict with the goal of promoting financial stability ."
" T his responsibility can be complemented and supported, or in some cases weakened  throug h the execution of the Federal Reserve’s other responsibilities, including monetary policy or the exercise of our emergency authorities."
But it is clear that trends in the interest rate environment whe n the  Federal Open Market Committee’s  (FOMC)  was rapidly tightening policy to combat inflation were an important factor that contributed to S ilicon V alley B ank’s (SVB’s ) failure .
"  To be sure, t he role of monetary policy in the demise of SVB  does not excuse SVB’s management from its inability t o manage the firm’s interest rate risk exposures or excuse the ineffective supervisory response that enabled the buildup of the firm’s excessive risk."
" And  I am not calling into question the FOMC’s monetary policy decisions  from that time , which were appropriately focused on our  congress ionally established mandates  of maximum employment and stable prices."
" As we know, one of the factors that has led to  CRE stress in certain property types, like office, i s the post -pandemic changes in the demand for, and use of, these CRE properties."
" Should this trend continue, we could see decline s in property values, reduced rental income cash flows, or other conditions that could lead to impairment  of some banks’ CRE loans or portfolios, especially if those loans mature and are refinanced at higher interest rates."
" This will be due , in part, to variations in regional return -tooffice patterns, and the shifting  demand for different types of CRE properties."
" Underwriting standards and loanto-value ratios have improved significantly since  the 2008–09 financial crisis , and more recently we have seen credit conditions for CRE lending tighten, even as loan demand weakened."
" The buildup of interest rate risk in the banking system was a known vulnerability and material risk, not just for SVB, but for all financial institutions."
" The responsibility for managing this risk fell on the management team at SVB, just  as it falls on every bank that has material exposure to interest rate risk."
" These events includ ed rapid growth, poor risk management , poor public communication, a lack of supervisory attention to core risks, and an insufficient ly robust supervisory response to the buildup of interest rate and funding risk."
 Last year we saw significant stress in the banking system due to a few bank failures and the persistence of higher inflation and interest rates in the U.S. and in many other countries around the world.
"  First, monetary policy and the fight against inflation."
" When effectively implemented , monetary policy promotes price stability  and maximum employment ."
 It is of utmost importance that we maintain credibility in pursuing our fight against inflation by proceeding carefully and deliberately to achieve our 2 per cent goal .
" C hanges in interest rates can make it more difficult for banks to manage interest rate risk, particularly in the face of rapid rate increases like those from 2022 and 2023."
"   14  See Bowman, “The Path Forward for Bank Capital Reform .”    - 14 -  While monetary policy mandates may support longterm financial stability, monetary policy is an independent function that may heighten short -term stresses in the banking system."
" The rapid increase in deposits in the banking system, and their subsequent drawdown, have pressure tested banks’  abilities to manage funding and interest rate risks, and posed significant challenges for banks faced with few opportunities to put funding to productive use."
