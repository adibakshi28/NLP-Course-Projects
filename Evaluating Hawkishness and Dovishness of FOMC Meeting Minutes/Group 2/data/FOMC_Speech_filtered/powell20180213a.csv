  The Congress has assigned the Federal Reserve the goals of stable prices and maximum employment.
 Price stability means that  businesses and households can make important decisions without concern for high or volatile inflation.
 Maximum employment means that those who want a job either have one or can find one reasonably quickly.
" These are awesome responsibilities, and the Congress has wisely entrusted us with an important degree of independence so that we  can pursue our monetary policy goals without concern for short -term political pressures."
 We will continue to pursue ways to improve transparency both in monetary policy and in regulation.
"   When I joined the Board of Governors in 2012, unemployment was 8.2 percent."
" Since then, monetary policy has continued to support a full recovery in labor markets and a return to our inflation target ; we have made great progress in moving much closer to those  statutory objectives ."
 We are in the process of gradually normalizing both interest rate policy and our balance  - 3 - sheet with a view to extending the recovery and sustaining the pursuit of our objectives.
