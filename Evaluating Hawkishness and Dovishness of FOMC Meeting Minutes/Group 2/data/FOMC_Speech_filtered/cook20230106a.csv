"E ST (10:15 a.m. CST ) January 6, 2023         Thoughts on Inflation in a SupplyConstrained Economy    Remarks by   Lisa D."
 I hope to do that today with my copanelists on a subject that has my and the Federal Open Market Committee’s full attention:  inflation .
" I want to use my time to outline the unique se t of challenges facing policymakers and academics today  as well as how we can better understand inflation dynamics in this new environment , including by looking at novel data sources.1   The effects of the pandemic and Russia’s war against Ukraine have tu rned a  spotlight on the supply side of the economy and its ability to adapt to rapid changes in demand and to navigate a seemingly never -ending sequence of adverse supply shocks."
" The unique nature of the supply and demand imbalances  over the past couple of  years has made it more difficult to forecast inflation , pos ing new  challenges for monetary policy."
" Additionally, we have  some key issues to consi der in approaching  revised models of inflation behavior."
"Before I turn to broader issues with modeling inflation , let me start with the recent inflation data."
" Inflation remains far too high, despite some encouraging signs late ly, and  1 These views are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee ."
"  As a Fed policymaker, I a m committed to bringing inflation back to our 2 percent goal."
 This measure omits volatile food and energy prices and tends to give a more accurate signal of total inflation’s trajectory .
" The high and volatile inflation seen over the past two years appears to reflect rapid shifts in dema nd, coupled with supplychain disruptions."
 This has led to sizable demand–supply imbalances across different sectors.
" To analyze these influences, I find it useful to consider  core inflation in three categories corresponding to distinct components of consumer spending:  core goods inflation, housing services inflation, and inflation in core services other than housing (figure 2)."
" In contrast to core goods inflation, which has declined  over the past year, housing services inflation has continued to rise r apidly, and inflation in other core services has been little changed on balance."
" In the current environment, I find it helpful to examine  a number of somewhat new indicators when assessing inflation pressures within each category."
"    Starting with goods inflation, I have been closely observing indicators of capacity constraints along global and domestic supply chains ."
" The supply of semiconductors has been a particularly strong driver of inflation in the motor vehicle sector and has affe cted that sector’s ability to produce vehicles —a matter I highlighted in a speech  in Detroit in late November.2   In assessing the degree to which shortages of materials and other inputs are constraining goods production, I have been following the Quarterly Survey of Plant Capacity  Utilization , which asks firms whether  production in their plants was below full capacity in a particular quarter and the reasons for any shortfall s (figure 4 )."
"Cook (2022), “The Economic Outlook and U.S. Productivity,” speech delivered at the Detroit Economic Club, Detroit, Michigan, November 30, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20221130a.htm ."
"  - 4 - Turning to housing, a sector in which demand has been quite strong since the onset of the pandemic, the housing services component of core PCE has continued to register rapid increases."
" This pattern may in part reflect the easing of som e special factors that shifted demand during the peak of the pandemic, such as the surge in work from home and the associated increase in demand for bigger homes located in smaller metro areas or further from city centers."
"Because these shifts in demand ha ppened much more rapidly than the response in housing supply, rents increased quite significantly, especially for single -family detached homes."
" Some of this shift in demand may have stabilized over the past year as the pandemic has waned, amenities and cu ltural activities in urban areas have re -opened, and more workers have returned to the office (figure 6)."
" Lastly, inflation in other core services —a large category that covers activities as varied as travel and recreation to medical and legal services —has remained stubbornly  - 5 - high."
" As my colleagues and I have noted in the past, an important source of inflation pressures in this category is the shortage of workers, which has pushed up labor costs at rates above those consistent with 2 percent inflation."
" The inflation outlook for t his non -housing category of core services partly depends on whether growth in nominal labor costs comes back down, and recent data suggest that labor -compensation growth has indeed started to decelerate somewhat over the past year."
" Even as the effects of the pandemic overall appear to be subsiding, the ebbs and flows in the spread of the COVID -19 virus (in addition to other respiratory viruses) continue to add significant volatility to monthly inflation readings in these sectors."
" Crucially, we must be vigilant to ensure that pandemic -era co st pressures and disruptions do not  have lasting effects on inflation."
" If cost shocks and supply disruptions keep inflation elevated for a long enough period, households ’ and firms ’ inflation expectations coul d move higher —a development  that could put additional upward pressure on inflation."
" Accordingly, I look at a variety of  measures of inflation expectations —near - and longterm, as well as survey - and market -based —that cover many different participants in the economy."
" Since the onset of the pandemic, m edians of many surveys of longer -run measures suggest that inflation expectations are still within their pre -pandemic ranges, despite having come up a little ."
" Market -based  measures of inflation compensation beyond  - 6 - the near term, such as those derived from T reasury I nflation -Protected S ecurities , or TIPS, tell a similar story."
 I have also looked beyond the headlines of the survey data to assess how inflation expectations are  moving and responding to the current highinflation environment.
" For example, in the Michigan Surveys  of Consumers, we can compare households’ perceptions of past inflation to their expectations of future inflation at the 1year and 5to-10year horizons  (figure 8)."
" The comparisons show that while households have raised their inflation expectations over the past few years, especially for the shortterm measure, the increases were far less than one -forone with how much they perceived inflation had alread y risen."
" Any deanchoring of expectations would be a major concern, as it could cause the high inflation that we have been experiencing to prove more persistent."
"Looking ahead, the outlook for inflation will depend, in part, on how the factors restraining supply responses and boosting cost pressures in each of these three main PCE price categories play out."
" We should  also advance our understanding of how an environment of more  frequent disruptions to the production and distribution systems will affect potential output, feed into inflation, and become an import ant element in forecasting inflation, assessing risks, and adjusting monetary policy."
  - 7 - We must also continue to advance our understanding of inflation and its underlying structural causal relationships  as well as our ability to forecast risks.
" As sectoral supply –demand imbalances have played a key role in understanding inflation in r ecent years, would adopting a model  with multiple price components  improve our understanding of and ability to forecast overall inflation ?"
" Relatedly, should we look to inflation models with nonlinear or threshold effects, which could capture, among other things, supply constraints ?"
" The pandemic has had a much more prolonged effect on labor supply than many expected, and rapid nominal wage growth has accompanied the recent rise in inflation in ways that traditional measures of labor market tightness —such as the unemployment rate gap —might not be capturing."
" Many analysts have u sed data on job vacancies to go beyond a simple unemployment  rate gap indicator, and I see merit in such approaches."
" We should ask how we can better understand the relation s among realizations of inflation, inflation expectations, and the rate of inflation to which the economy would gravitate after the effects of temporary shocks have ebbed."
" Finally, we should consider if there are ways to better anticipate structural breaks in the inflation process."
" For example, inflation could become  a nonstationary time -series process if inflation expectations were to become de -anchored."
