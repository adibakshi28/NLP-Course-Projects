"For release on delivery  1:00 p.m. EST  February 24, 2021         U.S. Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy     Remarks by   Richard H ."
"Clarida   Vice Chair   Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at the  U.S. Chamber of Commerce   Washington, D.C.  (via webcast)         February 24, 2021   It is my pleasure to meet virtually  with you today .1  I look forward  to our  conversation , but first, please allow  me to offer a few remarks on the economic outlook, the Federal Reserve’s  monetary policy, and our new monetary policy framework ."
" Current Economic Situation  and Outlook  In the second quarter of last year, the COVID -19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic  and the mitigation efforts  put in place to contain it delivered the most severe blow to the U.S. economy since the Great Depression , but e conomic activity rebounded sharply in the third quarter , supported by a robust and unprecedented fiscal and monetary policy response."
" Although more than half of th e 22 million jobs that were lost last spring have been regained , the unemployment rate remained elevated at 6.3 percent in January, and once one factors in the decline in the labor force since the onset of the pandemic and misclassification, the true unemp loyment rate is closer to 10  percent ."
" Core PCE (personal consumption expenditures) inflation is running at just 1.5 percent , and, f or those sectors that have been most adversely affected by the pandemic, price increases remain subdued."
"The housing sector has more than fully recovered from the downturn, supported in part by low mortgage interest rates ."
" And while the economy might not continue to grow at the once -ina-century 33  percent  annualized rate of growth reported in the third quarter of 2020, it is clear that the economy  has turned out to be more resilient in adapting to the virus , and more responsive to monetary and fiscal policy support , than many predicted."
" Indeed, it is worth highlighting that in the baseline projections of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) presented in the latest Summary of Economic Projections , released last December , most of my colleagues and I revised up our outlooks  for the economy over the medium term, projecting a relatively rapid return to levels of employment and inflation consistent  with the Federal Reserve’s statutory mandate as compared with the recovery from the Global Financial Crisis (GFC).2  In particular, the median FOMC participant project ed in December  that by the end of 2023—a little less than three years from now —the unem ployment rate will have fallen below 4  percent, and PCE inflation will have returned to 2  percent."
"  Following the GFC, it took more than eight years for employment and inflation to return to similar mandate -consistent levels."
" As announced in the Septem ber statement and reiterated in the following statements , with inflation running persis tently below 2  percent, our policy will aim to achieve inflation outcomes that keep inflation expectations well anchor ed at our 2 per cent longer -run goal.3  We expect to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomes —as well as our maximum -employment mandate —are achieved."
" We also expect it will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessments of maximum employment , until  inflation has risen to 2 percent , and  until inflation is  on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time."
 - 4 - least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been ma de toward  our maximum -employment and price -stability goals.
"  The changes to the policy statement that we made over the p ast few  FOMC meetings bring our policy guidance in line with the new framework outlined in the  revised Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy that the Committee approved last August.4  In our new framework, we acknowledg e that  policy decisions going forward will be based on the FOMC’s estimates of “ shortfalls  [emphasis added] of employment from its maximum level” —not “deviations .”  This language means that going forward, a low unemployment rate, in and of itself, will not be sufficient to trigger a tightening of monetary policy absent any evidence from other indicators that inflation is at risk of mo ving above mandate -consistent levels."
" With regard to our  price -stability mandate, while the new statement maintains our definition that the longer -run goal for inflation is 2 percent, it elevates the importance—and the challenge —of keeping inflation expec tations well anchored  at 2 percent  in a world  in which an effectivelower -bound constraint is , in downturns, binding on the federal funds rate."
" To this end, the new statement conveys the Committee’s judgment that, in order  to anchor expectations at the 2 percent  level consistent with price stability , it “seeks to achieve inflation that averages 2  percent over time,” and —in the same sentence— that therefore “following periods when inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time.”  As Chair Powell  indicated in his Jackson Hole remarks,  4 The statement is available on the Board’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/review -ofmonetary -policy -strategy -tools -andcommunications -statement -onlonger -rungoals -monetary -policy -strategy.h tm."
"  - 5 - we think of our new framework as an evolution from “flexible inflation targeting” to “flexible average inflation targeting.”5  While this new framework represents a robust evolution in our monetary policy strategy, this strategy is in service to the dual -mandate goals of monetary policy assigned to the Federal Reserve by the Congress —maximum employment and price stability —which remain  unchanged.6 Concluding Remarks While our interest rate and balance sheet tools are providing powerful  support  to the economy and will continue to do so as the recovery progresses, it will take some time for economic activity and employment to return to levels that pre vailed at the business cycle peak reached last February."
