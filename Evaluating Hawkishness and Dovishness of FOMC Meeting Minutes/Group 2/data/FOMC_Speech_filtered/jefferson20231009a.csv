"For release on delivery  1:30 p.m. EDT ( 12:30 p.m. CDT ) October 9 , 2023          U.S. Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy Transmission     Remarks by   Philip N."
" Then, I will turn to the transmission of monetary policy, including some recent evidence on a source of lagged effects of policy."
" Finally, I will discus s considerations for monetary policy that follow from efforts to manage risks given the lagged effects of monetary policy."
 These considerations include the need to proceed carefully as the risks of tightening monetary policy too much relative to those of not tightening enough move closer into balance.
"The I nflation O utlook  Even though recent inflation data have been encouraging, inflation remains too high."
" To better understand core inflation trends, I find it useful to look at three large categories that together make up the core PCE price index, because what has been causing inflation in eac h of these sectors is somewhat different."
" The first category, c ore goods inflation, the red line in figure 2, has slowed strikingly, as supply chain–related  price pressures continue to ease."
" The second category, housing services price inflation, the blac k line, has clearly stepped  - 2 - down, as was anticipated given the previous slowing of increases in rents for new tenants."
" Since this segment accounts for more than 50 percent of the overall core PCE index, we will need to see further slowing in this area to meet our inflation objective."
" The L abor Ma rket Despite the strong September labor market data we received last week, there is evidence that the imbalance between labor demand and labor supply continues to narrow, as labor demand cools while labor supply improves."
" Consistent with cooling labor demand, job openings declined by nearly 1 million from the  end of January  to the end of August ."
" At the same time, layoffs have remained very low, and the pace of payroll employment gains remains  strong, with September nonfarm payroll job gains coming in higher than expecte d."
" In addition, the unemployment rate is 3.8 percent, a level that is still near historical lows."
 The fact that the unemployment rate and layoffs have remained low over the past year amid disinflation suggests that there is a path to restoring price stability without the kind of substantial increase in unemployment that has often accompanied significant tightening cycles.
" Slowing labor demand and improving labor supply have eased pressure in the labor market , and my expectation is for further gradual easing in labor market conditions, as restrictive monetary policy continues to slow labor demand without causing an abrupt increase in layoffs or the unemployment rate."
" Aggregate E conomic A ctivity  Data we have received so far point to solid economic growth in the third quarter, contrary to expectations earlier this year that the economy would slow."
" Housing starts, shown in figure 5, are rebounding after a slowdown that was widely seen as caused by higher interest rates."
" Despite the signs of resilience in the economy this year, some analysts expected slower economic growth this fall, which leads me to the next topic:  What are some near -term risks facing the U.S. economy?"
" Risks Facing the U.S. Economy  So far, the economy has been resilient, and inflation has been  subsiding;  however, I attach a high degree of uncertainty to my outlook and see multiple risks ."
" I am particularly attentive to upside risks to inflation, such as those associated with the economy and labor market remaining too strong to achieve further disinflation, as well as risks associated with unexpected increases in energy prices."
" Since energ y prices are volatile, I tend to look through changes in energy prices and focus more on core inflation in my deliberations."
 I am mindful that persistent inflation above the Federal Open Market Committee’s  (FOMC ) 2 percent target increases the risk that i nflationary  - 4 - expectations become unanchored.
" Thus, regardless of its source, my objective  is to return inflation to the  FOMC’s 2 percent target ."
" I just mentioned upside risks  to inflation, but there are also important downside risks to economic activity , such as the slowdown in foreign economic growth."
" China’s economy appears to have lost momentum as real estate activity has fallen, and other indicators, including retail sales, also suggest softness in economic activity."
" On the Transmissio n of Monetary Policy  As you know, m onetary policy is transmitted to the rest of the economy by affecting broad financial conditions, including market interest rates."
" Higher market rates raise the interest rates that households and businesses face and reduce the spending they undertake —most notably, spending on business fixed investment, residential construction, and consumer durables."
 Higher interest rates also affect asset prices.
" For example, higher interest rates, all else being equal, raise the exchange value of the dollar, which then boosts imports and reduces exports."
" Additionally, higher interest rates, along with a higher anticipated path of policy, lead investors to discount cash flows associated with longer -term investments at higher rates."
" In addition, monetary policy affects risk premiums.1  Tighter  1 Bernanke and Kuttner  (2005), Hanson and Stein (2015), and Gertler and Karadi (2015), among others, highlight that monetary policy affects risk premiums."
" If policy tightens in response to inflationary shocks, term premiums also tend to rise as longer - - 5 - monetary policy tends to reduce the willingness of investors to bear risk, increasing yield spreads and reducing the prices for a range of asset classes and augmenting the direct effects on interest rates and asset prices described earlier."
  Figure 6 illu strates how longterm interest rates move in anticipation of changes in the federal funds rate.
" In a speech last spring, I noted that we are still learning about the full effect of our policy tig htening in this post -pandemic cycle.2  Thus, I am also mindful of factors that could attenuate or delay the transmission of monetary policy."
 One such factor is that the bulk of corporate debt issued by large firms has not yet had to be refinanced since t he FOMC started to tighten monetary policy in March 2022.
" As most nonfinanc ial corporate debt is in the form of corporate bonds that were issued before 2022, the interest rate averaged across all outstanding corporate debt is still low, as shown in figure 7."
" Given that this additional tightening is in train, it may be too soon to say confidently that we’ve tightened enough to return inflation to our 2 percent target."
 This leads me to my next topic:  considerations for monetary policy that follow from my economic outlook and risks to it that I have already mentioned.
" Monetary Policy Considerations  After increasing the target range for  the federal funds rate by 525 basis points since early 2022, my view is that the FOMC  is in a position to proceed carefully in assessing the extent of a ny additional policy firming that may be necessary ."
" In part, the upward movement in real yields may reflect investors’ assessment that the underlying momentum of the economy is stronger than previously recognized and, as a result, a restrictive stance of monetary policy may be needed for longer than previously thought in order to return inflation to 2 percent."
