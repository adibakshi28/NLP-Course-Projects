" These are:  (1) The impact of the Great Recession and the associated Global F inancial Crisis on the growth of output , both in the short term and over the longer term."
" (3) The impact of the crisis on the conduct of monetary policy --in particular, how to balanc e the goals of  achiev ing stable inflation  and full employment  while also taking into account the need to maintain financial  stability."
   - 2 - Challenges Arising from the Growth Slowdown   I begin by reviewing recent global economic developmen ts and the questions they raise about where we are likely to go from here.
" There has been a steady, if unspectacular, climb in global growth  since the financial crisis."
" For example, b ased on recent IMF data from the World Economic Outlook , which uses purchasing power parity weights, world growth average d 3 percent during the first four years of the recovery  and as of July was expected to be 3.4 percent this year.2  The IMF expects global growth to reach 4 percent next year --a rate about equal to its es timate for longrun growth."
 This global average reflects a forecast of steady improvement in the performance of output in the advanced economies where growth averaged less than 1  percent during the initial phase of the recovery to an expected 2 -1/2 percen t by 2015.
" With few exceptions, growth in the advanced economies has underperformed expectations of growth as economies exited from recession."
 Year after year we have had to explain from midyear on why the global growth rate has been lower than predicted as little as two quarters back.
"  - 3 - recoveries in the advanced economies have been well below average.3  In the emerging market economies, the initial recovery was  more  in line with historical experience , but recently the pace of growth has  been disappointing in those econom ies as well."
" These disappointments  in output performance have not only led to repeated downward revisions of forecasts for short -term growth,  but also to a general re assessment of longer -run growth."
" From the perspective of the FOMC, even in the heart of the crisis, in January 2009, the central tendency of the Committee  members ’ projections for longer -run U.S. growth was between 2 -1/2 and 3 percent."
" Indeed, the IMF’s expectation for longrun global growth is now a full percentage point below what it was immediately before the G lobal Financial Crisis .4  This re consideration  reflects lower projected growth for both the advanced and the emerging market economies."
" This pattern of disap pointment and downward revision  sets up the first , and the basic,  challenge on the list of issues policymakers face in moving ahead : restoring growth, if that is possible."
4 This calculation compares the IMF WEO’s forecast for global growth 5 years ahead from the April 2008 WEO to the WEO July 2014 forecast.
   - 4 - prolonged hit to output growth following the global financial crisis.
" But i t is also possible that  the underperformance reflects a more structural , longer -term,  shift in the global economy , with less growth in underlying supply factors ."
"  The difficulty in disentangling demand and supply factors makes the job of the monetary policymaker especially hard since it complicates the assessment of  the amount of slack , or underutilized productive capacity , in the economy."
" Over the longer term it will be possible to disentangle the amount of slack on the basis of the behavior of prices and wages as the levels of resource utilization in economies rise, but it would be better to understand why growth has been so slow without experiencing either a runup in inflation or a descent into deflation."
"  In the United States , three major aggregate demand headwinds appear to have kept a more vig orous recovery from taking hold ."

"  - 5 - sector  during the recove ry period , the significant drag --now waning --from fiscal policy, and the negative impact from the growth slowdown abroad --particularly in Europe --are all prominent factors that have constrained the pace of economic activity ."
" Moreover , the wealth effect from the decline in housing prices, as well as  the inability of many underwater households to take advantage of low interest rates to refinance their mortgages , may have reduced household demand for non -housing goods and services."
"   Indeed, some researchers have argued that the failure to deal decisi vely with the housing problem seriously prolonged and deepened the crisis.6  Growth in o ther countries  that experienced financial crises , including the United Kingdom , Ireland,  and Spain, ha s been weigh ted down by struggling residential sectors."
" More rece ntly, many of these factors have abated in the United States and yet, a fter e ncouraging signs of improvement  in 2012 and in early 2013 , over the past year  the growth of  residential construction  has faltered and home sales have fallen off."
  The sharp rise i n mortgage interest rates in mid -2013 likely contributed to this setback.
 The stance of U.S. fiscal policy in recent years constituted a significant drag on growth  as the large budget deficit was reduced .
"  - 6 - automatic stabilizers, such as decline s in tax revenues and increase s in unemployment benefits , that tend to accompany a downturn in activity."
"  In addition, discretionary fisc al policy actions typically boost  growth in the years just after a recession."
" In the United States , at the federal level, the end of the payroll tax cut, the sequestration, the squeeze on discretionary spending from budget caps,  and the declines in defense spending have all curtailed  economic growth ."
" Last year, for example , the Congressional Budget Office estimated that fiscal headwinds slowed the pace of real GDP growth in 2013 by about 1 -1/2 percentage points relative to what it would have been otherwise."
" Job cuts at federal, st ate, and local governments have reduced payrolls by almost 3/4 of a million workers, resulting in a decline in  total government civilian employment of 31/4 percent since its peak in early 2009.7  The fiscal adjust ments of the last few years have reduced the federal government deficit to an expected level of 3 percent of GDP in 2014 and fiscal drag over the next few years is likely to  be relatively low."
" A third headwind slowing the U.S. recovery has been  unex pectedly  slow global growth , which reduced export demand ."
" Over the past several years, a number of our key                                                  7 None of this is to deny that it was necessary to reduce the large fiscal deficits in many countries that resulted from the combined effects of the recession and of expansionary fiscal policies at the early stages of the crisis; it simply reaffirms that th e short -run impacts of contractionary fiscal policies are contractionary."
" Some have been relatively short lived, including the collapse in Japanese growth following the trag ic earthquake in 2011 ."
" Others look to be more structural, such as the stepdown in Chinese growth compared to its double digit precrisis pace."
"  The housing market, fiscal consolidation, and unexpectedly anemic foreign demand all play a significant role in explaining the weakness of aggregate demand in the U.S. economy, weakness that could not have been accurately predicted based on past recession experiences or by the fact that this recession started with a massive financial crisis."
" But, turning to the aggregate supply side, we are also seeing impor tant signs of a slowdown of growth in  the productive capacity of the economy --in the growth in labor supply , capital investment, and productivity ."
 This may well reflect factors related to or predating the recession that are also holding down growth .
 The  considerable slowdown in the growth rate of labor supply observed over the past decade  is a source of concern for the prospects of U.S. output  growth .
 Another factor that may be contributing to a slowdown in longer -run output growth is a decline in the rate of investment.
" However, in the United States , and in many other countries as well, the growth rate of the capital stock has yet to bounce back appreciably --despite h istorically low interest rates, access to borrowing for most firms, and ample profits and cash --causing concerns over the long -run prospects for the recovery of investment ."
"Turning next to productivity growth, Solow’s famous result over fifty years ago was that over eighty percent of growth  in output per hour  in the period 19 091949 came from technical change.8  Between 1964 and 2003 total factor  productivity growth in the United States averaged around 1 -1/2 percent , contributing to a 2 percent expansion per                                                  8 Robert M."
" However, productivity growth in recent years ha s been disappointing."
" Over the past decade, U.S. total factor  productivity growth declined  to 1 percen t, which some argue may represent the real norm for the U.S. economy.9  In this view, the long period of rapid productivity growth spurred by  the technological innovations of the first and second Industrial Revolutions  ended in the 1970s  and the economy ha s continued at a lower productivity growth rate since then , except for a brief burst in the mid1990s ."
" In particular, these authors argue that the information technology (IT) revolution of the past several decades --including the diffusion of computers, th e development of the internet, and improvements in telecommunications —was an anomaly and is unlikely to generate the productivity gains prompted by earlier innovations such as electrification and mass production."
" Obviously, future productivity growth in th e United States and in the world is yet to be determined."
 Possibly we are moving into a period of slower productivity growth --but I for one continue to be amazed at the potential for improving the quality of the lives of most people in the world that the IT explosion has already revealed.

"  That leaves aside the question of the capacity for effective macroprudential supervision, an issue we will take up as we begin  to discuss the optimal conduct of monetary policy in the wake of the crisis, given the heightened attention of monetary policy makers to the importance of maintaining financial stability."
"     - 15 - Issues Facing Monetary Policymakers  in the Wake  of the Crisis  and Recession  Prior to the global financial crisis, a rough consensus  had emerged among academics and monetary policymakers that best -practice for monetary policy was flexible inflation targeting."
" In the U .S., flexible inflation targeting is implied by the du al mandate given to the Fed, under which monetary policy is required to take into account deviations of both output and inflation from their target levels."
" But even in countries where the central bank officially targets only inflation, monetary policymake rs in practice also aim to stabilize the real economy around some normal level or path."
" With short -term interest rates near zero, many central banks considerably expanded their balance sheets, for instance through large -scale purchases of assets or significant liquidity injections ."
 They also engaged in forward guidance to put downward pressure on interest rates and support aggregate demand.
 But the use of these tools --particularly as reflected in the size of centra l bank balance sheets --will make  the conduct of monetary policy more complicated during the recovery.
 Raising the rate of inte rest paid on excess reserves should play a central role in the eventual normalization of short -term interest rates.
  Another important question is whether monetary policymakers should alter their basic framework of flexible inflation targeting to take financial stabilit y into account .
" My answer to that question is that the “flexible” part of flexible inflation targeting should include contributing to financial stability, provided that it aids in the attainment of the main goals of monetary policy."
" The main goal s in the United States are those of the dual mandate, maximum employment and stable prices; in other countries the main goal is stable prices or low inflation."
" If no such tools are available in the economy, the central bank may have to  consider whether to use monetary policy --that is , the interest rate --to deal with the threat of financial instability."
" At the moment in the U.S., though there may be some areas of concern, I do  not think that financial stability concerns warrant deviatin g from our traditional focus on inflation and employment."
"  A decision on whether to use the interest rate to deal with the threat of financial instability is always likely to be difficult --particularly in a small open economy, where raising the interest r ate is likely to produce an unwanted exchange rate appreciation."
" Starting in 2010, th e Bank of Israel adopted several macroprudential measures to address rapidly rising house prices,  including higher  capital requirements and provisioning against mortgages; limits to the share of any housing financing package indexed to the short -term (central bank) interest rate to one -third of the total loan, with the remainder of the package having to be linked to either the five -year real or five -year nominal interest rate; and, on different  occasions, limits to the loan -tovalue (LTV) and payment -toincome (PTI) ratios."
" And, while there may arise situations where monetary policy needs to be used to deal with potential financial instability , I believe that macroprudential policies will become an important complement to our traditional tools."
" In addition to the difficulties of assessing the relative importance of cyclical  (short -term) versus structural (long -term) factors   - 19 - affecting the global economy , and in thinking about how to return to high er output and productivity growth, policymakers  are focusing on the uses of monetary policy in attaining the dual goals of maximum employment and stable prices and in maintaining financial stability ."
"  At the same time, and although I earlier foreswore discussion of fiscal policy, it is clear that fiscal policies can be used both to increase growth a nd to deal with potential problems of financial stability."
