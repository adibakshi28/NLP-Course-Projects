 How the Fed Makes Monetary Policy  Let me begin with  how we make monetary policy at the Fed.
 Our monetary policy commi ttee--the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC )--meets eight times a year at the Federal Reserve Board in Washington  to make decisions about whether to change the short -term policy rate and other aspects of monetary policy.2  Sitting around the massive conf erence table will be the policymakers of the Fed --the members of the Board of Governors and the 12 Reserve Bank presidents.
"  Written materials are distributed to all FOMC participants in advance of the meeting.4  The most extensive of these materials is called the Tealbook, a two -part document prepared by the Board’s staff and distributed to Board members and Reserve Bank presidents.5 The first part of the Tealbook contains a summary and analysis of recent economic and financial developments in the United St ates and foreign economies, the                                                  2 For example, the FOMC has disc ussed unconventional monetary policies (large -scale asset purchases and forward guidance), its plans for the withdrawal of monetary policy accommodation and reducing the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet (termed “normalization”), and the operatio nal framework used to implement monetary policy."
"  In addition to this baseline judgmental forecast, the staff provides model -based simulations of a number of alternative scenarios or risks --for instance, if the pri ce of oil were to be lower, the U.S. dollar stronger, or wage growth higher than envisioned in the baseline projection."
" Four times a year, b efore the March, June, September, and December  FOMC meetings, Board members and Reserve B ank presidents submit their own projections for real gross domestic product (GDP ) growth, the unemployment rate, inflation, and the Committee’s polic y rate target, the federal funds rate."
" These forecasts are released to the  - 4 - public shortly after the FOMC meeting in the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), and they receive a good deal of scrutiny by financial market participants and journalists.6 One important but underappreciated aspect of the SEP is that its projections are based on each individual’s  assessment of appropriate monetary policy."
 They do not write down what they expect the Committee to do.7  Yet the public often misinterprets the interest rate paths we write down as a projection of the Committee’s policy path or a commitment to a particular path.
" Models and the Modeling of Monetary Policy  Now , that is a lot of talk about the process of monetary policymaking."
" The Board staff maintains several m odels; I  will focus on the FRB/US model, the best known and most                                                  6 The SEP was introduced in 2007 and expanded on forecasts that FOMC participants had already been making twice each year since 1979 in the Monetary Policy Report  prepared for the Congress."
 7 “Appropriate monetary policy” is Fedspeak for a policy that delivers on the Committee’s interpretation of its legislated mandate.
 The fact that FOMC participants’ forecasts a re conditional on each participant’s conception of the appropriate monetary policy has at least three noteworthy implications.
" First, it means that their forecasts will tend to converge over time to the Committee’s 2  percent inflation objective and to each individual’s interpretation of maximum employmen t."
" First, for models to be of use to guide monetary policy, they need to be estimated such that they do a reasonable job of fitting the data; only under such circumstances can their quantitative predictions be taken as useful.10  Of co urse, they do not fit the data perfectly."
 The monetary policy transmission mechanism i s the means through which changes in a central bank’s  policy instrument affect the economy.
" In the FRB/US model, the usual  policy instrument --the federal funds rate --plays no direct  role in the economy.12  Rather, an increase in the federal funds rate affects expectations of future values of  that rate, which in turn affect interest rates on longer -term bonds, equity prices, and the exchange value of the U.S. dollar.13  Households and firms are forward  looking in that the adjustment costs just mentioned oblige households to set out a plan--a contingency plan --for consumption, savings, and employment for the future."
" Increases in interest rates influence these plans, as they do the investment and hiring plans of firms."
" All of those  decisions, in  turn, shape  employment,  output , and inflation ."
"                                                 12 In this speech, I do  not talk about the effects of  socalled u nconventional monetary policies --balance sheet policies, forward guidance, and the like --except to note that many of the same elements of the monetary policy transmission mechanism are in force when the central bank uses such policies; in particular, expec tations formation continues to play a key role."
"  - 7 - So the expectations of decisionmakers, be they households, firms, or investors , are at the center of how monetary policy work s--both in the real world and in FRB/US ."
" The role of monetary policymakers is to respond to economic shocks in as efficient a manner as possible, and thereby influence economic outcomes and expectations, in order to achieve the central bank’s assigned goals."
" Indeed, the conduct of monetary policy is often described as a matter of expectations management.14 How might policymakers best respond to economic  disturbances and influence expectations  in order to achieve their policy objectives ?"
" To help FOMC policymakers answer that question, the Tealbook for each meeting provides monetary policy prescriptions from a variety of simple policy rules, including Joh n Taylor’s famous rule  (or family of rules) .15  Economic c onditions  and the outlook  change from meeting to meeting , and, not surprisingly, the prescriptions of simple policy rules  change with them."
" The reason I focus on a meeting so long ago is that materials from FOMC meetings in 2011 --including the transcripts and Tealbooks --have recently been released to the public , follo wing the usual five -year lag .16 At the time  of the April 2011 meeting, the federal funds rate had been near zero for almost 2 -1/2 years; moreover, the FOMC had been indicating in its post -meeting                                                  14 Bernanke (2007) discusses the role the central bank plays in managing inflation expectations."
" - 8 - statement s that it expected to k eep the funds rate target at exceptionally low levels “for an extended period.”  Figure 2 reproduces panel s from the  April 2011  Tealbook that show  the staff’s baseline forecast --the solid black line --as well as prescriptions from three simple policy rules that were generated using the FRB/US model.17  The panel on the left shows the paths for the federal funds rate, while the panels on the right show the implications of those policy prescriptions for the unemployment rate and core PCE (personal consumption expenditures) price inflation, respectively.18 Each of the rules is regarded as mainstream ."
" Note that there are substantial differences in the prescribed policy paths, both in terms of how long the interest rate remains near zero as well as how gradual or rapid is the pace of tightening  once the interest rate begins to increase."
" Those differences produce different outcomes for unemployment and inflation, as can be seen in the two panels on  the right of figure 2 ."
" The Taylor  (1993) rule is ** 0.5 ( ) 0.5 R r y         , where R  is the nominal federal funds rate ; *r is the  equilibrium real interest rate ;  is the four -quarter PCE price inflation rate ; *  is the inflation  objective, 2 percent ; and y  is the output gap, defined as the percentage difference between actual GDP and potential  GDP ."
" 18 In the end, the unem ployment rate and inflation did not turn out to be greatly different from what is shown in figure 2, although the shocks borne by the economy required a more accommodative stance of policy to bring about tho se outcomes."
"  For an explanation of how the FOMC interprets its statutory goals, see the Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy,” which the Committee first issued in January 2012 and reaffirms each year."
" Correspondingly, in the panels to the right of figure 2, the unemployment rate is higher  on the broken green line  than on the other  paths  for unemployment  that are associated with lower interest rates ."
 And you  can figure out why the broken green line for core PCE inflation is lower than for the other paths in the panel on the right -hand side of figure 2.
 How does the FOMC choose its interest rate decision?
" One Monetary Policy Decision:  August 2011  As an example of such a  process , I want to discuss the important decision taken at the August 2011 meeting."
" And although the economy had improved from the depths of the Great Recession, the unemployment rate was still above 9 percent."
" Figure 3, taken from the August 2011 Tealbook, illustrates how the change in the economic outlook affected FRB/US simulations of optimal monetary policy .19  As you know, an optimal policy is a path for the policy instrument that minimizes the shortfalls in economic                                                  19 I rely on optimal policy simulations here because the August 2011 Tealbook did not include a figure like that shown in figure 2."
"  - 10 - outcomes relative to policymakers’ goals; in this case, the optimal policy path i s computed using the FRB/US model and takes the staff’s baseline outlook as given.20  In princip le, optimal policy simulations deliver better outcomes than simple policy rules, but those outcomes are condition al on some strong assumptions.21 The black line in figure 3 shows  the optimal policy path in the August 2011 Tealbook conditional on interest rates being constrained to remain above zero."
" Thus, the prescriptions  of optimal policy were saying not only that the Committee’s interest rate should remain at zero for some time to come , but also that that period of time should be consid erably  longer than previously thought ."
" Some of them judged that additional stimulus  was called for  because they thought the ec onomy would  not get back                                                  20 More formally, o ptimal policies  are the solution to an optimal control problem in which  a search procedure is used to solve for the path of the federal funds rate that minimizes the value of an assumed loss function, conditional on a baseline outlook and on allowing for feedback of differences  in the federal funds rate from its baseline to real activity and inflation."
  - 11 - to full employment without it .22  These policymakers a rgued that a strengthening  of the language in the Committee’s post -meeting statement about how long they expected the federal funds rate to remain exceptionally low  would be appropriate .
" They judged that this response would influence expectations and thus longer -term interest rates,  and would help the public understand the Committee’s intentions .23 The change that was proposed, and eventually adopted, replaced the ph rase that characterized how long the Committee expected the federal funds rate would remain low--“for an extended period” --with “at leas t through mid -2013.”  As shown in figure 4, this subtle but important change in language in the FOMC’s post -meeting stat ement induced a decline in interest rates acro ss the term structure ."
"                                                  22 At the time of the August meeting, t otal PCE price inflation on a 12 -month basis was running above the Committee’s 2 percent objective, boosted by transitory factors that were expected to dissipate; the staff forecast was for inflation to slow to 1.5 percent in 2012."
" However, a  few other policymakers  preferred to leave the statement unchang ed, citing a variety of reasons, including that weakness in the real economy largely reflected nonmonetary factors ; that the economic situation had improved since the Committee had undertaken its second large -scale asset purchase program in November 2010, and no additional monetary accommodation was appropriate ; and that the reference to 2013 might be misinterpreted a s suggesting that monetary policy was no longer contingent on ho w the economic outlook evolved."
 The interest rate decision taken i n August 2011 was u nusual in that a decision was made about the likely path of future interest rates.
" Most often, the FOMC is deciding what interest rate to set at its current meeting."
" A monetary rule, or a model simulation, or both, will likel y be part of the economic case supporting a monetary policy decision, but they are rarely the full justification for the decision."
 Sometimes a monetary policy committee will make a decision that is not consistent with the prescriptions of standard monetar y rules --and that may well be the right decision.
" Further, i n modern times, the policy statement of the monetary policy committee will seek to explain why the c ommittee is making the decision it is announcing."
