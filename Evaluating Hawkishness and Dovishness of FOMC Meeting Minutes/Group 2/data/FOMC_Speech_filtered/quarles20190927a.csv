" But both law and economics are also centrally concerned with systems, the performance and relationships of broad aggregates of laws or economic activity."
" And, under this theory, one outcome of this system —higher corporate profit margins —would likely give firms greater scope to increase wages wit hout increasing prices, thus offering a potential explanation for the flattening of the Phillips curve, the traditional macroeconomic relationship between the unemployment rate and inflation."
" For a policymaker who  accepted this theory, his comfort in maintaining a very low rate of unemployment could depend significantly on his understanding of that underlying legal system and his estimation of how its evolution would likely proceed in the future."
" The debate  around those laws, in the 1930s, was not an academic one, because t he pain and suffering of that era was evident —at the time Congress was debating the Banking Act of 1935, which established the modern framework for the federal bank regulation and supervision, the unemployment rate in the United States was  still 20 percent .1  I will leave to others the question of whether every detail of the laws passed in this period was equally effective, in the short or long term, in promoting mac roeconomic stabili ty."
" Such analysis, including conventional –costbenefit  analysis, traditionally  did not take macroeconomic variables like  gross  - 7 - domestic product  (GDP ) growth or the unemployment rate ."
" In the CCAR process, the Federal Reserve simulates macroeconomic scenarios like a recession in which GDP falls and the unemployment rate rises significantly."
" In the 2019 stress test cycle, for example, we tested banks against  a hypothetical  global recession  in which the unemployment rate in the United States rose to 10 percent.4  The stressed banks were required to show that they could continue to meet minimum  capital requirements  in the face of those hypothetical macroeconomic shocks."
" Specifically, t hese models assume that higher capital requirements would reduce the probability of a financial crisis occurrin g but would increase the cost of bank lending, thereby lowering GDP growth."
" There was no change to the E uropean C entral B ank’s monetary policy mandate , but it received direct supervisory authority over some of the Eurozone’s largest banks through the Single Supervisory Mechanism and also  continue s to monitor financial sector risks."
