" And, as in any field, the people who make up the profession lie at the heart of its  growth and progress."
"In keeping with that spirit of inquiry, I would like to talk today about some of the open questions I see for understanding  the economic outlook and for setting monetary policy."
"   - 2 - Inflation  For monetary policy, the foremost questions currently are about the inflation process."
"  The pandemic -related economic shutdown created rapid shifts in demand, which continued through the reopening process and reflected people’s wants and needs during that time."
" Russia’s invasion of Ukraine last year further restricted access to commodities, and the subsequent surge in energy prices drove a spike in consumer price inflation to a peak in mid -2022, reaching levels not seen since the 1980s."
" As energy prices have moderated and supply disruptions have eas ed, inflation has followed suit and started to abate."
" Last week, data on the consumer price index (CPI) showed 12 -month inflation falling  to 5 percent in March from a peak of about 9  percent last June."
" Last week’s data suggest that PCE inflation likely will be somewhat above 4 percent in March, also significantly lower than last June."
" The big question,  however, is whether, and how quickly, inflation will continue its downward path toward our target of 2 percent."
" Much of the decline so far has been driven by the moderation in energy prices, and there is evidence that the path back to our low and stable inflation goal could be long and is  likely to be uneven and bumpy."
" Total (or headline) inflation tells us something critical about the effect  on our daily lives —simply put , people  need to eat, pay their bills, and get to work and school,   - 3 - among other things , and their budgets feel the impact."
"  We also look at core inflation, which omits volatile food and energy prices and tends to give a more accurate signal of total inflation ’s trajectory."
  The rise and fall in core measures has been less dramatic than that of total inflation.
" We also look at other measures of underlying inflation, that try to get at the central tendency of inflation, such as median or trimmed -mean inflation."
" All of these measures have come off their peaks but remain elevated, suggesting t hat inflation has become broad  based in the economy."
 One question is whether timely data can give us a sense of where inflation is going.
" For instance, t o forecast core goods prices —which drove much of the initial surge in inflation —I look at various measures of supply chain disruptions and input prices."
 A big contributor to inflation over the past two years has been housing services prices (rent and a measure called owners’ equivalent rent —essentially what a homeow ner would pay if they had to rent their home).
 One encouraging development is that last   - 4 - week’s CPI data showed a significant slowing in housing services inflation.
 This development likely reflects moderation in demand and has been helped by the add itional  supply of multifamily housing that is being completed.
" Finally, in forecasting inflation, especially for the broader category of core services ex."
"housing, a looming questi on is how the relationship between inflation and measures of economic slack —including  in the labor market —will play out."
" This relationship has been challenged in recent years , particularly in terms of trying to explain the large movements in inflation sin ce the pandemic."
" Payroll employment growth was robust in the first three months of this year, unemployment is near record lows, and job openings remain very high."
" The African American unemployment rate historically has been about 4 to 5 perce ntage points above the overall unemployment rate, but that gap was cut in about half in 2019, following years of sustained expansion."
"  Similarly, w orkers in the lowest -income quartile have seen the strongest wage growth  relative to other quartiles  over the past two years ."
 Wage growth has moderated somewhat from the rates reached ab out a year ago.
" That could be significant, as much of the surge in wage growth a year ago may have been driven by outsized wage gains of those changing jobs and by employers raising wages to retain existing workers."
 One factor is that new estimates show higher population growth over the past year amid a rebound in immigration  from its reduced levels during  the pandemic.
" One important source of increased supply is productivity growth, which comes through both capital investment and innovation."
 My hope is that we will see increased innovation and productivity associated with the spurt of new businesses that have opened sin ce the onset of the pandemic.
"  Supply -side issues , especially innovation and productivity , have been a theme of my own academic research , including papers on patents and on the growth and funding of small businesses."
" Monetary Policy  Stepping back into the United States in 2023, what does the state of the economy mean for monetary policy?"
 And what are the lags before the full effects are felt on the economy and on inflation?
" This data -dependent, risk -management framework has led me to support the F OMC ’s response of rapid  monetary  policy tightening —we have raised int erest rates 475 basis points in a year to bring inflation under control."
"  Currently, with the federal funds rate target near 5 percent, I am looking at what rate will be sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to 2  percent, over time."
" But if data show continued strength in the economy and slower disinflation, we may have more work to do."
" In setting monetary policy, I continue to be guided by  our d ualmandate goals of maximum employment and price stability."
" I, like my colleagues on the FOMC,  am committed  to bring ing inflation back to its 2 percent target over time, which will lay the foundation for sustainable strength in the labor market and the U .S."
