" For example, from my experience living in rural Kansas , I understand how smaller communities with a less diversified housing and employment base can take a long time to recover from a fall in home prices ."
" Second , and related to one of the Federal Reserveâ€™s  monetary policy goals,  rising  home prices  and rents raise the cost of housing."
" Because housing costs are a large share of living expenses for most people, these increases are adding to current inflationary pressures in the economy."
"  In addition, there are signs of underlying supply and demand imbalances that will contribute to increases in housing costs and inflation."
" But it has  - 4 - become increasingly clear that the low supply of homes , in combination with a strong demand for housing,  is an important part of the story."
" These issues affect the rental market too :  The multifamily rental market is at historic levels of tightnes s, with over 95  percent occupancy in major markets.4  I anticipate that these housing supply issues are unlikely to reverse materially in the short term, which suggest s that we are likely to see higher inflation from housing for a while."
"  Mortgage refinancing surged because of the drop in longterm interest rates, and nonbank servicers use d the proceeds from thes e refinacings to fund the advances associated with forbearance."
