"For release on delivery  12:15 p.m. E DT  October 17, 2016        Why Are Interest Rates So Low?"
" My subject is the historically low level of interest rates , a topic not far from the minds of many in this audience and of many others in the United States and all over the world.1   Notwithstanding the increase in the federal funds rate last December, the federal funds rate remains at a very low level."
" Longterm interest rates in many countries are also remarkably low, suggesting that participants in financial markets expect policy  rates to remain  depressed for years to come."
 My main objective today will be to present a quantitative assessment of some possible factors behind low  interest rates --and also of factors that could contribute to higher interest rates  in the future .
"Now, I am sure that th e reaction of many of you may be, “Well, if you and your Fed colleagues dis like low interest rates, why not just go ahead and raise them?"
" You are  the Federal Reserve, after all.”  One of my goals today is to convince you that it is  not that simple, and th at changes in factors over which the Federal Reserve has little influence --such as technological innovation and demographics --are important factors contributing to both short - and long -term interest rates being so low at present."
   There are at least three reasons why we should be concerned about such low interest rates .
" First, and most worrying , is the possibility that low long -term interest rates are a signal that the economy’s long -run growth prospects are dim."
  - 2 - more detail on the link between economic growth and interest rates.
 One theme that will emerge is that depressed long -term growth prospects put sustained downward pressure on interest rates.
" To the extent that low long -term interest rates tell us th at the outlook for economic growth is poor, all of us should be very concerned, for --as we all know --economic growth lies at the heart of our nation’s, and the world’s, future prosperity."
 That is the problem of what used to be called the zero lower bound on interest rates.
" In light  of several countries currently operating with negative interest rates, we now refer not to the zero  lower bound, but to the effective lower bound , a number that is close to zero but negative."
" Operating close to the effective lower bound limits the room for central banks to combat recessions using their conventional interest rate tool --that is, by cutting the policy interest rate ."
 The limitation on monetary policy imposed by low trend interest rates could therefore lead to longer and deeper recession s when the economy is  hit by negative shocks .
And the third concern is  that low interest rates may also threaten financial stability as some investors reach for yield and  compressed net interest margins make it harder for some  financial institutions to build up capital buffers .
" I should say that while this is a reason for concern and bears continual monitoring, the evidence so far  does not suggest a heightened threat of financial instability  in the post -financial -crisis United States stemming from ultralow interest rates ."
    Those are three powerful reasons to prefer interest rates that are higher than current rates .
" But, of course , Fed interest rates are kept very low at the moment because of the need to maintain aggregate demand at levels that will support the attainment of our dual policy goals of maximum sustainable employment and price stability, defined as the  rate of inflation in  the price level of p ersonal  consumption expenditures  (or PCE) being at our target  level of 2 percent."
" That the actual f ederal  funds rate has to be so low for the Fed to meet its objectives suggests that the equilibrium interest rate --that is, the federal funds rate that will prevail in the longer run, once cyclical and other transitory factors have played out --has fallen.2  Let me turn now to my main focus, namely an assessment of why the equilibrium interest rate is so low."
" To frame this discussion, it  is useful to think about the real interest rate as the price that equilibrates the economy’s supply of saving with the economy’s  demand for investment."
" To explain why interest rates are low, we look for factors that are boosting saving , depressing investment , or both.3  For those of you lucky enough to remember the economics you learned  many  years ago, we are looking at a point that is on the IS curve --                                                 2 More formally, my Federal Reserve colleagues Thomas Laubach and John Williams (2003) have developed a statistical procedure that decomposes the movement in interest rates into the contribution of longrun and short -run factors ."
" 3 While the analysis that follows relates to interest rates in the lo ng run, these factors are also important determinants of interest rates in the short run."
" And beca use we are considering the long -run equilibrium  interest rate, we are looking at the interest rate that equilibrates investment and saving when the economy is at full employment, as it is assumed to be in the long run."
  The economy’s growth prospects  must be at the top of the list.
" A mong the factors affecting economic growth, gains in productivity and growth of  the labor force are particularly important."
" Third, investment has been weak in recent years, especially given the low levels of interest rates."
" Fourth and f inally , developments  abroad , notably a slowing in the trend pace  of foreign economic growth, may be affecting U.S.  interest rates."
"  To assess the empirical importance of these factors in explaining low long -run equilibrium interest rates, I will rely heavily on simulations that the Board of Governors ’ staff have run with one of our main econometric models, the FRB/US model."
"   Going through the four major forces I just mentioned, I will look first at the effect that slower trend economic g rowth , both on account of the decline in productivity growth as well as lower labor force growth, may be having on interest rates."
" Starting with  - 5 - productivity, gains in labor productivity have been meager  in recent years."
" By contrast, over the 30 years from 1976 to 2005, productivity rose a bit more than 2 percent per year."
" Although the jury is still out on what is behind the latest slowdown in productivity gains, prominent scholars such as Robert Gordon and John Fernald suggest  that smaller incre ases in productivity are the result of a slowdown in innovation that is likely to persist for some time.4     Lower long -run trend productivity growth, and thus lower trend output growth, affects the balance between saving and investment through a variety of channels."
" A slower pace of innovation means  that there will be fewer profitable opportunities in which to invest , which will tend to push down investment  demand ."
" Lower productivity growth also reduces the future income prospects of households, lowerin g their consumption spending  today and boosting their demand for  savings."
" Thus, slower  productivity  growth implies both lower investment and higher savings, both of which tend to push down interest rates.5                                                   4 See Gordon (2016) and Fernald and Wang (2015)."
 The empirical evidence on the link between trend growth and long -run equilibrium interest rates is mixed.
"(2016) conclude that while “the theoretical presumption that there is a link between aggregate growth and real rates is very strong ,” the empirical link between the real equilibrium interest rate and real GDP growth is weak."
"there a great deal of uncertainty over the relationship between growth and interest rates, likely, in p art because of  the multitude of shocks to which the economy is subject ."
" A structural model, such as FRB/US, provides on e method of estimating the link between growth and interest rates by examining the reaction of the interest rate to a clearly defined shock to the trend growth rate."
"       - 6 - In addition to a  slower  pace of  innovation, it i s also likely that demographic changes will weigh on U.S. economic growth in the years ahead, as they have in the recent past ."
" According to some estimates, the effects of this p opulation aging will trim about 1/4 percentage point from labor  force growth in coming years .6   Lower tren d increases in productivity and  slower labor  force growth impl y lower overall economic growth in the years ahead."
" T his view is consistent with the most recent Summary of Economic Projections of the FOMC, in which the median value for the rate of growth in real gross domestic product ( GDP ) in the longer run is just 13/4 percent, compared with an average growth rate from 1990 to 2005 of around 3 perce nt.7 We can use simulations of the FRB/US model to infer the consequences of such a slowdown in longer -run GDP  growth for the equilibrium federal funds rate."
" In addition to its effects on labor  force growth, the aging of the population is likely to boost aggregate household saving."
"  - 7 - economists suggests that population aging --through its effects on saving --could be pushing down the longer -run equilibrium fe deral funds rate relative to its level in the 1980s by as much as 75 basis points .10  In addition to s lower growth and demographic changes, a third factor that may be pushing down interest rates in the United States is weak investment."
" A nalysis with the FRB/US model suggests that, given how low interest rates have been in recent years, investment should have been considerably higher  in the past couple of  years ."
  Another possibility is that the economy is simply less capital intensive than it was in earlier decades.11        Fourth on my list are developments abroad:  Many of the facto rs depressing U.S. interest rates have also been working to lower foreign interest rates.
" To take just one example, many advanced foreign economies face a slowdown in longer -term growth prospects that is similar to that in the United States, with similar implications for equilibrium interest rates in the longer run."
" In the FRB/US model, lower interest rates abroad put upward pressure on the foreign exchange value of the dollar and thus lower net exports."
 FRB/US simulations suggest that a reduction in the  equilibrium federal funds rate of about 30 basis points would be required to offset the effects in the United States of a reduction in foreign growth prospects similar to w hat we have seen in the United States.
 T hat is because the broad factors we  are considering here could well overlap --particularly the link between slower growth and the remaining three factors .
" Still, the comparison gives us a notion of the relative importance of some of the leading explanations for the decline in interest rates."
"  I started by noting the costs of low interest rates, including the limits on the ability of monetary  policy to respond to recessions, and possible risks to financial stability."
" Now that we have some notion of where lower interest rates might be coming from, I want to turn to the question of what might contribute to raising longer -run equilibrium  interes t rates.12   One development that would boost the equilibrium interest rate would be a further waning in the investor precaution that seems to have been holding back investment --in Keynesian terms, an improvement in animal spirits ."
" In addition, higher investment would improve the longer -run growth prospects of the U.S. economy , although the effects in this particular case are fairly small, with real GDP growth about 0.1 percentage point higher on account of the higher investment."
"                                                   12 By emphasizing “longer -run equilibrium” interest rates, I am excluding monetary policy (which is unlikely to have major effects on the equilibrium real interest rate), and thereby also relating to concerns about monetary policy being the only game in town."
"  - 9 - Over the years, many economists --some of them textbook authors --have noted that expansionary fiscal policy could raise equilibrium interest rates .13  To illustrate this possibility, t he next  two bars on the slide show  the estimated  effect on interest rates  of two possible expansionary fiscal  policies , one that boosts government spending by 1 percent of GDP and another that cuts taxes by a similar amount."
 H igher spending  of this amount  would raise  equilibrium interest rates by about 50 ba sis points ; lower taxes would raise equilibrium rates by 40 basis points.
  Government policies that boost the economy’s long -run growth rate would be an even better means of raising the equilibrium interest rate.
"  - 10 - would be, some combination of more encouragement for private investment,  improved public infrastructure, better education, and more  effective regulation is  likely to promot e faster growth of productivity and living standards --and also to reduce  the probability that the economy and, particularly , the central bank will in the future have to contend with the effective lower bound."
" In summary, a variety of factors have been holding down interest rates and may continue to do so for some time."
 But economic policy can help offset the forces driving down longer -run equilibrium interest rates.
 Some of these policies may also help boost the economy’s growth potential.

 Background Our point of departure is a definition of the equilibrium interest rate that corresponds with the neutral rate of interest.
" In particular, we use the definition of the neutral rate of interest that Chair Yellen used in a 2015 speech:  “the real rate consistent with the economy achieving maximum employment and price stability over the medium term,” which , in an elaboration in a footnote , is said to be  “usually thought of as independent of the cyclical disturbances that routinely buffet the economy  ."
"[and have] slow -moving influences on both aggregate demand and supply .”2  This definition corresponds reasonably closely with the (possibly time -varying) intercept of a Taylor -type rule in t hat the standard arguments of the                                                  1 See Yellen (2015a), paragraph 15 and footnote 4."
"  Other definitions of the neutral rate used by the Chair in her public communications include the short -term real interest rate “that would be neither expansionary nor contractionary if the economy was operating near potential” (Yellen, 2015 c, 2016) and the short -term real interest rate “t hat would be consistent with real GDP expanding in line with potential” (Yellen, 2015b)."
"  - 2 - Taylor  (1999) rule --the output gap and the deviation of inflation from target --can be thought of as capturing the influence of the drivers of monetary policy at business cycle frequencies, with the longer -lasting (lower -frequency) determinants of the level of the policy rate being subsumed into movements in r *.3 Using this definition of r *, we identify several  economic disturbances that have longlasting consequences for the savings -investment balance of the U.S. economy."
" We assume that the public views the Taylor (1999) rule as a good approximation of the conduct of monetary policy , and , accordingly , they price assets and formulate expenditure decisions on the expectation that this policy will prevail."
" The  shocks  All s imulations were carried out using the database from the public release of the FRB/US model, starting in  2036:Q1, at which time the economy is in steady state.4                                                   3 Williams (201 6) defi nes the natural rate of interest  as the short -term real rate “that balances monetary policy so that it is neither accommodative nor contractionary in terms of growth and inflation.”  This description is clo se to that of the neutral rate (but not the natura l rate) in the main text  and in note 2  but adds a reference to inflation, which does not appear in definitions of the neutral rate."
"  - 3 - Accordingly, t he effective lower bound on nominal interest rates is never a binding constraint under these circumstances."
" Consistent with the definition of a steady state, at the start of the simulations, the  output gap is closed, the unemployment rate is equal to its natural rate of 4.8 percent , inflation is 2 percent, the nominal federal funds rate is 3 percent, the 10 -year Treasury bond rate is 3.5 percent, and potential output growth is 2 percent."
" In all instances, monetary policy is assumed to be governed by the (noninertial) Taylor (1999) rule, with  an intercept shift where applicable."
" The growth rate of the U.S. population ( variable N16 in the FRB/US model ) is assumed to climb over the course of a year to a pace that is 1 percentage point faster than in the baseline, with commensurate effects on the labor force, employment, potential output , and actual output."
 The elevated pace of population growth last s for 20 years befo re returning to baseline rates over the succeeding 5 years.
 Productivity .
" The growth rate of total factor productivity (HMFPT) is increased 0.7 percentage point , which implies an acceleration in labor productivity (output per worker hour) of 1.0 percentag e point."
 Foreign interest rates.
 The equilibrium real interest rate in (trade -weighted) foreign economies (FRSTAR) is assumed to decline by 1 percentage point for an indefinite period.
 This decline has the effect of reducing both foreign longand short -term interest rates by a comparable amount.
" The federal personal income tax rate is  held at baseline for 10 years , and  - 5 - then the model’s fiscal policy reaction function is allowed to adjust the tax rate so as to return the ratio of fede ral deficits to GDP to its previous target level."
" A sequence of shocks to the FRB/US model’s equation for the average federal personal income tax rate (TRFP) is constructed such that the resulting decrease in taxes increases the federal budget deficit very similarly to the g overnment spending shock describe d previously , in order to make the two simulations of comparable magnitude."
" After 10 years, the personal federal tax rate is  allowed to adjust to bring the ratio of government deficits to GDP back to the baseline target le vel."

 Calculations  for f igure s Figure  1:  Effects on the longrun e quilibrium federal funds r ate Slower growth.
 The slower growth of 11/4 percentage point s in this scenario assumes that labor force growth is 1/4 percentage point lower and that labor productivity growth is 1  percentage point lower .
" According to t able A .1, an increase of  1 percentage point in labor  force growth would raise the equilibrium real federal funds rate by 1.15 percentage points."
" The contribution of the slower labor  force growth to the equilibrium federal funds rate is therefore negative 0.25 x 1.15, or negative 30 basis points ."
" Similarly,  the contribution of slower productivity growth i s negative 1.00 x 0.85 = negative 85 basis points, for a total effect of negative 115 basis points."
" However, this number includes the effects of demographics on the labor force , which ha ve already been included in the growth effect."
" As suggested by figure  12 of Gagnon, Johannsen, and Lopez -Salido (2016) , adjusting for the effects of employment would trim about 50 basis points from the total effect (the distance between the solid -blue and dashed -green lines as of 2015)."
" Thus, in Gagnon , Johannsen, and Lopez -Salido (2016), the  effects excluding those via labor  force growth are about negative 75  basis points."
Slower foreign growth.
" Here, we assume that foreign trend GDP growth has fallen as much as U.S. trend GDP growth and thus has had a  similar effect on interest rates --namely, 115 basis points."
