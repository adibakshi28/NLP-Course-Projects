" In pursuit of that overarching objective, t he Congress has assigned us the goal s of achieving maximum employment and stable prices, known as the dual mandate ."
" Today I will review recent economic developments , focusing on the labor market and inflation, and  then touch briefly on longer -term growth prospects ."
 I will finish with a disc ussion of monetary policy.
"    Recent Developments and the State of the Economy  After what at times has been a slow recovery from the financial crisis and the Great Recession, growth has picked up."
" Unemployment has fallen from 10 percent at its peak in Oc tober 2009 to 4.1 percent, the lowest level in nearly two decades (figure 1)."
" Seventeen million jobs have been created in this expansion, and the monthly pace of job growth remains more than sufficient to employ  new entrants to the labor force (figure 2)."
 Inflation has continued to run below the FOMC’s 2 percent objective but we expect it to move up in coming months and to stabilize around 2 percent over the medium term.
" Fiscal stimulus and continued accommodative financial conditions  are supporting both household spending and business investment, while strong global growth has boosted U.S. exports."
"As many of you know, each quarter FOMC participants --the members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Reserve Bank s--submit  their individual projections for growth, unemployment, and inflation, as well as their forecasts of the appropriate path of the federal funds rate, which the Committee uses as the primary tool of monetary policy."
" As you can see, participants g enerally raised their forecasts for growth in inflation -adjusted gross domestic product  (GDP) and lowered their forecasts for unemployment."
" In addition, many participants expressed  increased confidence that inflation would move up toward our 2 percent target."
"  The State of the Labor Market  As I mentioned, the headline unemployment rate has declined to levels not seen since 2000."
" The median projection in the March SEP calls for unemployment to fall well below 4 percent  for a sustained period, something that has not happened since the late 1960s."
" This strong labor market forecast has important implications for the fulfillment of both side s of the dual mandate , and thus for the path of monetary policy ."
 So I will spend a few minutes exploring the state of the job market in some detail.
"      - 3 - A good place to begin is with the term “maximum employment,”  which the Committee takes to mean the highest utilization  of labor resource s that is sustainable over time."
"  In the long run, t he level of m aximum employment is not determined by monetary policy, but rather by factors affecting the structure and dynamics of the labor market.1  Also, the level of maximum employment is not directly measureable, and it changes over time."
" Real -time estimates of maximum employment are highly uncertain.2  Recognizing this uncertainty, the FOMC does not set a fixed goal for maximum employment."
" Instead, we look at  a wide range of indicators  to assess how close the economy is to maximum employment."
  The headline unemployment rate is arguably the best single indicator of labor market conditions .
" As I noted, the unemployment rate is currently at 4.1 percent, which is a bit below the FOMC’s median estimate of the longer -run normal rate of unemployment."
" H owever, the unemployment rate does not paint a complete picture."
" For example, to be counted in the official measure as unemployed, a person must have actively looked for a job in the past four weeks.3  People who have not looked for work as recently are counted not as unemployed, but as out of the labor force , even though some of them  actually want a job                                                  1 See t he FOMC’s Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, amended effective January 30 , 2018, available on the Board’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_LongerRunGoals.pdf ."
"2 This fundamental uncertainty has been extensively studied, particularly with respect to the most commonly used measure of full employment --the so -called natural rate o f unemployment."
" The authors of one well -regarded study concluded that even when using sophisticated statistical techniques, the natural rate of unemployment could be as much as 1 -1/2 percentage points above or below their point estimate."
"Watson (1997), “How Precise Are Estimates of the Natural Rate of Unemployment?” chapter 5 in Christina D."
"Romer, eds., Reducing Inflation:  Motivation and Strategy  (Chicago:  University of Chicago Press),  pp."
 And still others who say that they do not want a job right now might be pulled into the job market if the right opportunity came along.
" So, in judging tightness in the labor market, we also look at a range of other statistics, including alternative measures of unemployment, as well as measures of vacancies and job flows, survey s of households ’ and businesses’ perceptions of the job market, and, of course, data on wages and prices."
"  Figure 3 shows the headline unemployment rate and two  broader measures of unemployment, known as U -5 and U -6.4  U5 includes the unemployed plus peo ple who say they want a job and  have looked for one in the past year  (though not in the past four weeks )."
" Like the headline unemployment rate, both U -5 and U -6 have declined significantly in recent years."
" They are now at  levels seen before the financial crisis, though not quite as low as they w ere in 199 9 to 2000, a period of very tight job market conditions."
" In addition, the proportion of workers quitting their jobs is high, suggesting that workers are being hired away from their current employers and that                                                  4 The o fficial unemployment rate  is known as U -3."
" Indeed, the strong job market does appear to be drawing back some people who have been out of the labor force for a significant time."
" For example, the percentage of adults returning to the labor force  after previously reporting that they were n ot working because of a disability  has increased over the past couple of years, and anecdotal reports indicate that employers are increasingly willing to take on and train workers they would not have considered in the past.6   Wage growth has also remained  moderate, though it has picked up compared with its pace in the early part of this recovery (figure 8)."
 Weak productivity growth is an important reason why we have not seen larger wage gains in recent years.
 I will be looking for an additional pickup in wage growth as the labor market strengthens further.
"                                                  6 For disability transition rates, see Ernie Tedeschi (2018) , “Will Employment Keep Growing?"
"  - 6 -  Taking all of these measures of labor utilization on board, what can we say ab out the state of the labor market relative to our statutory goal of maximum employment?"
"  While uncertainty around the long run level of these indicators is substantial, m any of them suggest  a labor market that is in the neighborhood of  maximum employment."
" Assessments of the maximum level of employment are uncertain, however, and subject to revision."
   Inflation  That brings me to inflation --the other leg of our dual mandate.
 T he substantial  improvement in the labor market  has been accompanied by low inflation.
" Indeed, inflation has continued to run below our 2 percent longer -run objective (figure 9)."
" The core price index, which excl udes the prices of energy and food and is typically a better indicator of future inflation, rose 1.6 percent over the same period."
" This persistent shortf all in inflation from our target has led some to question the traditional relationship between inflation and the unemployment rate, also known as the Phillips c urve."
" Given how low the unemployment rate is, why aren’t we seeing higher inflation now?"
 As th ose of you who carefully read the minutes of each FOMC meeting are aware-- and I know there are some of you out there --we had a thorough discussion of inflation dynamics at our January meeting.
 Almost all of the participants in that  - 7 - discussion thought that  the Phillips c urve remained a useful basis for understanding inflation.
" T hey also acknowledged, however, that the link between labor market tightness and changes in inflation has become weaker and more difficult to estimate, reflecting in part the extend ed period of low and stable inflation in the United States and in other advanced economies."
" Participants also noted that other factors, including inflation expectations and transitory changes in energy and import prices, can affect inflation."
  My view is that the data continue to show a relationship between the overall state of the labor market and the change in inflation  over time .
" That connection has weakened over the past couple of decades, but it still persists, and I believe it continues to be meanin gful for monetary policy."
 Much of the shortfall in inflation in recent years is well explained by high unemployment during the early years of the recovery and by falling energy prices and the rise in the dollar in 2015 and 2016.
" But the decline in inflation last year, as labor market conditions improved significantly, was  a bit of a surprise."
" In fact, monthly inflation readings have been firmer  over the past several months, and the 12month change should move up notably this spring as last spring’s soft readings drop out of the 12month calculation."
" Consistent with this view, the me dian of FOMC participants’ projections in our March survey shows inflation moving up to 1.9 percent this year and to 2 percent in 2019."
" Longer -Run Challenges   - 8 - Although job creation is strong and unemployment is low, the U.S. economy continues to face some important longer -run challenges."
" GDP growth has averaged just over 2 percent per year in the current economic expansion, much slower than in previous expansio ns."
 Even the higher growth seen in recent quarters remains below the trend before the crisis.
" Nonetheless , the unemployment rate has come down 6 percentage points  during the current expansion, suggest ing that the trend growth necessary to keep the unempl oyment rate unchanged has shifted down materially."
 The median of FOMC participants’ projections  of this longer -run trend growth rate is  1.8 percent.
" The latest estimate from the Blue -Chip consensus of private forecasters is about 2 percent .7 To unpack this discussion a little further, we can think of output growth as composed of increases in hours worked and in output per hour, also known as productivity growth."
" O utput growth in that ear lier expansion averaged nearly 3 percent per year, well above the pace in the current expansion."
" Despite the faster output growth, however, average job growth in the early 2000s was 1/2 percentage point per year weaker than in the current expansion."
" The difference, of course, is productivity, which grew at more than twice the pace in the early 2000s than it has in recent years."
" Taking a longer view, t he average pace of labor productivity growth since 2010 is the slowest since World War II and about one -fourth  of the  average postwar rate (figure 10)."
" Moreover, the productivity growth slowdown seems to be global and is evident even in countries that were little affected by  the financial crisis (figure 11 )."
" - 9 -  As shown in figure 12, labor productivity growth can be broken down into the contributions from business investment (or capital deepening), changes in the skills and work experience  of the workforce, and a residual component that is attributed to other factors such as technological change and  efficiency gains (usually lumped together under the term total factor or multifactor productivity)."
"  In the United States and in many other countries, some of the slowdown in labor productivity growth can be traced to weak investment after the crisis."
 The other big contributor to the slowdown has been in total factor productivity growth.
 The outlook for this dimension of productivity is considerably more uncertain.
" Total factor  productivity growth is notoriously difficult to predict, and there are sharply different views on where it might be heading."
" Some argue that the productivity gains from the information technology revolution are largely behind us , and that more -recent technological innovations have less potential to boost productivity.8  Others argue that a well -documented decline in measures of business dynamism --such as the number of start -ups, the closure of less -productive businesses, and the rates at which workers qui t their jobs and move around the country to take a new job--has held back productivity growth, in part by slowing the movement of capital and labor to ward their most productive uses .9                                                  8 See, for example, Robert J."
"Gordon (2016), The Rise and Fall of American Growth:  The U.S. Standard of Living since the Civil War  (Princeton, N.J.:  Princeton University Press) ."
" - 10 - New technological breakthroughs in many areas --robotics, biotech, and ar tificial intelligence to name just a few --have led others to take a more optimistic view.10  They point to  substantial productivity gains from innovation in areas such as  energy production and e -commerce ."
" In addition, the optimists point out that advances in technology often take decades to work their way into the economy before their ultimate effects on productivity  are felt ."
" That delay has been observed even for gamechanging in novations  like the steam engine and electrification , which ultimately produce d broad increases in productivity and living standards."
 Only time will tell who has the better view --the record provides little basis to believe that we can accurately forecast the rate of increase in productivity.
   The other principal contributor to output growth is hours worked.
" Hours growth, in turn, is largely determined by growth in the labor force, which has averaged just 1/2 percent per year since 2010,  well below the average in previous decades (figure 13 )."
" One reason for slower growth of the labor force is that baby boomers are aging and retiring , and that trend will continue."

" - 12 - To summarize this discussion, some of the factors weighing on longer -term growth are likely to be persistent, particularly the slowing in growth of the workforce."
" We can put policies in place that will support labor force participation and give us the best chance to achieve broad and sustained increases in productivity, and thus in living standards."
      Monetary Policy  Let me turn now to monetary policy.
" In the aftermath of the financial crisis, the FOMC went to extraordinary lengths to promote the recovery, support job growth, and prevent inflation from falling too low."
" A s the recovery advanced, it became appropriate to begin reducing  monetary policy support."
" Since monetary policy affects the economy with a lag, waiting until inflation and employment hit our goals before reducing policy support could have led to a rise in inflation to unwelcome levels."
" In such circum stances, monetary policy might need to tighten abruptly, which could disrupt the economy or even trigger a recession."
" As a result, to sustain the expansion, the FOMC adopted a gradual approach to reducing monetary policy support."
" Since then, with the economy improving but inflation still below target and some slack remaining, the Committee has continued to gradually raise interest rates."
 Reducing our securities holdings is another way to move the stance of monetary policy toward neutral.
 This decision marked another step in the ongoing process of gradually scaling back monetary policy accommodation.
" Over the next few years, we will continue to aim for 2 percent inflation and for a sustained economic expansion with a strong labor market."
" It remains the case that raising rates too slowly wou ld make it necessary for  monetary policy to tighten abruptly down the road, which c ould jeopardize the economic expansion."
 But raising rates too quickly would increase the risk that inflation would remain persistently below our 2 percent objective.
"   - 14 - Of course, our views about appropriate monetary policy in the months and years ahead will be informed by incoming economic data and the evolving outlook."
" If the outlook changes, so too will monetary policy."
 Our overarching objective will remain th e same:  fostering a strong economy for all Americans --one that provides plentiful jobs and low and stable inflation.
