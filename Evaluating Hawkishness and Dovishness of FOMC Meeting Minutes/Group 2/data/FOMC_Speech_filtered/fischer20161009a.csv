"EDT  October 9, 2016         The U.S. Economy and Monetary Policy     Remarks by   Stanley Fischer   Vice Chair man  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at the   31st Annual Group of Thirty International Banking Seminar   Washington, D .C."
"       October 9, 2016    With Friday morning’s labor market data prominently in the news, I  will start with the labor market and end with a discussion of monetary policy .1   Recent reports pertaining to the labor market , including Friday’s release, have been solid, showing continued improvement."
" Despite the strong job growth, the unemployment rate, at 5 percent in September , has essentially moved sideways this year as individuals have come back into the labor market in response to be tter employment opportunities and higher wages."
"  All told , with the unemployment rate not far from levels that most Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) participants view as normal in the longer run and the rise in the participation rate, I see the U.S. economy as close to full employment, with some further impr ovement  expected."
 This pace likely underestimates the momentum in aggregate demand because it includes a sizable inventory correction that began early last year.
"  - 2 - to demand over the second half of the year and for GDP t o increase in the neighborhood of 23/4 percent.2   Household spending has been the main contributor to real GDP growth  over the past four quarters , and , with solid gains in employment and household income and upbeat consumer sentiment , this sector should continue to support growth over the second half of the year."
" In contrast, residential construction has cooled this year despite rising home prices and low interest rates."
" Perhaps investment is being held down as firms respond to the flat trajectories for m anufacturing and  exports, reflecting subdued foreign demand and the appreciation  of the dollar  since mid -2014."
 Another possibility could be that firms are reassessing the prospects for growth and profitability in an environment of weak productivity growth and are accordingly scaling back investment plans.
" Notwithstanding these downside  possibilities, I expect that business investment will pick up in the second half of the year as the drag from the oil sector wanes and as firms expand capacity to meet rising demand."
 - 3 - The combination of strong job gains and lackluster GDP growth over  the past four quarters reflects exceptionally poor labor productivity growth.
" Indeed, productivity declined 1/2 percent over the most recent four quarters and has increased only about 1/4 percent per year, on average, since 2011."
" While improving labor market conditions have led to higher household incomes in recent years, the key to improved living standards  over the long haul will be a revival in productivity growth-- at least to more normal levels, possibly in the range of 11/2 percent per annum."
" T he economic effects of the steep appre ciation of the dollar that began in mid -2014 have begun to fade, and U.S. exports have returned to growth following a weak  2015."
"   Turning to inflation, I believe that transitory effects of the fall in oil prices and the rise in the dollar a re the primary  reason that inflation has fallen short of the FOMC’s  2 percent goal."
" Total personal consumption expenditures ( PCE) inflation was 1 percent in August on a 12month basis, held down by earlier declines in gasoline prices, but c ore PCE inflation  has moved up somewhat , and its 12month change stood at 1."
" As oil prices and the dollar  stabilize, the drag on consumer price inflation from these sources ought to dissipate , and inflation will likely move  closer to 2 percent."
"  This projection, however, depends critically on expectations for future inflation remaining reasonably well anchored ; as the FOMC has noted, low readings for some indicators of expected inflation deserve close watching."
   - 4 - Let me now turn to the monetary policy outlook.
" As we noted in the statement, the recent pickup in economic growth and continued progress in the labor market have strengthened the case for an increase in the federal funds rate.3  Indeed, in our individual economic projections prepared in advance of the September meeting, nearly all FOMC participants anticipated  an increase in the target range for the federal funds rate by the end of this year."
" Moreover, as economic growth has picked up and some of the earlier concerns about the global outlook have receded, the Committee judged the risks to the U.S. economic out look to be roughly balanced."
" And while inflation remains low, we expect it to rise to our 2 percent objective over time."
" But with labor market slack being taken up at a somewhat slower pace than in previous years, scope for some further improvement in the labor market remaining, and inflation continuing to run below  our 2 percent target, we chose to wait for further evidence of conti nued progress toward our objectives."
" That assessment is  based on our view that the neutral nominal federal funds rate --that is, the interest rate that is neither expansionary nor contractionary and keeps the economy operating on an even keel --is currently  low by historical standards."
" With the federal funds ra te modestly below the neutral rate, the current stance of monetary policy should be viewed as modestly accommodative, which is appropriate to foster further progress toward our objectives."
" But since monetary policy is only modestly accommodative, there appears little risk of falling behind the curve in the near future, and gradual increases in the federal funds rate will likely be sufficient to get monetary policy to a neutral  stance over the next few years."
" This view is consistent with the projections of  appropriate monetary policy prepared by FOMC participants in connection with our September  meeting.4  The median projection for the federal funds rate rises only gradually to 1.1 percent at the end of next year, 1.9 percent at the end of 2018, and 2.6 per cent by the end of 2019."
