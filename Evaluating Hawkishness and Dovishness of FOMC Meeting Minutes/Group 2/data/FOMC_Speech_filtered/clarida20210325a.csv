"For release on delivery  10:10 a.m. EDT  March  25, 20 21         U.S. Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy     Remarks by   Richard H ."
"  I look forward , as always , to a conversation with my good friend and one -time colleague Tim  Adams , but first, please allow  me to offer a few remarks on the economic outlook, Federal Reserve monetary policy, and our new monetary policy framework ."
" Gross domestic product  (GDP ) collapsed at a roughly 31.5 percent annual rate in the second quarter of 2020, more than 22 million jo bs were lost  in March and April , and the unemployment rate rose from a 50year low of 3.5 percent  in February to almost 15  percent in April."
" As shown in the latest Summary of Economic Projections  (SEP) , the median of Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC)  participants ’ projections for 2021 GDP growth is 6.5 percent.2  If these projections are realized, GDP will grow at the  1 The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of other Federal Res erve Board members or Federal Open Market Committee participants."
"economic activity  are realized, rising  U.S. imports will serve as an important source of external demand to the rest of the world thi s year and beyond."
"   As with overall economic activity, conditions in the labor market have recently improved ."
" Employment rose by 379,000 in February, as the leisure and hospitality sector recouped about twothirds of the jobs that were lost  in December and January."
" Nonethe less, employment is still 9.5 million below its pre -pandemic level  for the economy as a whole ."
" The unemployment rate remains elevated at 6.2 percent in February, and once one factors in the decline in the labor force since the onset of the pandemic and the misclassification  of some workers on temporary layoff as employed , the true unemployment rate is closer to 10 percent ."
" It is worth highlighting that in the ba seline projections of the FOMC presented in the latest SEP released last week,  my colleagues and I substantially revised up our outlook for the economy, projecting a relatively rapid return to levels of employment and inflation consistent with the Federal Reserve’s statutory mandate as compared with the recovery from the Global Financial Crisis."
" In particular, the median FOMC participant  now project s the unemployment  rate to reach  4.5 percent at the end of this year and 3.5 percent by the end of 2023."
" With regards to inflation, the median inflation projection of FOMC participants is 2.4 percent this year and declines to 2 percent next year before moving back up to 2.1 percent in 2023."
" O ver the next few months, 12month measures of inflation are  expected t o move temporarily above our 2 percent  longer -run goal , owing to a run of  - 3 - yearover-year comparisons with depressed servicesector prices recorded in the spring of 2020 and supply bottlenecks limiting how quickly production can respond in the near term."
" However, I expect most of this increase to be transitory and for inflation to return to—or perhaps run somewhat above —our 2 percent  longer -run goal in 2022 and 2023."
" This outcome would be entirely consistent with the new f ramework we adopted in August 2020 and began to implement at our September 2020 FOMC meeting.3  In our new framework, we aim for inflation outcomes that keep inflation expectations well anchored at 2 percent ."
 This means that following periods when inflation has been running below 2 perc ent—as has been the case for most of the past  decade —monetary policy will aim for inflation to moderately exceed 2  percent  for some time .
" As announced in the September statement and reiterated in the following statements, with inflation running persis tently below 2  percent, our policy will aim to achieve inflation outcomes that keep inflation expectations well anchored at our 2 per cent longer -run goal.4  We expect to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomes —as well as our maximum -employment  3 The statement is available on the Board’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/review -ofmonetary -policy -strategy -tools -andcommunications -statement -onlonger -rungoals-monetary -policy -strategy.htm ."
" We also expect it will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the fe deral funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessments of maximum employment , until  inflation has risen to 2 percent , and  until inflation is  on track to moderately exceed 2 percent  for some time."
 We indicated that we will continue to increase our holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and our holdings of agency mortgage -backed securities by at least $40  billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward  our maximum -employment and price -stability goals.
   The changes to the policy statement that we made over the past few  FOMC meetings bring our policy guidance in line with the new framework outlined in the  revised Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy that the Committee approved last A ugust.
" In our new framework, we acknowledg e that  policy decisions going forward will be based on the FOMC’s estimates of “ shortfalls  [emphasis added] of employment from its maximum level” —not “deviations .”5  This language means that going forward, a low unemployment rate, in and of itself, will not be sufficient to trigger a tightening of monetary policy absent any evidence from other indicators that inflation is at risk of moving above mandate -consistent le vels."
" With regard to our  price -stability mandate, while the new statement maintains our definition that the longer -run goal for inflation is 2 percent, it elevates the importance—and the  5 The most recent version of the 2012 statement is available on the Board’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_LongerRunGoals_201901.pdf ."
" - 5 - challenge —of keeping inflation expectations well anchored  at 2 percent  in a world  in which an effectivelower -bound constraint is , in downturns, binding on the federal funds rate."
" To this end, the new statement conveys the Committee’s judgment that, in order  to anchor expectations at the 2 percent  level consistent with pr ice stability , it will conduct policy to achieve inflation outcomes that keep longrun inflation expectations anchored at our 2 percent  longer -run goal."
" As Chair Powell  indicated in his Jackson Hole remarks, we think of our new framework as an evolution f rom “flexible inflation targeting” to “flexible average inflation targeting.”6  While this new framework represents a robust evolution in our monetary policy strategy, this strategy is in service to the dual -mandate goals of monetary policy assigned to the Federal Reserve by the Congress—maximum employment and price stability —that remain  unchanged.7 Concluding Remarks While our interest rate and balance sheet tools are providing powerful  support  to the economy and will continue to do so as the recovery progresses, it will take some time for economic activity and employment to return to levels that prevail ed at the business cycle peak reached last February."
