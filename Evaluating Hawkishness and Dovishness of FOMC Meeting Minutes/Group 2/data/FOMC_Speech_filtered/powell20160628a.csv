"For release on delivery  7:00 p.m. EDT  (6 p.m. CDT ) June 28, 2016         Recent Economic Developments , Monetary Policy Considerations  and Longer -term Prospects      Remarks by   Jerome H."
" The D ual Mandate and  State of the Economy  As you know, t he Fed eral Reserve, through the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC),  is charged by the Congress with achieving  maximum employment and stable prices --the dual mandate ."
" For price stability, t he FOMC has adopted a goal of 2 percent for inflation , as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures ."
 Many other central banks in developed economies have adopted inflation goals centered around 2  percent .
"  The FOMC has not set a numerical  goal for maximum employment, because the longrun sustainable level of employment is determined mainly by nonmonetary factors  that are outside the Fed’s control, such as demographics , social change, and fiscal and regulatory policies."
" Nonetheless, four times a year , FOMC participant s write down their estimates of t he longer -run sustainable level of the unemployment rate  (which many interpret as the “natural rate”) ; at the recent June FOMC meeting the median estimate of that rate was 4.8  percent."
" I would say that  we have made substantial progress toward maximum employment, although there is still some room for improvement ."
 We have more work to do to assure that inflation moves  back up to our 2 percent  goal.
" After several years of strong job growth, employment is now over 5 million higher than  the pre -crisis peak in 2007."
" The unemployment rate has fallen from 10 percent in 2009 to 4.7 percent in May, essentially at the level that many observers identify as the natural rate."
"Even though  we are near the natural rate of unemployment, there is  still room for improvement on several margins."
 So the labor force participation rate is also a key determinant of the unemployment rate.
"Watson (1997), “How Precise are Estimates of the Natural Rate of Unemployment ?,” in Christina D."
"Romer, eds., Reducing Inflation: Motivation and Strategy  (Chicago: University of Chicago Press) puts the 95 percent confidence interval at 1½ percentage points on either side of the point estimate."
" From 2008 through 2013, participation dropped sharply by 3 percentage points , but has remained about flat , on net , since late 2013 in a context of strong job growth and declining unemployment."
"                                                     2 See Stephanie Aaronson, Tomaz Cajner, Bruce Fallick, Felix Galbis -Reig, Christopher Smith, and William Wascher ( 2014), “Labor Force Participation:  Recent Developments and Future Prospects,” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, Fall, pp."
" There are welcome signs of a firming in wages, seen most clearly in the data on average hourly earnings, which are rising faster than the sum of inflation and productivity growth ."
" For example, the Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow model, which bases its projection on a range of incoming monthly data, estimates growth of 2."
" While I wo uld not want to make too much of two monthly observations, the strength of the labor market has been a key feature of the recovery, allowing us to look through quarterly fluctuations in GDP growth."
 So the possible loss of momentum in job growth is worriso me.
"       Turning to the inflation part of the mandate, the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation has consistently run below our 2 percent  objective since the end of the financial crisis, with the exception of the “Arab Spring” period in 2011, when oil prices  temporarily  spiked."
" For the 12 months ending in April, total inflation was only 1 percent , while core inflation (excluding food and energy prices) was 1 -1/2 percent."
" Core inflation  - 5 - has been held down by falling import prices, owing in large part t o the rise in the dollar, as well as the indirect effects of lower oil prices."
" If the dollar and oil prices remain broadly stable going forward, inflation should move up over time to our 2 percent objective."
"  When I was first exposed to macroeconomics  in college, more than four decades ago, the view was that inflation was strongly influenced by  the amount of slack  in the economy."
 But the relationship between slack and inflation has weakened substantially over the years .
" In addition , inflation depends  importantly  on the inflation expectations of workers and firms."
" A widely shared view among economists today is that, unlike during the 1970s, expectations are no longer heavily influenced by fluctuations in  inflation, but are fairly constant, or  anchored ."
" For both these reasons, inflation has become  less responsive to cyclical changes  in the economy."
" We measure inflation  expectations through surveys of forecasters and the general public, and also through market readings on inflation swaps and “breakevens ,” which represent inflation compensation as measured by the difference between the return offered by nominal Treasury securities and that o ffered by TIPS."
" Some of this decline probably represents lower risk of high inflation, or an elevated liquidity preference for mu ch more heavily traded nominal T reasury securities, rather than expectations of lower inflation."
 S ome survey measures  of inflation expectat ions have also trended down.
" Given the importance of expectations  for determining inflation , these developments deserve , and receive, careful attention."
" While inflation expectations seem to me to remain  reasonably well anchored, it  - 6 - is essential that they remain so ."
" The only way to assure that anchoring is to achieve actual inflation of 2 percent , and I am strongly committed to that  objective ."
  Looking Ahead  My baseline expectation has been that our eco nomy is likely to continue on its path of growth at around 2 percent.
" As the economy tightens, I have expect ed that inflation will move up over time to the Committee’s 2 percent objective."
  Weakness  in economic activity  around the world and related bouts of financial volatility  have weighed on the performance of our  economy.
  Growth and inflation remain stubbornly low for most of our major trading partners .
" In China, stimulus measures should support growth in the near term, but may also slow China’s necessary transition away  from its export - and investment -led business model."
" As the global outlook evolves, it will be important to assess the implications for the U.S. economy , and for the stance of policy appropriate to foster continued progress toward our objectives of maximum employment an d price stability."
 I am oft en asked why rates remain so low now that we are near full employment.
 Estimates of the real interest rate needed to keep  the economy on an even keel if it were operating at 2  percent  inflation and full employment --the “neutral rate” of interest --are currently around zero.
" Today, the real short term interest rate is about negative 1 -1/4 percent , so policy is actually only moderately stimulative."
"  I anticipate that the neutral rate will move up over time, as some of the headwinds that have weighed on economic growth ease."
"  - 8 - Longer -term Considerations: Potential output, productivity , labor market fluidity, and business dynamism  I would like to take a step back from the current context and explore an issue that ought to rece ive more attention --the longe rrun potential growth rate of our economy."
 One reason for the low neutral rate of interest is that potential growth appears to have slowed.
" A growing body of research shows that deep recessions accompanied by severe financial crises often leave behind permanent damage.4  One recent analysis suggests that in about one -third of such cases there is no permanent damage; one -third of the time there is a permanent reduction in the level of potential output but not its subsequent growth rate; and one third of the time there is a reduction in both the level of potential output and in the growth rate.5  Unfortunately, many economies are currently in danger of falling into the third category, including the U.S. economy."
" Output growth can be broken dow n into increases in hours worked and changes in output per hour, or productivity."
 Most of the decline in estimated potential U.S. growth appears to be from lower productivity.
 Labor productivity growth began to slow around 2005-- before the crisis --and been only 1/2  percent  annually since 2011--the slowest five                                                    3 The longrange consensus U.S. economic projections for real GDP growth reported by Blue Chip Economic Indicators moved down from 2.9 percent in March 2007 to 2.1 percent in March 2016.
"5 See Olivier Blanchard, Eugenio Cerutti and Lawrence Summers (2015), “Inflation and Activity – Two Explorations and Their Monetary Policy Implications,” IMF Working Paper WP/15/230, 2015 (Washington: International Monetary Fund)."
" The productivity slowdown has been worldwide, and has been seen in countries that were not as strongly affected by the crisis, so U.S. specific factors are probably not the main cause.6   Increasing productivity is necessary if living standards are to continue to rise over generations."
 So two important questions arise:  Why has productivity growth been so slow?
 Labor productivity is a function of three things.
" The third determinant is called “total factor productivity, ” or TFP,  which refers to the ability of firms to produce more efficiently given the first two inputs."
" For example, as businesses learned how to inc orporate advances in information technology into their production processes, there was a surge of productivity growth from roughly 1995 to 2005."
  The weak performance of productivity since the crisis appears to stem mainly from weak business investment an d low TFP  growth .
 Weak business investment has result ed from weak demand and uncertainty about the pace of the recovery.
" TFP is equally important and has generally account ed for most of the variation in productivity  over time, but is less well understood  and so more difficult to forecast."
  The second question--what will happen wi th productivity going forward --is the subject of intense debate.
" The range of forecasts  is wide, and the historical record                                                    6 See, for example , “New OECD indicators trace productivity  growth slowdown pre - and post -crisis ,” http://www.oecd.org/economy/newoecdindicatorstraceproductivitygrowthslowdownpre -andpost -crisis.htm     - 10 - provides ample ground for humility."
" This summer, m any will be carrying Robert Gordon’s massive The R ise and Fall of American Growth to the beach (or perhaps  to the lake, here in the Midwest) , which argues the pessimist ic view."
"7  For balance, maybe bring along Brynjolfsson and McAfee’s The Second Machine Age , which take a more optimistic  view  and is a great deal shorter .8 One factor that may contribute to  low productivity growth is the notable decline in recent decades in measures of the dynamism of our economy ."
  Older firms shrink or go out of business if they  fail to keep up with innovation and advances in productivity.
 Start -ups:  Start -ups are a key driver of productivity growth.

" While the drop in the formation of lifestyle -type firms could be neutral or even  a positive for productivity, as in the case of the U.S. retail sector, the reduction in the creation of high -performance new firms suggests that lower dynamism could be as sociated with slower productivity growth .10 Labor Market Dynamism:  While c hanging jobs can be painful,  job changes in the aggregate are  associated with higher compensation, implying higher productivity."

" Some plausible sources of these changes are benign, while  others are more negative  and suggest that the reduction  in dynamism may be a  factor be hind the slower increases in productivity ."
" For example, historically there has been a robu st correlation at the firm level between productivity and growth, with high productivity levels being correlated with faster growth and low productivity levels being associated with contraction or exit."
" This relationship has weakened since 2000, particula rly in the high -tech sector.12  High productivity firms are  not grow ing as quickly,  and low productivity firms are shrink ing or exiting at a slower pace."
" Among the costs are that it  tends to reduce job switching and employment opportunities for excluded workers , and may restrict compe tition and thus increase prices faced by consumers ."
 It goes without saying that economic policymakers should use all available information and tools to create a supportive environment for growth .
" We need policies that support labor force participation and the development of skills, business hiring and inve stment, and productivity growth."
" Since 2011, j ob growth has been stronger and unemployment has declined faster than most forecast s."
" On the other hand, economic growth has been consistently lower than almost all private - and public -sector forecasts, including those of FOMC participants."
 Growth has been slower in this recovery than in many previous recoveries; a growin g body of research shows that weak  recoveries are the norm after deep recessions and those associated with severe financial crises.
" Monetary policy will need to remain supportive of growth,  as we work through the challenging global environment ."
" As always, it will be important to careful ly monitor economic developments in order to assess the stance of policy appropriate to foster continued progress toward our objectives of maximum employment and price stability."
