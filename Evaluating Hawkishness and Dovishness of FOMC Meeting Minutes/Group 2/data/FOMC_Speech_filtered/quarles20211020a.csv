 How High is Too High?:  Managing Recent Inflation Developments  within the FOMC’s Monetary Policy Framework     Remarks by   Randal K.
 This morning I’d like to  outline my view of current economic conditions and the economic outlook and then turn to the implications for monetary policy .
" In part icular, with employment still well below its February 2020 peak, I will focus on  how the escalation in inflation this year is testing the monetary policy f ramework adopted by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) in August 2020.1   Outlook for E conomic  Growth  Recent data suggest that growth in the third quarter is likely to be lower than we had expected, but the foundations remain in place for strong economic growth over the remainder of this year and next."
" Weaker  growth in payrolls  in August and September , along with uneven consumer spending in July and August , appear to reflect ongoing concerns in some parts of the country about the spread of COVID -19, especially  in highcontact service industries ."
" Supply bottlenecks  and labor  shortages that have been more widespread and persistent tha n many expected  are camouflaging  continued strong underlying demand for goods , services,  and workers ."
"  I expect that these developments , however, have for the most part simply postponed activity temporarily and that robust growth will return in the coming months ."
" The L abor Market C ontinues to S trengthen   Without a doubt, the headline job gains in August and September were lower than expected , but, as I will show , based on almost every other major labor market indicator, there is ample evidence that the demand for labor is strong."
" Another indicator I’ve  been watching closely is the so -called U6 unemployment rate, which consists of people who are working part  time but prefer fulltime work and discouraged workers who want a job but have given up looking."
" U -6 unemployment declined significantly over the past two months to 8.5 percent in September, roughly the same level as in the middle of 2017, when most everyone considered the job market to be quite healthy."
" Strong demand for labor  is outpacing supply, and, naturally , that development is putting upward pressure on wages."
"  I noted the imbalance between the demand and supply for labor, and some of the labor market indicators that are still well short of pre -COVID level s are those related to labor force participation , which has been about unchanged this year on balanc e."
" One reason is that a  disproportionate number of older workers responded to the initial shock of the COVID event by retiring, whi ch may be an area where  participation and employment struggle to retrace lost ground."
 Longer -lasting changes in labor force participation could make wage pressures more persistent and have implications for the assessment of maximum employment.
" Tapering Asset Purchases  Since the middle of last year , the Fed has been increasing its holdings of  Treasury securities and agency mortgage -backed securities by $120 billion a month to foster  smooth market  functioning and to support the economy by putting downward pressure on interest rates."
" Conditions  had improved considerably by the time  we announced our forward guidance for asset purchases in December, but the unemployment rate remained at 6.7 percent, near -term growth was being constrained by heightened social -distancing restrictions amid  surging hospitalizations from COVID -19, and inflation was running  - 4 - significantly below 2 percent."
" As we sit here today , demand for labor is strong , and unemployment has declined t o 4.8 percent ."
" Inflation, about which I will say more shortly, is running at more than twice the FOMC ’s longer -run goal."
"  Taking all of the  evidence into account, I think it is  clear that we have met the test of substantial further progress toward both our employment and our inflation mandates , and I would support a decision at our November meeting to start reducing  these purchases and comple te that process by the middle of next year ."
" Bear in mind that asset purchases are pressing down on the accelerator, adding each month to the amount of accommodation the Fed is providing to the economy through downward pressure on longer -term interest rates."
"  Monetary P olicy When the Goals A re Not Complementary  A move to reduce the pace of asset purchases soon also is entirely consistent with the F OMC’s plan to pursue our longer -run maximum -employment and price -stability goals, and our new monetary policy  strategy , which we refer to as our framework."
" L ast December , with  inflation running well below 2 percent and unemployment still elevated , we committed to continue purchasing assets at least at the current pace until we had made substantial further progress toward our goals."
" That is, high unemployment usually coincides  - 5 - with subdued inflationary pressures."
  But we are facing a situation now where inflation is hig h even though employment has yet to fully recover from the COVID event.
" In that case, according to the FOMC’s monetary policy framework, when objectives are not complementary, the Committee “ takes into account the employment shortfalls and inflation devia tions and the potentially different time horizons over which employment and inflation are projected to return to levels judged consistent with its mandate .”2  Applying those principles  throughout 2021, we have been very patient and focused  on the need for the labor market to recover as quickly as practicable from the severe damage experienced during the darkest days of the COVID event."
"  Early on, patience was easy:  In December  of last year, my FOMC colleagues and I were expecting much lower inflation —the median projection for 2021 by FOMC participants was 1.8 percent."
 T he FOMC’s preferred inflation gauge  did not crack 2 percent until March  2021.
 The median of the most recent projection s by FOMC participants traces a path in which inflation end s the year just a touch lower than the current level.
" Nonetheless, I do not see the FOMC as behind the curve , for three reasons:  Most of the biggest  drivers of the very  2 See the Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, paragraph 6, available on the Board’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/review -ofmonetary -policy -strategy -tools -andcommunications -statement -onlonger -rungoals -monetary -policy -strategy.htm ."
"  - 6 - high current inflation rates will ease in com ing quarters , some measures of underlying inflation pressures are less worrisome, and  longer -term inflation expectations are anchored, at least for now ."
 T he inflation we have experien ced so far has been very unusual and largely  related to supply constraints associated both with production and distribution problems related to COVID and with a demand shock arising from the unprecedented and rapid reopening of the economy.
"  Second, i f we recognize that much of the excessive inflation we ar e seeing  this year is directly attributable to disruptions that, like the COVID event, will end, then monetary policy often can look through those types of disruptions to consider what inflation will be in the future when this episode passes."
" To get a fix on where inflation is headed, i t is helpful to consider measures of inflation that  try to filter out the most unusual and presumably transitory price increases that may be driving headline inflation."
" The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas ’s trimmed mean measure of inflation systematically removes prices that are increasing or decreasing at abnormally large rates, in order to get some perspective on underlying inflation pressures."
" For the 12 months through August , the Dallas t rimmed m ean inflation was an even 2 percent."
" Of course, while this metric may provide a better indicator of future PCE (personal consumption expenditures)  - 7 - inflation, I do not mean to suggest that this is necessarily a better reading on current inflation —consumers  and businesses have to pay for the goods wh ose prices  have risen sharply, and those increases are being  felt."
  That brings us to the third reason that I do not think the FOMC is behind the curve: anchored  inflation expectations.
  We monitor longer -term e xpectation s of future inflation  because we believe they influence changes in actual inflation over the medium term.
" In fact, our new framework recognizes that stable, well -anchored inflation expectations help return inflation to 2 percent when it is runni ng high, as it is now, as well as when it has fallen somewhat below that goal, as it often does during a recession."
" So far, m arket -based measures of longer -term inflation expectations, as well as surveys of professional forecasters, have increased only moderately this year, moves that more  or less reversed declines in those expectations over the previous half -dozen years."
" Measuring expectations is an inexact science, but  smoothing through the ups and downs in expectations in recent years leaves these indicators within a range that has been consistent with inflation near our 2 percent goal."
"  Going forward, t he question is not  only whether inflation will fall in the coming months, but also how far it will fall and if it will fall soon enough to avoid spurring a concerning rise in longer -term inflation expectations ."
 I agree with my FOMC colleagues and most private forecasters that inflation likely will decline considerably next year from its currently very eleva ted rate .
" For instance, most of the September S ummary of Economic P rojections  forecasts for PCE inflation in 2022 w ere between 1.9 and  - 8 - 2.3 percent, with a minimum of 1.7 percent and a maximum of  3.0 percent.3  But  I see significant  upside risks to my current  inflation outlook."
" As noted earlier , labor supply constraints are  making it diffic ult for businesses to keep up with demand."
" This dynamic  will continue to support robust wage growth, put ting further upward pressure on prices ."
" The fundamental dilemma that we face at the Fed right now is this:  D eman d, augmented by unprecedented fiscal stimulus, has been outstripping a temporarily disrupted supply, leading to high inflation."
" But the  fundamental productive capacity of our economy as it existed just before COVID —and, thus, the ability to satisfy that demand without inflation —remains largely as it was, and the factors that are disrupting it appear to be transitory."
" Looked at purely  in that light, constraining demand now, to bring it into line with a transiently interrupted supply, would be premature."
" Given the lags with which  monetary policy acts, we could easily find that demand is damping just as supply is increasing , leading us to undershoot our inflation target —and, in the worst case, we could depress the incentives for supply to return, leading to an extended period of sluggish activity and unnecessarily low employment."
" But “transitory” does not necessarily mean “short  lived .”  Indeed, we are discovering that it’s going to take more time than we had thought for supply to return to normal , and with demand already high during that time, I am monitoring the extent to  3 The September 2021 Summary of Economic Projections is available on the Board’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm ."
" If those dynamic s should lead this  “transitory” inflation  to continue too long, it could affect the planning of hous eholds and businesses and unanchor their inflation expectations."
"” I am among those who see a good chance that inflation will remain above 2 percent  next year , but I  am not quite ready to conclude that this “transitory” period is already “too long.”   We haven’t yet met  the more stringent tests for liftoff that we have laid out in forward guidance about  the federal funds rate."
"  Let me quote from the latest FOMC statement:  Raising rates will not be appropriate “until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee’ s assessments of m aximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.”4  Importantly, the level of uncertainty around the paths for inflation and employment are higher than normal as we navigate the unprecede nted reopening of the world economy."
" Therefore, we will remain outcome based, waiting to see further improvements in employment and the evolution of inflation pressures in coming months ."
" And , if the broadly held expectation that inflation will recede nex t year turns out to be wrong or if inflation expectations show signs of becoming unanchored  to the upside , I am confident that the monetary policy tools at our disposal can bring inflation down toward our 2 percent  goal."
" I said just now that the central question is “How long is too long?”   I am also keenly aware, however, that inflation of 4 percent or more certainly cannot be characterized as only “moderately ” above 2 percent , and thus we also have to deal with the question of “How high is too high?”  Moreover, the two questions are obviously related:  we can tolerate inflation of 2.5  percent  as supply returns to normal without dramatically affecting inflation expectations, for a much longer period than we can tolera te inflation of 4.5 percent ."
"  In 2012, the FOMC formally adopted a longer -run inflation target of 2 percent, and since then , that target has been reaffirmed annually by the Committee  including in our new framework adopted in August 2020.5  The key innovations in the new framework relative to the previous incarnation are designed primarily to address the risk that inflation and  inflation expectations could settle below our 2 percent target."
 Th at risk emanates from t he understanding that several longer -run changes in the U.S. economy may have conspired to reduce the level of the equilibrium federal funds rate —the level at which it is neither slowing nor speeding up economic activity.
" In turn, a lower average level of interest rates would make it more difficult, on balance, for the Federal Reserve to respond to negative shocks to the economy with sizable cuts to interest rates."
" The inability to cut interest rates sufficiently can then reinforce downward pressures on  5 See the Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy,” in note 2 ."
 - 11 - inflation such that it begins to run persistently below the FOMC’s 2 percent goal and causes inflation expectations to fall with it.
"      As is well known by now , those revisions to the Fed’s monetary policy framework put new emphasis on reaching maximum employment  and introduc ed new flexibility in how to account for progress toward our price -stability  goal  by seeking inflation that averages 2 percent over time  to ensure longer -term inflation expectations remain anchored at this level ."
" This revision implies that monetary policy will provide more support for economic activity over a typical business cycle tha n had been the case , in order to prevent longer -term infla tion expectations —and, ultimately , inflation itself —from settling below 2 percent."
"  In this low interest rate environment, some researchers have suggested going further than our current framework does in allowing inflation to run moderately above 2 percen t for some time following periods where it has run persistently lower than 2 percent, and actually rais ing the inflation target to 2.5 percent or 3 percent or even 4 percent.6  At the outset of  our recently completed review , we reaffirmed  that inflation a t a rate of 2 percent is most consistent over the longer run with our congressional mandate  for price stability .7  I believe that a ny future discussion of a higher  target would need  to address whether it remained consistent with that congressional  mandate."
" I would also emphasize that at this point, the public is very accustomed to a world of inflation near 2  6 See Lawren ce M."

" Research shows that such certainty is valuable for households and business es to make sound financial decisions and to avoid economic distortions that could hinder economic growth.8 My strong support for our  consensus framework is predic ated not only upon i ts new features designed  to address inflation that falls too low, but also its commitment to prevent longer -term inflation expectations from rising materially above a level consistent with our 2 percent  goal ."
" In this sense, the current  elevated rates of inflation are not challenging our new framework any more than they would have challenged our previous framework or, for that matter, most reasonable frameworks for conducting monetary policy."
" A s I said earlier , when our price -stability and employment goals are not complementary, the framework calls for policy to depend on the remaining shortfall from our maximumemployment goal, on the extent to which inflation continues to exceed 2 percent, and on the amount of time we expect it will ta ke for employment and inflation to meet our goals."
 But t hat forecast for growth and uncertainty about the resolution of supply constraints mean that there are upside risks to inflation next year .
" So my focus is beginning to turn more fully from the rapidly improving labor market to whether inflation  begins its descent  toward levels that are more consistent with our price -stability mandate , as most forecasters and most  of my colleagues on the FOMC  8 See Engin  Kara and Tony Yates (2021), “A Case against a 4% Inflation Target,” Journal of Money, Credit and Banking,  vol."
 I would als o be quite wary of further increases in inflation expectations  in this environment .
" If inflation does remain more  than moderately above 2 percent , be assured that the FOMC has the framework and the tools to address it."
