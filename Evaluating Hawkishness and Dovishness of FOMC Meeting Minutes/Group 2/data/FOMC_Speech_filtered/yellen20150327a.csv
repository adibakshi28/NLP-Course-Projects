"Yellen   Chair   Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at  “The New Normal Monetary Policy ,” a research c onference  sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco   San Francisco, California         March 27, 2015    I would like to thank President Williams for his kind introduction and the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco for inviting me to what promises to be a very stimulating and important conference."
" Of course, the timing of the first increase in the federal funds rate and its subsequent path will be determined by the Committee in light of incomin g data on labor market conditions, inflation, and other aspects of the  current expansion."
  In my remarks today I will discuss some factors that will likely guide our decisions as we adjust the stance of monetary policy over time .
" Second, how are economic and financial considerations likely to shape the course of monetary policy over the next several years?"
" Current Economic Condi tions and the Outlook  Before turning to these questions, however, let me first review where the economy is now and where it’s likely headed --a necessary backdrop for understandin g why, after more than six years of maintaining a near -zero federal funds rate and accumulating a large portfolio of longer -term securities, the Committee is now giving  - 2 - serious consideration to begin ning to reduce  later this year some of the extraordinary monetary policy accommodation currently in place."
" The unemployment rate has fallen markedly over the past few years and now stands at 5.5 percent, down from 10 percent at its peak."
" Payroll gains have averaged 275,000 per month over the past year , well above the pace needed to sustain further declines in the unemployment  rate."
" Of course , we still have some way to go to reach our maximum employment goal."
 The unemployment rate has not yet declined to the 5.0 to 5.2 percent range  that most FOMC participants now consider to be normal in the longer run.
 Labor force participation is still somewhat lower than I would expect after accounting for demographic trends.1  And wage growth continues to be quite subdued.
"I am cautiously optimistic that, in the context of moderate growth in aggregate output and spending, labor market conditions are likely to i mprove further in coming months."
" In particular, and despite the somewhat disa ppointing tone of the recent retail 1 For a discussion of the influence of demographics and other factors on the labor force participation rate in recent years, see Stephanie Aaronson, Tomaz Cajner, Bruce Fallick, Felix Galbis -Reig, Christopher Smith, and William Wascher (2014), “Labor Force P articipation:  Recent Developments and Future Prospects,” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity (Washington:  Brookings Institution, Fall), www.brookings.edu/about/projects/bpea/papers/2014/labor -force -participation -recent -developments -andfuture -prospects ."
"                                                   - 3 - sales data, I think consumer spending is likely to expand at a good clip this year given such robust fundamentals as strong employment gains, boosts to real incomes from lower  energy prices, continued increases in household wealth, and a relatively high level of consumer confidence."
" But overall, I anticipate that real gross domestic product is likely to expand somewhat faster than its potential in coming quarters, thereby promoting further gains in employment and declines in the unemployment rate."
" While the overall level of real activity now appears to be much closer to its potential than it was a year or two ago, the economy in an “underlying ” sense remains quite weak by historical standards, for the simple reason that the increases in hiring and output that have been achiev ed thus far have required exceptionally low levels of short - and longer -term interest rates, reflecting a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy."
" Interest rates have been, and remain, very low, and if underlying conditions had truly returned to normal, the economy should be booming."
" While there has been considerable progress on the maximum employment leg of our dual mandate, progress on the price stability leg has been notably absent."
" Inflation as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures has been running  - 4 - below the FOMC’s longer -run goal of 2 percent for  a number of years, and on a 12month basis  is currently 1/4 percent."
 Some of the weakness in inflation likely reflects continuing slack in labor and product markets.
" However, much of this weakness stems from the sharp decline in the price of oil and other one -time factors that, in the FOMC ’s judgment, are likely to have only a transitory negative effect on inflation, provided that inflation expectations remain well anchored."
"  In this regard, I take comfort from the continued stability of survey measures of longer -run inflation expectations ."
" And although market -based measures of inflation compensation have declined appreciably since last summer and bear close watching, I suspect that these declines are primarily driven by changes in risk premiums and market factors that I expect to prove trans itory ."
" On balance, I therefore think it is appropriate for monetary policy to remain accommodative for some time, fostering an environment of tightening labor and product markets that, together with stable inflation expectations, will help move inflation up to 2 percent over the medium term."
 I would first note that the current stance of monetary policy is clearly providing considerable economic stimulus.
" Second, we need to keep in mind the well -established fact that the full effects of monetary policy are felt only after long lags."
" I would not consider it prudent to postpone the onset of normalizatio n until we have reached, or are on the verge of reaching, our inflation objective."
" Doing so would create too great a risk of significantly overshooting both our objectives of maximum sustainable employment and 2 percent inflation, potentially undermining economic growth and employment if the FOMC is subsequently forced to tighten policy markedly or abruptly."
" That said, we must be reasonably confident at the time of the first rate increase that inflation will move up over time to our 2 percent objective , and that such an action will not impede continued solid growth in employment and output."
 An important factor working to increase my confidence in the inflation outlook will be continued improvement in the labor market.
" A substantial body of theory, informed by considerable historical evidence, suggests that inflation will eventually begin to rise as resource utilization continues to tighten.2  It is largely for this reason that a 2 For recent evidence on the relationship between labor market slack and wages, see Anil Kumar and Pia Orrenius (2014), “A Closer Look at the Phillips Curve Using State Level Data,” Working Papers 1409 (Dallas:  Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas), www.dallasfed.org/assets/documents/research/papers/2014/wp1409.pdf ; and Daniel Aaronson and Andrew Jordan (2014), “Understanding the Relationship between Real Wage Growth and Labor Market Conditions,” Chicago Fed Letter No. 327 (Chicago:  Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, October), www.chicagofed.org/publications/chicago -fedletter/2014/october -327."
 The price Phillips curve is                                                   - 6 - significant pickup in incoming readings on core inflation will not  be a precondition for me to judge that an initial increase in the federal funds rate would be warranted.
" With respect to wages, I anticipate that real wage gains for American workers are likely to pick up to a rate more in line with trend labor productivity growth as employment settles in at its maximum sustainable level."
 We could see nominal wag e growth eventually running notably higher than the current roughly 2 percent pace.
 But the outlook for wages is highly uncertain even if price inflation does move back to 2 percent and labor market conditions continue to improve as projected.
" For exampl e, we can not be sure about the future pace of productivity growth; nor can we be sure about other factors, such as global competition, the nature of technological change, and trends in unionization, that  may also influence the pace of real wage growth over  time."
" These factors, which are outside of the Federal Reserve’s control, likely explain why real wages have failed to keep pace with productivity growth for at least the past 15 years."
" For such reasons, we can never be sure what growth rate of nominal w ages is consistent with stable consumer price inflation, and this uncertainty limits the usefulness of wage trends as an indicator of the Fed’s progress in achieving its inflation objective."
    I have argued that a pickup in neither wage nor price inflati on is indispensable for me to achieve reasonable confidence that inflation will move back to 2 percent over time.

"  Under normal circumstances, simple monetary policy rules, such as the one proposed by John Taylor, could help us decide when to raise the federal funds rate.3  Even with core inflation running below the Committee's 2 percent objective, Taylor’s rule now calls for the federal funds rate to be well above zero if t he unemployment rate is currently judged to be close to its normal longer -run level and the “normal” level of the real federal funds rate is currently close to its historical average."
" But the prescription offered by the Taylor rule changes significantly i f one instead assumes, as I do, that appreciable slack still remains in the labor market , and that the economy’s equilibrium real federal funds rate--that is, the real rate consistent with the economy achieving maximum employment and price stability over the medium term--is currently quite low by historical standards.4  Under assumptions that I consider more realistic under present circumstances, the same rules call for the federal funds rate to be close to zero.5  3 For the original exposition of the Taylor rule, see John B."
"Williams (2010), “Simple and Robust Rules for Monetary Policy,” in Benjamin M."
"    4 The equilibrium real rate is typically viewed as the level of the shortterm interest rate, less inflation, estimated to be consistent with maximum employment and stable inflation in the long run, assuming no future disturbances to the economy."
" Accordingly, the equilibrium real rate is usually thought of as independent of the cyclical disturbances that routinely buffet the economy, on the assumption that the influences of such disturbances on real activity and inflation fade away after a few years ."
" These atypical processes imply that, in determining the appropriate stance of monetary policy over time, policymakers in the current environment need to take account of slow -moving influences on both aggregate demand and supply that were not important factors during previous tightening episodes."
" 5 For example, the Taylor rule is 𝑅𝑅 𝑡𝑡=𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅∗+𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡+0.5(𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡−2)+0.5𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡, where R denotes the federal funds rate, RR* is the estimated value of the equilibrium real rate, π is the current inflation rate (usually measured                                                   - 8 - Moreover, I would assert that simple rules  are, well, too simple, and ignore important complexities of the current situation, about which I will have more to say shortly."
" But the si gnificance of this decision should not be overemphasized , because what matters for financial conditions and the broader economy is the entire expected path of short -term interest rates and not the precise timing of the first rate increase."
" The spending an d investment decisions the FOMC seeks to influence depend primarily on expectations of policy well into the future, as embedded in longer -term interest rates and other asset prices."
" Market par ticipants’ perceptions of that reaction function and the implications for the likely longer -run trajectory of short -term interest rates will influence the borrowing costs faced by households and businesses, including the rates on corporate bonds, auto loans, and home mortgages."
"  Let me therefore turn to the second question I posed earlier:  How are  economic and financial considerations likely to shape the course of monetary policy over the next using a  core consumer price index), and Y  is the output gap."
" The latter can be approximated using Okun’s law, 𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡=−2(𝑈𝑈𝑡𝑡−𝑈𝑈∗), where U is the unemployment rate and U*  is the natural rate of unemployment."
" If RR* is assumed to equal 2 percent (roughly the average historical value of the real federal funds rate) and U* is assumed to equal 5 -1/2 percent, then the Taylor rule would call for the nominal funds rate to be set a bit below 3 percent currently, given that core PCE inflation is now running close to 1 -1/4 pe rcent and the unemployment rate is 5.5 percent."
" Rather, the actual path of policy will evolve as economic conditions evolve, and policy tightening could speed up, slow down, pause, or even reverse course depending on actual and expected developments in real activity and inflation."
" Our goal in adjusting the federal funds rate over time will be to achieve and sustain economic conditions close to maximum employment with inflation averaging around 2 percent, responding, as best we can, to the inevitabl e twists and turns of the economy."
" Keeping in mind the allimportant proviso that policy is never predetermined but is always data dependent, what can we say about the appropriate path of policy , assuming the most likely outcomes for real activity, inflation, and related factors?"
" As I noted at my press conference after last week ’s FOMC meeting, participants generally project that the unemployment rate will continue to fall through late 2017 to levels at or somewhat bel ow estimates of its longer -run sustainable level, accompanied by growth in real gross domestic product that runs somewhat above its  - 10 - estimated longer -run trend with inflation moving up to around 2 percent."
 This solid economic performance is projected to be consistent with a gradual normalization of monetary policy:   The median funds rate projection in the March SEP increases a percentage point per year on average through the end of 2017.
"  Fortunately, the overall force of these headwinds appears to have diminished considerably over the past year or so, allowing employment to accelerate appreciably even as the level of the federal funds rate and the volume of our asset holdings remained nearly unchanged.6  Stated differently, the economy’s underlying strength has been 6 Although the FOMC suspended its asset purchase program last October, the stimulus provided by this type of unconventional monetary policy action depends primarily on the stock of longer -term assets held by the Federal Reserve, not the flow of securities bought."
" Because the FOMC has held the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet constant since October while continuing to keep the federal funds rate near zero, the overall stance of monetary policy is thus little changed over this period."
" However, the downward pressure on longterm interest rates from the Federal Reserve’s asset holdings should decline over time, particularly after the FOMC suspends its current reinvestment policy, because the average duration of the assets held in the portfolio will be steadily falling and because the relative size of the portfolio to the stock of publicly held debt will be shrinking."
" The median SEP estimate of this longer -run normal rate --that is, the long -run projection of the nominal funds rate less 2 percent inflation --stood at 13/4 percent in the FOMC's recent projections.8  Provided that inflation shows clear signs over time of moving up toward 2 percent in the context of continuing progress toward maximum employment, I therefore expect that a further tightening in monetary policy after the first increase in the federal funds  rate will be warranted."
" 7 If resource utilization was at a normal level and inflation was equal to 2 percent, policymakers would presumably opt to set the real federal funds rate equal to the equilibrium real rate in order to maintain those conditions."
" Accordingly, if the equilibrium rate is rising over time, the “neutral” setting of monetary policy  should be rising in tandem."
" As I noted, my FOMC colleagues and I generally anticipate that a rather gradual rise in the federal funds rate will be appropriate over the next few years, conditional on our baseline forecasts for real activity, inflation , and othe r aspects of the economy’s performance."
" Keeping in mind that the actual course of monetary policy in the future will primarily depend on events as they unfold, I see three additional considerations that are relevant.9   The first, which is closely related to my expectation that the headwinds holding back growth are likely to continue to abate gradually, pertains to the risk that the equilibrium real federal funds rate may not, in fact, recover as much or as quickly as I 9 In principle, the three considerations --uncertainty about the value of the equilibrium real federal funds rate, the asymmetric risks associated with the zero lower bound on nom inal interest rates, and the potential benefits of allowing the unemployment rate to temporarily undershoot its sustainable longer -run rate --should influence both the timing of the onset of policy normalization and the subsequent pace at which that normali zation proceeds."
" I also view such considerations as consistent with a likely increase in the target federal funds rate later this year, because such an increase would be part of a broader strategy for only gradually reducing accommodation over time (subject, of course, to adjustments in response to incoming information on real activity, inflation, and other factors)."
" Substantial uncertainty surrounds all estimates of the equilib rium real interest rate, and , as I will discuss momentarily, market participants appear to be fairly pessimistic about the odds that it will rise significantly over time."
" Moreover, some recent studies have raised the prospect that the economies of the Uni ted States and other countries will grow more slowly in the future as a result of both demographic factors and a slower pace of productivity gains from technological advances."
" At an extreme, such developments could even amount to a type of “secular stagna tion,” in which monetary policy would need to keep real interest rates persistently quite low relative to historical norms to promote full employment and price stability, absent a highly expansive fiscal policy.10   Such a risk has important implications for monetary policy in the near term, when the ability of the economy to adjust to significant rate increases will be especially uncertain."
 International experience therefore counsels caution in removing accommodation until the Committee is more confident that aggregate demand will 10 The concept of “secular stagnation” was first coined back in the late 1930s; see Alvin H.

" In the event that growth in employment and overall activity proves unexpectedly robust and inflation moves significantly above our 2 percent objective, the FOMC can and will raise interest rates as needed to rein in inflation."
" But if growth was  to falter and inflation was to fall yet further, the effective lower bound on nominal interest rates could limit the Committee ’s ability to provide the needed degree of accommo dation."
"  Research suggests that, the higher the probability of monetary policy becoming constrained by the zero lower bound in the near future because of adverse shocks, and the more severe the attendant consequences for real activity and inflation, the more current policy should lean in accommodative direction.12  In effect, such a strategy represents insur ance against the zero lower bound by aiming for somewhat stronger real activity and 11 A number of studies have shown, using model simulations, that policymakers can improve macroeconomic performance by adjusting the stance of monetary policy more cautiously in response to changes in economic conditions when the economy’s equilibrium real interest rate is uncertain."

" Given the modal outlook envisioned in FOMC participants’ recent forecasts, with headwinds continuing to diminish, the equilibrium real rate rising, and inflation moving back up to 2 percent over the next few years, the risk that the funds rate would need to return to near zero should be declining appreciably."
" Consi stent with this assessment, almost all FOMC participants n ow view the risks to the outlook for real activity as largely balanced, although some also see inflation risks as weighted to the downside."
" For example, respondents to the Survey of Primary Dealers in late January thought there was a 20 percent probability that, after liftoff, the funds rate would fall back to zero sometime at or before late 2017.13  In addition, both the remarkably l ow level of long -term government bond yields in advanced economies and the low prevailing level of inflation compensation suggest that financial market participants may hold more pessimistic views than FOMC participants concerning the risks to the global outlook."
" Since long -term yields reflect the market’s probability -weighted average of all possible short -term interest rate paths, along with compensating term and risk premiums, the generally low level of yields in advanced economies suggests that investor s place considerable odds on adverse scenarios that would necessitate a lower and flatter trajectory of the federal funds than envisioned in participants’ modal SEP projections.14  13 See Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Markets Group (2015), Responses to Survey of Primary Dealers  (New York:  FRBNY, January), www.newyorkfed.org/markets/survey/2015/January -result.pdf ."
"14 Of course, low longterm yields in the United States may not reflect investor pessim ism about U.S. economic prospects but instead an expectation that weak economic performance abroad may result in persistent upward pressure on the dollar, thereby putting downward pressure on U.S. net exports, employment, inflation, and thus shortterm int erest rates."
" On a closely related issue concerning evidence that investors’ perceptions of the likelihood of high inflation versus low inflation have shifted noticeably in                                                   - 16 - A final argument for gradual ly adjusting policy relates to the desirability of achieving a prompt return of inflation to the FOMC’s 2 percent goal, an objective that would be advanced by allowing the unemployment rate to decline for a time somewhat below estimates of its longer -run sustainable level."
" Proceeding too slowly to tighten policy could have adverse consequences for the attainment of the Committee ’s inflation objective over time, especiall y if it were to undermine the FOMC ’s inflation credibility."
" Inflation could, for example, exhibit nonlinear dynamics in which high levels of unemployment place relatively little downward pressure on inflation, but tight labor markets generate marked upwar d pressure."
