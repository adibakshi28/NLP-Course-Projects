"Yellen   Chair   Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at  “Monetary Policy  Implementation and Transmission in the Post -Crisis Period ,”  a research conference sponsored by  the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   Washington, D.C.         November 12, 2015   It is my pleasure to welcome you to the Federal Reserve Board’s conference on “Monetary Policy Implementation  and Transmission in the Post -Crisis Period.”  The conference aims to bring together academic and central bank economists, financial market practitioners, and policymakers to stimulate debate and research on a topic that is critically important to the Fede ral Reserve’s mission of conducting monetary policy in  the pursuit of maximum employment and stable prices."
" The global financial crisis had profound effects on our economy,  and it altered the way many think about monetary policy."
" At the peak of the crisi s and during its immediate aftermath, unconventional monetary policy measures were designed and implemented by the Federal Reserve and other central banks around the world."
 The post -crisis period has offered policymakers an opportunity to assess a range of novel policy and operational issues associated with the conduct of monetary policy and the effectiveness of different policy options.
" Moreover, policymakers should be mindful of new channels for monetary policy transmission that may have emerged from the intricate economic and financial linkages in our global economy that were revealed  by the crisis."
" Finally, it is crucial to understand the effect  of regulations and possible changes in financial intermediation on monetary policy implementation and transmission."
" The impressive conference program covers the  following topics in three sess ions:  monetary policy implementation,  the transmission of monetary policy , and the effect of regulation and financial intermediation on monetary policy implementation and transmission ."
" Looking ahead to later today, I am delighted that Vice Chairman Fischer will deliver keynote remarks on the exchange rate mechanism in the transmission of monetary policy."
 Tomorrow the conference concludes with two interesting policy panels on the effect  of regulations on monetary policy and the “optimal design” of monetary policy in the postcrisis world.
 Let me also say that I consider the topics covered during this conference highly relevant for the Federal Reserve System’s ongoing efforts to evaluate potential long -run monetary policy implementation frameworks and to assess a number of  issues related to the consideration of alternative frameworks.
" As I have often str essed before, in addition to its responsibilities for monetary policy and financial regulation and supervision, the Federal Reserve takes very seriously its role as a research institution."
" I want to thank our research conference committee for putting toge ther this highcaliber research conference, which has gathered distinguished speakers and guests from around the world and , I am sure , will add to our understanding of the implementation and transmission of monetary policy."
