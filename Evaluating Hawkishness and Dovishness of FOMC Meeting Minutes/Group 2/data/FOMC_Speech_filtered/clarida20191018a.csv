"For release on delivery  11:30 a.m. E DT October 18, 2019          U.S. Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy     Remarks by   Richard H."
" Before we begin our conversation, I would like to share a few thoughts about the outlook for the U.S.  economy and monetary policy.1 The U.S. economy is in a good place , and the baseline outlook is favorable ."
" The median expectation from Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) participants’ most recent Summary of Economic Projections is  for GDP growth to be around  2 percent in 2019, for growth to continue near this pace next year, and for personal consumption expenditures ( PCE) inflation to r ise gradually to our symmetric 2 percent objective.2   The unemployment rate, at 3.5 percent , is at a half -century low , and wages are rising broadly in line with productivity growth and underlying inflation."
 There is no evidence to date that a strong labo r market is putting excessive  costpush pressure on price inflation.
" Global growth estimates continue to be marked down , and global disinflationary pressures cloud the outlook for U .S."
inflation.
" Over the 12 months through August, PCE inflation is running at 1.4 percent, and core PCE inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, is running at 1."
" - 2 - Turning now to monetary policy, a t both its July and September meetings, the FOMC voted to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points.3  With these decisions , the current target range for the federal funds rate is 1.75 to 2 percent , which compares with the range of 2.25 to  2.5 percent that prevailed between  December 2018 and July 2019."
 The Committee took t hese actions to provide a some what more accommodative policy in response to muted inflation  pressures  and the risks to the outlook I mentioned earlier.
"  Looking ahead, monetary policy is not on a pre set course , and the Committee  will proce ed on  a meeting -bymeeting basis to assess the economic outlook as w ell as the risks to the outlook , and it will act as appropriate to sustain growth, a strong labor market, and a return  of inflation to our symmetric 2 percent objective."
" In addition, the Federal Reserve will continue to conduct term and overnight re po operations at least through January to ensure that the supply of reserves remains ample even during periods of temporary, but pronounced, increases in our nonreserve liabilities, and to mitigate the risk that money market pressures adversely affect monetary policy implementation."
" In those programs, the Federal Reserve was seeking to ease finan cial conditions by                                                  4 See the Statement Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation and Balance Sheet Normalization, which is available on the Board’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20190130c.htm ."
" 5 See the Statement Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation, which can be found on the Board’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20191011a.htm ."
"  The technical measures  we are undertaking  do not represent a change in the stance of monetary policy , which we continue to implement by adjusting the target range for the federal funds rate."
" This review of our monetary policy strategy, tools, and communications  is the first of its kind for the Federal Reserve."
 We will draw on these insig hts as we assess how best to achieve and maintain maximum employment and price stability in the most robust fashion possible.
