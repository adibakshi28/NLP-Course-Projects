 I w ill share some perspective  on how our  liquidity regulations work together and are supportive of  market functioning and the smooth implementation of monetary policy.
 The Intersection of Monetary Policy Tools and Supervision and Regulation  We consider how all of the Fed’s tools work  together to support our  objectives .
" In previous speeches, I  have talked about t he role of  the discount window and the standing repo f acility  (SRF) in supporting both monetary policy implementation and financial stability, noting how import ant it is that  eligible institutions be ready to use these facilities.2  Today I want to dig into this topic a bit more, including how these tools support monetary policy implementation through appropriate incorporation into liquidity regulations and supervisory practices."
"  This feature is important because, while it allows firms  to manage their liquidity buffers more flexibly, it also allows for greater flexibility in our monetary policy implementation  and it supports market  functioning ."
"  When firms understand that they will not be fully constrained by the capacity of private markets or their individual credit lines to monetize HQLA  immediately in stress, they can reduce their demand for reserves in favor of  Treasury securities, all  else being equal , for their stress planning purposes ."
" When banks exhibit a high degree of substitutability of demand for these assets, money market functioning improves."
" If a bank sees holding reserves and investing in Treasury repo as near substitutes in its liquidity portfolio, it should lend into Treasury repo markets when repo rates rise above the interest rate earned on reserves."
" The point at which banks , in aggregate, have a relatively  immutable demand for reserves, and are unwilling to lend them out, is evident when a small decrease in the supply of reserves result s in a sharp increase in the cost to borrow  them ."
 Our monetary policy tools are well positioned to help us avoid this outcome .
 I t is also critical that banks recognize and manage the interest rate and liquidity  risk of their securities portfolios  to ensure  those securities held for liquidity purposes  can be monetized in stress without creating  other adverse effects on a firm’s safety and soundness.
" In addition, as I have discussed previously, we identified significant gaps in interest rate risk management in the March 2023 banking stress, including in portfolios of highly liquid securities ."
"  - 9 - These enhancements to our liquidity regulations will help bolster firms’  ability  to manage  liquidity shocks, and they w ill also be well integrated with our monetary policy tools and framework."
