"Waller   Member     Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at  “The Future of Macroeconomic Policy ,” a conference sponsored by  the Norges Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the IMF Economic Review   Oslo, Norway         June 16, 2023   I have been asked to talk about monetary policy and financial stability in today’s economic environment.1  The r ecent stress in  the U.S. banking system has brought these two topics, their interlinkages,  and the tools we use to achieve our goals  to the forefront of central bank policy and public discourse ."
" In short, although financial stability and monetary policy  tools are used independently, they are nevertheless inter connected via their respective effe cts on the macroeconomy."
   Financial  stability is essential for monetary policy in the U nited S tates to achieve its congressionally mandated goals of maximum employment and price stability.
" Financial stability depends on a healthy economy, and all else equal is strengthened by monetary policy actions take n to promote our macroeconomic goals."
" A rapid, sizable increase in interest rates resulting from persistently e levated inflation contributed  1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee."
" Despite the interconnections  between maximum employment, price stability, and financial stability , the tools we use to promote f inancial stability are separate and distinct from the tools we use to carry out monetary policy ."
" Importantly, these actions  to address financial stability enabled us to continue to pursue  our monetary policy objectives during these times."
" Compared with financial stability tools that address liquidity or other strains in targeted individual institutions or segments of the finan cial system, monetary policy affects everyone and every part of the econom y and would be a blunt and less effective  - 3 - tool to address financial stability problems."
" That said, in carrying out monetary policy , we do consider  how credit conditions and other factors related to  financial stability are affecting the economy."
" As I argued in a speech last month , the recent strains in the banking sector  may lead to a tightening of price and nonprice conditions for lending.2  If that is the case, then it might reduc e the need for at least some further tightening of monetary policy to lower inflation ."
" The Federal O pen M arket C ommittee  held t wo unscheduled meetings where , recogniz ing that the coronavirus would weigh on economic activity and pose risks to the economic outlook, it lowered the policy target range down to zero."
 Financial stresses in the banking sector are a factor that my colleagues and I are closely watching as we determine the appropriate stance of monetary policy  going forward .

Let me end by noting that some have argued that the Fed’s tightening of monetary policy was significantly responsible for the failures and stress in the banking system.
" Let me state unequivocally:  The Fed ’s job is to use monetary policy to achieve its dual mandate, and right now that means raising rates to fight inflation."
 I do not support altering the stance of monetary policy over worries of ineffectual management at a few banks.
" We will continue to pursue our monetary policy goals, which ultimately support a healthy financial system ."
