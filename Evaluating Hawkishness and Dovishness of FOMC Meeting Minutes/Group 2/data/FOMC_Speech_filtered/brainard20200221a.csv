"EST February 21, 2020         Monetary Policy Strategies and Tools When Inflation and Interest Rates Are Low   Comment s on Monetary Policy in  the Next Recession ?, a report by Stephen Cecchetti, Michael Feroli, Anil Kashyap, Catherine Mann,  and Kim Schoenholtz     Remarks by  Lael Brainard   Member   Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at the  2020 U.S. Monetary Policy Forum , sponsored by  the Initiative on Global Markets  at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business   New York, New York         February 21, 2020   I want to thank Anil Kashyap and the Initiative on Global Markets for inviting  me, along with my colleague Raphael Bostic , to comment on this year’s U.S. Monetary Policy Forum report  by a distinguished set of authors.1  This year’s report  addresses the challenges that monetary policy is likely to encounter in the next downturn."
 This topic is under a ctive review by  the Federal Reserve and our peers in many other economies .2 Looking Back  The report  explores the important question of  whether the new monetary policy tools are likely to be sufficiently powerful in the next downturn.
" The  report  assesses  how unconventional tools —including forward guidance, balance sheet policies, negative nominal interest rates, yield curve control, and exchange rate policies —have performed over the past few decades."

" This approach adds to what we have learned from  earlier papers that have examined the performance of unconventional policy tools with respect to individual components of financial conditions —most nota bly, longterm sovereign yields, but also mortgage rates , equities, exchange rates, and corporate debt spreads.3  Empirically assessing the question in the report is not only important , but also challenging, as the report  readily  acknowledges."

"3), “Participants further observed that such inflation risks —along with several of the other per ceived risks of providing substantial accommodation through nontraditional policy tools, including possible adverse implications for financial stability —had not been realized."
" Looking Ahead  The current generation of central bankers faces a different core challenge than  the last generation, with substantially smaller scope for cutting interest rates to buffer the economy and inflation that is low and relatively unresponsive  to resource utilization ."
"With trend inflation running below the  symmetric 2 percent objective, there is a risk that inflation expectations have slipped."
" With price inflation showing little sensitivity to resource utiliz ation, policy may  have to remain accommodative for a long time to achieve 2 percent inflation following a period of undershooting."
" W ith the equilibrium interest rate very low, the F ederal O pen M arket C ommittee can cut the federal funds  rate by only  - 5 - about half as much as it has done historically to buffer the economy from recession."
" Consequently, the policy rate is likely to be constrained by the lower bound more frequently, likely at times when inflation is below target and unemployment is elevated."
" The likelihood that the policy  rate will be stuck at the lower bound more frequently risks eroding expected inflation and actual inflation, which could  further compress the room to cut nominal interest rates  in a downward spiral ."
" Equally important, we should adopt a strategy that successfully achieves maxi mum employment and average inflation outcomes of 2 percent over time."
 The lessons from the crisis  would argue for  an approach that com mits to maintain policy at the lower bound until full  employment and target  inflation are achieved .
This forward guidance  could be  reinforced by interest rate caps on short -term Treasury securities over the same horizon.
"  Forward guidance that commits to refrain from lifting the  policy rate from  its lower bound until full employment and 2 percent inflation are achieved is  vital to  ensure                                                  6 See Lael Brainard (2019), “Federal Reserve Review of Monet ary Policy Strategy, Tools, and Communications:  Some Preliminary Views,” speech delivered at the presentation of the 2019 William F."
" - 6 - achievement of  our dual -mandate goals  with compressed conventional policy space .7  To strengthen the  credibility  of the forward guidance , interest rate  caps c ould be implemented in tandem as a commitment mechanism."
" Based on its assessment of how long i t is likely to take to achi eve full employment and target inflation, the Committee would commit to capping rates out the yield curve for a period consistent with its expectation for the duration of the outcome -based forward guidance."
  One important benefit is that this approach would smoothly move to capping interest rates on the short -tomedium segment of the yield curve  once the policy rate moves to the lower bound and avoid the risk of delays or uncertainty that could be associated with asset purchases regarding the  scale and timeframe .
 The interest rate  caps  would transmit additional accommodation through the longer rates that are re levant for households and businesses in a manner that is  more akin to conventional policy and more continuous than quantitative asset purchases.
 Setting the horizon on the interest rate caps to reinforce forward guidance on the policy rate would augment the credibility of the yield curve caps and thereby diminish concerns about an openended balance sheet commitment.

" - 7 - target inflation and full  employment are achieved , and the caps expire, any  short -tomedium- term Treasury  securities that were acquired under the program would roll off organically, unwinding the policy smoothly and predictably."
" This approach sh ould avoid some of the tantrum dyna mics that have led to premature steepening of the yield curve in several  jurisdictions.8 Today’s  lowinflation, low interest rate environment requires not only new  recession -fighting tools but also a new strategy to address the persistent undershooting of the inflation target—and the risk to inflation expectations —well before a downturn."
"Various strategies  have been proposed that  seek to make up for  past inflation  deviations from target.9  To be successful, formal makeup str ategies , such as an averageinflation-targeting rule,  require that market participants, households, and businesses understand  the policy in advance and find it credible ."
" While formal averageinflation -targeting rules have some attractive properties in theory,  they could be difficult to c ommunicate and implement in practice due to time -inconsistency problems as well as uncertainty about underlying economic parameters.10   I prefer flexible  inflation averaging  that would aim to achieve inflation outcomes that average 2 percent over time."
" Flexible inflation averaging  would imply supporting                                                  8 For unusuall y severe recessions, such  as the financial crisis, such an approach could be augmented with purchases of 10year Treasury securities to provide further accommodation at the long end of the yield curve."

  - 8 - inflation a bit above 2 percent for some time  to compensate for the inflation shortfall over previous  years  and anchor inflation expectations at 2 percent .
" Flexible inflation averaging w ould bring some of t he benefits of a formal averageinflation -targeting rule, but it could be  more robust and simpler to communicate  and implement ."
" Following several  years when inflation has remained  in the range of 11/2 to 2 percent, the Committee c ould target inflation  outcomes in a range of 2 to 21/2 percent for a period  to achieve inflation outcomes of 2 percent , on average , overall."
"  By committing to achieve inflation outcomes that average 2 percent over time, the Committee would make clear in advance that it would  accommodate rather than offset modest upward pressures to inflation in what could be described as a process of opportunistic reflation.11  This approach will help move  inflation expectations back to our 2 percent objective, which is  critical to preserve co nventional policy space."
"It is important to emphasize that for monetary policy to be effective, it will be key for policymakers to communicate their strategy  clearly in advance to the public , to act early and decisively,  and to commit to providing the requ isite accommodation until  full employment and target inflation are sustainably achieved ."
 This was one of the important conclusions of this y ear’s U.S. Monetary Policy Forum  report .
"Fiscal Policy  Even with a revamped monetary policy strategy and expanded t ools, there  are risks."

" - 9 - ability of monetary policy to support the economy in a downturn through the traditional mechanism of pushing down longterm rates.12  Moreover, the equilibrium interest rate or, possibly,  inflation expectations could be lower than most current estimate s, with the implication that unconventional policies would need to compensate for a larger  reduct ion in the conventional policy buffer.13   Accordingly, in addition to a forceful response from monetary policy, robust  countercyclical fiscal policy is vital."
" The reduced conventional monetary policy buffer  makes the importance of fiscal support during a downturn even greater than it has been in the past, and  the case for fiscal support is especially compelling in the context of very low longterm interest rates."
" Not only is fiscal policy more vital when monetary policy is constrained by the lower bound, but research suggests it is also more powerful.14   Wher eas m onetary policy is powerful but blunt , fiscal policy can be more  targeted in its effects ."
" This  is especially important today, when a large share of American households have low liquid savings and are particularly vulnerable to periods of unemployment or underemployment."
" Just as monetary policymakers are actively                                                  12  See, for example, the minutes of the October 2019 Federal Open Market Committee meeting (p."
"4) :  “In addition, some participants noted that the effectiveness of these tools might be diminished in the future, as longer -term interest rates have declined to  very low levels and would likely be even lower following an adverse shock that could lead to the resumption of large -scale asset purchases; as a result, there might be limited scope for balance sheet tools to provide accommodation.”  (Available on the Boa rd’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20191030.pdf )."

 T he new normal  of low interest rates and inflation  also ha s implications for th e interplay between financial stability and monetary policy.
" In the decades when the Phillips curve was steeper, inflation tended to rise as the economy heated up, which would prompt the Committee to raise interest rates to restrictive levels."
" T hese interest rate increases would have the effect of tightening financial conditions more broadly, thereby naturally damping f inancial imbalances as the expansion extends."
"  With trend inflation persistently below target and a flat Phillips curve, not only is the policy rate expected  be low for long due to the decline in the neutral rate, but the policy rate  may also remain below the neutral rate for longer in order to move  inflation back to target sustainably."
" The expectation of a long period of accommodative monetary policy and low rates , during a period with sustained high rates of resource ut ilization, is conducive to risktaking , providing incentives to reach for  yield and tak e on additional debt."
" To the extent that the combination of a low neutral rate, a flat Phillips curve, and low underlying inflation may lead financial imbalances to become more tightly linked to the business cycle, it is important  to use tools other than monetary policy to temper the financial cycle."
" In today’s new normal , a combination of strengthened structural safeguards along with countercyclical macroprudential tools is important to  enabl e monetary policy to stay focused on achieving maximum employment and target  - 11 - inflation .15  The countercyclical capital buffer , which was  not available before  the crisis, is particularly  well  designed to address financial imbalances over  the cycle."
" To be fully effective, proactive use of an expanded toolkit needs to be coupled with a new strategy that achieves average inflation outcomes of 2 percent along with maximum employment over time."
