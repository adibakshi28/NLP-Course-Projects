"For release on delivery  8:00 p.m. EST (5:00 p.m. PST)  January 1 9, 2017         The Economic Outlook and the Conduct of Monetary Policy     Remarks by   Janet L."
"Yellen   Chair   Board of  Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at  Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research   Stanford University   Stanford , California       January 1 9, 2017  It is a privilege to be here today to discuss how the Federal Reserve is conducting monetary policy to promote a healthy economy."
"  In my remarks today , I will review the considerable progress the economy has made toward  the attainment of the two objectives that the Congress has assigned to the Federal Reserve-- maximum employment and price stability."
"  The upshot is t hat labor utilization is close to its estimated  longer -run normal level , and we are closing in on our 2 percent inflation objective ."
 I will then discuss the prospects for adjusting monetary policy in the manner needed to sustain a strong job market while maintaining low and stable inflation.
" In 2016, job gains averaged about 180,000 per month, well above the pace of 75,00 0 to 125,000 per month that is  probably  consistent with keeping the - 2 -  unemployment rate  stable over the longer  run.1  The unemployment rate is now close to estimates of its longer -run normal level , and other m easures of labor utilizati on have improved appreciably."
" As shown in f igure 1, a broad er measure of labor underutilization --the U -6 measure, which includes not only the unemployed but also people working part  time who would like full -time employment and those  who would like a job but are not actively looking --has retraced nearly all of the steep  runup that occurred as a result of  the recession.2  Other indicators also support the view that the labor market has largely recovered from the  severe downturn t hat occurred in the wake of the financial crisis."
" Of course,  both the labor force participation rate and the employmentto-population ratio are still much lower t han they were a decade ago."
" But the cyclical element in these declines looks to have largely disappeared, and what is left seems to mostly reflect the aging of the population and other secular trends.3  Based on this array of labor market indicators , I judge  labor utilization  to be reasonably close to its normal longer -run level  while also recognizing that  estimates of                                                            1 The sustainable longer -run pace of payroll employment growth depends on a number of a factors, such as the growth rate of the working -age population, trend movements in labor force participation, and the prevalence of self -employment and multiple job hold ings, so it cannot be predicted with precision."
" - 3 -  the sustainable level s of the une mployment rate  and the employment -topopulation ratio are inherently imprecise.4   In the coming months, I expect some further strengthening in labor m arket conditi ons as the economy continues to expand at a mod erate pace-- a view that is shared by most of my colleagues  on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) .5  Overall economic growth has been  driven by consumer spending, which has been bolstered  by substantial gains in household income and wealth ."
" As we l ook to broader trends, gross domestic product ( GDP ) growth has been restrained in recent years by a variety of forces  depressing both supply and demand, including slow  labor force  and productivity growth, weak growth  abroad , and lingering headwinds from the financial crisis ."
" Although I am cautiously optimistic that some of these forces will abate over time, I anticipate that  they  will continue to restrain overall growth  over the medium term , likely hold ing down the level of interest rates consistent with stable labor market conditions."
"  Turning to inflation , we are now much closer to the FOMC’s  2 percent objective than we were just a ye ar ago."
" Moreover, core PCE inflation --a better indicator  of the underlying inflation trend --picked up 1/4 percentage point , to a little over 11/2 percent."
 T his rise in inflation was anticipated and largely represent s a fading of the effects of  earlier  declines in energy prices and the prices of nonenergy import s.
" In addition, slack in labor and product markets  is no longer pla cing downward pressure on inflation , in contrast to the situation only a few years ago when the unemployment rate was still quite elevated."
" Barring future major swings in oil prices and the foreign exchange value of the dollar , inflation is likely to move up t o 2 percent over the next couple of  years , aided by a strong labor market."
"  In light of the progress  that has been achieved toward our  employment and inflation objectives  and the Committee’s assessment of the outlook, the FOMC raised the target range for the federal funds rate at its December meeting  by 25 basis points , to between 50 and 75 basis points."
" The Committee judge s, however, that the stance of monetary policy remains  modestly accommodative , and so policy  should support some further strengthening  in labor market conditions  and thus t he return of inflation to our 2 percent goal ."
" Maintaining S ustainable G rowth in a C ontext of P rice S tability  With the unemployment rate near its longer -run normal level and likely to move a bit lower  this year, a natural question is whether monetary policy has fallen behind the curve ."
" Most importantly, although core inflation is rising gradually from a low level, this increase mainly reflects the waning of the effects of earlier movements in the dolla r, not upward pressure from resource utilization ."
"Of course, even if the labor market is not overheated  currently , one might  worry that overheating could rapidly emerge  as labor market conditions strengthen further , causing inflation to surge."
" First, the pace of labor market improvement has slowed appreciably  in the past couple of years :  For example, average payroll gains moderated from 2 50,000 per month in 2014 to 180,000 last year , and the unemployment rate  declined 13/4 percentage points cumulatively over                                                            6 An exception to this pattern is the Atlanta Fed’s Wage Growth Tracker (WGT), which does show a noticea ble acceleration in hourly wages as self -reported in the Current Population Survey."
"- 6 -  2014 and 2015, compared with only 1/4 percentage  point last year.7  Second, economic growth more broadly seems unlikely to pick up markedly in the near term given the ongoing restraint from weak foreign d emand and other factors that I mentioned, particularly in an env ironment in which monetary policy  is likely to become gradually less accommodative."
" Finally , figure 4 illustrates the relationship over the past several decades between labor market pressures  and core inflation."
" Note that d uring  periods when the unemployment rate fell  below the C ongressional B udget O ffice’s estimate of its normal long -run level , shown by  the yellow shaded regions , core inflation , the solid red line, rose little , if at all."
" W aiting too long to remove accommodation could cause inflation expectations to be gin ratchet ing up, driving actual inflation higher and making it harder to control ."
" The combination of persistently low interest rates and strong labor market conditions could lead to undesirable increases in leverage and other financial imbalances , although such risks would likely take time to emerge .9  Finally,                                                            7 Many other labor market indicators also improved more slowly in 2016 relative to the pace seen in the prior two years, including the U -6 measure of labor utilization, the rates of job openings, hiring and quits, survey readings on net hiri ng plans and the difficulty of filling vacancies, and the average duration of unemployment."
" However, improvements in labor market conditions along this dimension arguably reflect an increase in potential output, and so they are probably not a source of inflationary pressures."
" 8 During the late 1960s through the 1970s, however, inflation did rise noticeably whenever the unemployment rate moved below its longer -run normal level, primarily because the Federal Reserve did not adequately check persistent m ovements in inflation by tightening monetary policy, thereby allowing inflation expectations to drift."
 This experience illustrates the importance of keeping inflation expectations anchored through systematic policy actions.
" 9 The Federal Reserve closely m onitors a wide range of indicators of financial stability , which currently provide little evidence of significant increases in leverage or rapid growth in credit."
" However, some asset - 7 -  waiting too long to tighte n policy could require the FOMC to eventually raise interest rates rapidly, which could risk disrupt ing financial markets  and pushing the economy into recession."
" For these reasons, I consider it prudent to adjust the stance of monetary policy gradually over time --a strategy that should improve the prospects that the economy will achieve sustainable growth with the labor market operating at full employment and inflation running at about 2 percent ."
" To sustain a strong job market with inflation at our 2 percent objective, policy must gradually shift toward  a neutral stance, where “neutral” is defined as a level of the federal funds rate that is neither expansionary nor contractionary when the economy is operating near its potential."
" The FOMC  also evaluates  forecasts from a range of economic models, assessments of key risks to the outlook, and detailed analyses of h ow different monetary policy strategies would affect projected outcomes  and risks ."
- 8 -  strategies routinely considered by the Committee are the recommendations of a variety of simple monetary policy rules.
" In addition, FOMC participants prepare individual projections on a quarterly basis of the most likely paths of key macroeconomic variables under their own assessments of “appropriate monetary policy ,” together with their estimates of the normal longer -run values of th e federal funds rate, the unemployment rate, and GDP growth.10  Armed with this wealth of information, the Committee as a whole then decides on the most appropriate policy action to adopt at each of its meetings ."
" As I noted, the Committee routinely reviews policy recommendations from  a variety of benchmark rules , and I believe that the ir prescriptions can be helpful in providing broad guidance about how the federal funds rate should be adjusted over time in response to movements in real activity and inflation."
" 11 The FOMC’s procedures share many of the features of forecast targeting , an approach to monetary policy making advocated by Svensson (2005) , among others."
" Consider  first the well -known Taylor rule , which embodies key principles of good monetary policy ."
 Should inflation be defined using the latest noisy quarterly reading  on headline PCE inflation or a measure intended to smooth through trans itory price movements ?
"  The Taylor rule is often  implemented by assuming that the real , or inflation -adjusted , value of the long errun neutral interest rate --which I will call R* for                                                            12 Formally, the rule originally published by Taylor (1993) can be written as 𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡=𝑅𝑅∗+𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡+0.5(𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡−𝜋𝜋∗)+0.5𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡, where R is the federal funds rate, R* is the level of the real federal funds rate that on average is expected to be consistent with sustaining maximum employment and stable inflation  in the longer run, π is current inflation, π* is the central bank’s inflation objective (2 percent, in the case of the  Federal Reserve), and Y  is the output gap, defined as the difference between the current level of real GDP and what it would be if the economy was operating at maximum employment."
"  Importantly, the rule embodies t hree key principles that central banks tak e into account when setting policy to stabilize inflation and the overall economy."
" First, a persistent movement in inflation requires a more than onefor-one response of the policy rate to stabilize inflation."
" Second, monetary policy should raise real in terest rates above their normal longer -run level when ever inflation is above its desired level and resource utilization is higher than normal, and lower them when the opposite holds."
" For inflation, we can use the 12month ch ange in core PCE prices , a measure of the current underlying  rate of inflation ."
" And the output gap can be reasonably approximated as  twice the difference between the estimated  longerrun normal rate of unemployment and the actual unemployment rate.13  The dashed  red line  in figure 5 shows the result ing recommendations for policy over the medium term, based on the medians of the unemployment  and inflation projections submitted by FOMC participants  in December  but assuming --in contrast to the median of participants’ December assessments --that  R* equals 2 percent ."
" As illustrated by the lefthand panel of f igure 6, since 2000, both FOMC participants and respondents to the Blue Chip survey  have mark edly reduced their projections of the level of real short -term interest rates expected to prevail in the longer run."
" Presumably, these revisions were made in response to accumulating evidence that lower real interest rates than  those seen on average  in the past  would be needed permanently to keep the economy operating on an even keel ."
" In addition, the right -hand panel shows considerable changes over time in estimates of the normal longer -run rate of                                                            13 Historically, percent d eviations of real GDP from statistical estimates of its long -run trend are roughly twice as large on average as deviations of the unemployment rate from its estimated long -run value --a relationship known as Okun’s l aw."
"   - 11 -  unemployment, with corresponding implications for estimates of the economy’s productive potential  and the output gap."
" Such revisions would imply shifts in the level of the Taylor rule’s prescriptions by a s much as 1 -1/4 percentage points , holding other factors constant.14  Clearly, s ensible implementation of policy rules requires adjustments to take such changes into account , as a failure to do so would result in poor monetary policy  decisions and poor economic outcomes.15 Figure 7 illustrates the policy implications of alternative revised assessment s of the longer -run neutral real r ate of interest."
 The problem is that the rule ignore s the likelihood that i t will likely take many years before the forces now restraining                                                            14 Additional complications  arise in the measurement of economic slack because the difference between the unemployment rate and its estimated normal level is not always a complete gauge of overall labor utilization.
" Such was the case in the current expansion until recently because the labor force participation rate was unusually low and involuntary part -time employment unusually high,  given the level of the unemployment rate."
"   15 If monetary policy persistently followed the prescriptions of a Taylor rule that assumed that R* was 2 percent when it was in fact 1 percent, then employment would run persistently below its  maximum sustainable level and inflation would run persistently below 2 percent."
" Under such circumstances, inflation expectations might begin to fall, creating a risk of deflation."
" Because overall growth has been quite moderate over the past few years despite an  accommodative stance of monetary policy, some recent e stimates of the current  value of the neutral real federal funds rate stand close to zero.16  If the neutral rate were to remain quite low over the medium term, as would be expected if the global economy does not materially strengthen and productivity growth remain s anemic, then the appropriate setting for  R* in the Taylor rule would arguably be  zero , yielding a yet lower path for the federal funds rate , as shown by the  longdashed red line."
" For example,  simple rules ignore  such important fa ctors  as fiscal policy, tren ds affecting global growth, structural  developments influencing  the supply of credit , and overall financial conditions ."
" The downward pressure on long erterm interest rates that the Fed’s asset holding s exert is  expected to diminish over time --a development that amounts                                                            16 For example, see Holston, Laubach , and Williams (2016)."
  - 13 -  to a “passive” removal of monetary policy accommodation.
" But if the economy  instead began  to overheat, threaten ing to push inflation to an undesirably high level, the FOMC would have ample scope to re spond through tighter monetary policy."
" This rule differs from the Taylor rule by being twice as responsive to movements in resource                                                            17 Based on estimates generated using the term -structure model developed by Li and Wei (2013) and the procedure discussed in Ihrig and others (2012) and extended by Engen, Laubach, and Reifschneider (2015), the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities and agency mortgage -backed securities continue to put considerable downward pressure on longer -term interest rates ."
" Based on the estimated co -movement of short -term and long -term interest rates , such a change in longer -term yields would be similar to that which, on average, has historically accompanied two 25 basis point hikes in the federal funds rate."
"  18 For example, prescriptions from seven different rules, calculated using forecasts of economic activity and inflation from different sources, are regularly posted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland at https://www.clevelandfed.org/our -research/indicators -anddata/simple -monetary -policy -rules.aspx."
" Because participants  on average a nticipate a modest undershooting of the unemployment rate below its estimated longer -run level, the balanced -approach rule calls for a slightly faster  pace of tightening over the next several years than the Taylor rule ."
" As its name implies , this rule does not prescribe a particular level of the federal funds rate at a given time  but rather how the existing rate  should change from quarter to quarter based on two gap s--the difference between inflation and its desired level  as well as the difference between the unemployment rate and its longer -run normal level.20  In contrast to the other two rules, th e change rule does not take a stand on the value of the longer -run neutral level of the real federal funds rate,  thus avoiding  a potential source of error."
" Because both gaps are relatively modest at the moment  and are projected to remain so,  the change rule calls for fairly gradual adjustments in  the stance of monetary policy  over the next few years given the current outlook."
" (See note 12 for details.)  As noted by Taylor (1999), research suggests that this rule may do a better job than the Taylor rule in stabilizing real activity and inflation."
" 20 The change rule is 𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡=𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡−1+1.2(𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡−2)+2.0(𝑈𝑈∗−𝑈𝑈𝑡𝑡), where R is the federal funds rate, π is four -quarter rate of core PCE inflation, U*  is the projected longer -run unemployment rate, and U  is the current unemployment rate."
" Nevertheless , the three benchmarks I have described --the Taylor rule, the balanced -approach rule, and the change rule, appropriately calibrated --have historically provided useful guidance about appropriate adjustments in the general direction  of monetary policy over time."
" This guidance is illustr ated by figure  9, which compares the path of the federal funds rate since 2000 with the prescriptions of the three rules, based on the actual rates of inflation  and unemployment observed at each point in time, along with contemporaneous Blue Chip projectio ns of the longerrun unemployment rate and R*."
" In addition, all three rules signaled that monetary policy needed to provide more stimulus during the recession and the subsequent recovery than could be provided by keeping short -term interest rates near zero."
" For this reason, the Committee turned to asset purchases to help make up for the shortfall  by putting additional downward pressure on long erterm interest rates ."
" As discussed by Reifschneider and Williams (2000), Werning (2012), and Woodford (2012), this type of lower -forlonger guidance can help compensate for the constraint on monetary policy created by the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates."
" Consistent with this advice, the FOMC suspended its asset purchase program in mid2014 and began raising the federal funds rate in late 2015.22   To sum up, simple policy rules can serve as useful benchmarks to help assess how monetary policy should be adjusted over time."
 Conclusion  My remarks have focused on the policy trajectory that the Committee now considers likely to be appropriate to sustain the economic expansion while keeping inflation close to our 2 percent  goal.
" For example, productivity growth i s a key determinant of the neutral rate , and while most forecasters                                                             22 For a closer look at the FOMC’s policy actions in 2016 and their relationship  to previous forecasts and subsequent changes in economic conditions , see Nechio and Rudebusch (2016)."
" - 17 -  expect productivity growth to pick up from its recent unusually slow pace, the timing of such a pickup is highly uncertain."
" Indeed, there is little consensus among researchers about the causes of the recent slowdown in productivity growth that  has occurred  both at home and abroad.23  The strength of global growth will also have an  important bearing on the neutral rate through both trade and financial channels , and here , too, t he scope for surprises is considerable."
" At this point, however, the size, timing , and  composition of such changes remain uncertain.24  However, as this discussion highlights, the course of monetary policy over the next few years will depend on many different factors, of which fiscal policy is just one."
"                                                            23 To sample some of the different views about the sources of the recent slowdown in productivity growth and the prospects for faster growth in the future , see Gordon (2016), Fernald and Wang ( 2015), Brynjolfsson and McAfee (2014) , and Decker and others (2016, forthcoming)."
