" For example, Hayek’s analysis has proved valuable in the development of standard microeconomics, since his contribution deepened economists’ understanding of the working of the price system and promoted further investigation of the question of how decentralized information is transmitted by markets.18  Hayek’s emphasis on prices as processors of information has also had applications to international trade theory.19  And in macroeconomics and monetary theory, Milton Friedman’s Nobel lec ture, published in 1977, cited Hayek’s 1945 paper when arguing that, because it disrupted the signals arising from relative -price movements, inflation both lowered the efficiency of the economy and led output to deviate from its natural  (or full -employment ) level.20  Hayek likened the price mechanism to a “system of telecommunications,” and Friedman’s description of inflation as a form of “static” interrupting price signals was in keeping with this analogy.21 Hayek’s ideas on prices influenced Joseph Stiglitz  in his analysis of markets with asymmetric information and Roger Myerson’s insights on mechanism design theory."
"527), and, for Friedman’s use of the analogy between inflation and static, see Friedman and Friedman (1980, pp."
" Specifically, Stiglitz  argued that incomplete information could lead to unnecessarily high unemployment and other undesirable outcomes that could be improved on by government intervention."
" E conomic conditions are currently very close to meeting our —that is , the FOMC’s —dual -manda te objectives of maximum sustainable employment and price stability."
" The unemployment rate has been running near a 50 -year low, and the propor tion of the population currently employed is close to its highest level in a decade ."
" Although the pace of job gains has slowed this year, we expected some deceleration  because of how low the unemployment rate has fallen ."
   A strong job market and high employment have in turn supported economic growth.
" Personal consumption expenditures (PCE)  grew 2 -1/2 percent over the p ast four quarters, a healthy pace by  historical standards and a major contributor to overall growth since consumption represents over two -thirds  of economic activity."
" Because the labor  - 12 - market remains tight, I expect wage growth to pick up, which would then in turn underpin further strength in consumption and overall  growth."
"  For the other half of our mandate, inflation as measured by the PCE index was 1."
"3 percent over the 12 months ending in September, while core  PCE inflation , which excludes increases in the prices of  food and energy, was 1.7 percent."
" While these readings are below our 2 percent inflation objective, they are fairly close, and my assessment is that inflation will inch  toward our objective in the coming months ."
 I am heartened  by a recent pickup in labor  productivity growth.
 A  notable development of the post -crisis period has been the abysmal pace of labor productivity growth.
" After averaging about a 21/4 percent pace in the two decades leading up to the crisis, labor productivity growth has been closer to 1 percent , on average, since 2011."
" Although the quarterly data are volatile, I have been encouraged by a pickup in labor  productivity in the first half of this year, when it grew at a 3 percent annual rate ."
" Further out, I admit to being a bit of technoenthusiast , and I see the potential for many emerging technologies, including 5G communications, artificial intelligence and machine learning, and 3D printing, to further boost productivity growth in the coming years."
" Having established my optimism, I will now circle back to some more worrying signs in the recent data that suggest some headwinds are holding back growth."
 One prominent factor weighing on a relatively robust domestic economy has been weak growth among our trading partners.
 The International Monetary Fund projects that global  - 13 - economic growth in 2019 will be the slowest since the financial crisis.
" Partly as a consequence of weak foreign growth, U.S. exports have been flat over the past year."
" It is likely that some of the weakness in capital spending is a result of elevated uncertainty, for foreign growth generally but also specifically for trade developments."
" Overall, with these policy adjustments, I believe that the economy will remain in a good place, with the labor market remaining strong and inflation stay ing close to our 2 percent objective."
" We s ee the current stance of monetary policy as likely to remain appropriate as long as incoming information about the economy continues to be  broadly consistent with our outlook of moderate economic growth, a strong labor market, and inflation near our symmet ric 2 percent objective."
