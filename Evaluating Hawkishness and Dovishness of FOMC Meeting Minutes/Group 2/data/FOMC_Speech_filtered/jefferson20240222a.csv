 Recent Monetary Policy Cycles in Retrospect     Remarks by   Philip N.
" Also, I will review past monetary policy cycles and discuss what lessons we may learn from them ."
" Aggregate Economic Activity  Growth in r eal gross domestic product in 2023 came in much higher than expected by most professional forecasters, buoyed by strength in consumer spending."
 These developments lead me to expect slower growth in spending and output in 2024.
"   - 2 - The Labor Market  The imbalance between labor demand and labor supply has narrowed,  as labor demand has cooled while labor supply has improved."
" There is evidence of cooling labor demand, such as the decline in job openings by 3 million from their peak in March 2022."
" At the same time, layoffs have remained very low, and the pace of payroll employment gains remains strong, with nonfarm payroll monthly job gains in the past three months averaging 289,000."
" The unemployment rate in January was 3.7 percent, a level that is still near historical lows."
 The fact that the unemployment rate and layoffs have remained low in the U.S. economy over the past year amid disinflation suggests that there is a path to restoring price stability without the kind of substantial increase in unemployment that has often accom panied significant tightening cycles.
  The Inflation Outlook  Inflation made clear progress over 2023 toward the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) 2 percent inflation objective.
" I believe that this progress reflects both the unwinding of pandemic -related supply and demand distortions in the economy as well as r estrictive monetary policy, which has cooled strong demand and given the supply side of the economy time to catch up."
 That disappointing CPI reading highlights that the disinflation process is likely to be bumpy.
" The January data notwithstanding, the slowing in core inflation has been especially pronounced in recent months, as the 3 - and 6 -month changes in core PCE prices through January, at 2.5 percent and 2.4 percent, respectively, clearly remain below the 12 -month change shown in figure 2."
" Inflation in core services, both in its housing component and nonhousing services, has also slowed, but not as much."
" A Longer -Term Perspective on Monetary Policy Cycles  Next, I would like to highlight key aspects of past monetary policy cycles and what lessons we may learn from these past experiences."
"     1 The start date of 1989 is motivated by the fact that this was the earliest cycle in which the FOMC was viewed as considering monetary policy actions in terms of discrete 25 basis point, 50 basis point, etc., rate moves in the federal funds rate target and,  as such, is more comparable to today."
" The second and third columns summarize economic conditions as described in official  accounts of monetary policy released at the time, such as FOMC statements, minutes of Committee meetings, and the Federal Reserve Board’s semiannual Monetary Policy Report ."
" The table also records inflation at the time of the peak rate as measured by the 12month percent change in headline and core PCE price indexes.2   My main inference is that most of the time, in five out of the six episodes, the peak rate is reached once inflation is contained, albeit in some cases with risks still present."
" There is only one exception in this sample, the March 1989 to May 1989 peak -rate episode, when inflation was elevated —noted in the first row of the table."
" The easing cycle following this particular peak -rate episode began as core and headline PCE inflation were starting to come down from an elevated level, as illustrated in figure  4.3  This figure shows headline and core inflation two years before and after the start date of each of the six easing cycles."
" The red line, which corresponds to the March 1989 peak -rate episode, stands out, with core PCE inflation at 4 percent at the beginn ing of the easing cycle, while all the other easing cycles show core PCE inflation at about 2 percent at commencement."
" Our situation today is closer to the norm during these episodes than to the exception, as PCE inflation is closer to 2 percent than to 4  percent."
"  2 The PCE inflation numbers in table 1 are revised data , which means the data that policymakers were reviewing at the time —the so -called real -time data —could have been different."
" In addition, for some of these cycles, policymakers focused on CPI inflation more than PCE inflation."
"Also, note that while the table frequently references inflation relative to a 2 percent rate, it was only for the last peak -rate episode for which the FOMC had established a 2 percent rate of inflation to be most consistent over the longer run with its price -stability goal, per its fi rst “Statement on Longer -run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy” adopted in January 2012."
" When studying monetary policy cycles, it is important to recognize the often -multistage nature of cycles and, because of this, table 2 distinguishes between the reasons underpinning the start of the easing cycle, listed in column 2, and those underpinning subsequent easings, listed in column 3."
 The initial 75 basis points of easing in this cycle were a result of downside risks to the U.S. economy due to weaker global growth an d high trade uncertainties.
" First, most easing cycles start because of concern about slowing economic growth."
" In table 2, the one exception is the easing cycle that started in July 1995 and is associated with what Alan Blinder (2023) has lab eled a “perfect soft landing” example.4  That particular easing cycle started predominantly because of reduced inflation concerns."
" All the other easing cycles started because either there was a concern about slowing economic growth, or, in one case, because there was a concern about slowing ec onomic growth and there were reduced inflation concerns."
   - 6 - The second fact that stands out is that history is replete with events that complicate monetary policy decisions.
" Specifically, because these events contributed to the contraction of economic activity, policymakers may have accelerated policy easing."
"  The lesson that policymakers need to remain vigilant and nimble is further illustrated in figure 5, which shows the unemployment rate around the start of each easing cycle."
" As can be seen from this chart, in some easing cycles —for example, the easing cycles that began in January 2001, shown in blue, and September 2007, shown in green —the unemployment rate ramps up quickly, shortly after the easing cycle began."
"  In the easing cycle that began in January 2001, moderating growth over the second half of 2000 gave way abruptly to sluggish growth around the end of the year."
" Economic weakness spread and intensified over the first half of 2001 and —as shown by the blue l ine—a year after the easing cycle began, the unemployment rate had increased just short of 2 percentage points."
" As the green line in the chart shows, the unemployment rate was around 41/2 percent at the start of the 2007 –08 easing cycle —having remained broadly stable around that level in 2006 —but then rapidly rose to 6 percent within a year of the first easing."
 My motivation for discussing these two episodes is to highlight how quickly economic activity can weaken.
  Another reason why policymakers need to watch all available information and be nimble in their decisionmaking is that developments concerning inflation can likewise change rapidly.
 The invasion compounded the effects of post -pandemic supply constraints on inflation.
" In addition, we always need to keep in mind the danger of easing too much in response to improvements in the inflation picture."
" Former Fed Chair Paul Volcker stressed this danger in a 1981 speech, when he pointed to 1967 as a year when monetary policy eased in response to concerns about slowing economic growth and reduced inflation concerns, yet inflation subsequently turned back up."
" Finally, another observation from reviewing past episodes is that careful easing in the July 1995 easing cycle allowed the FOMC to assess incoming data and other  - 8 - information to make sure that inflation was under control."
"  Lessons for Current Monetary Policy  With the knowledge of past experiences in hand, let me say a few words about the current monetary policy cycle and the extent to which future policy is likely to resemble, if at all, past experiences."
"  Our strong actions have moved our policy rate well into restrictive territory, and our restrictive stance of monetary policy is putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation."
" In the absence of unanticipated exogenous shocks, polic ymakers can weigh multiple factors, including keeping policy restrictive enough to tamp down a possible resurgence of inflation due to the strength of aggregate demand or easing sooner to avoid an undue increase in unemployment."
" First, as I mentioned at the beginning, consumer spending could be even more resilient than I currently expect it to be, which could cause progress on inflation to stall."
" Second, employment could weaken as the factors supporting economic growth fade."
"  I remain cautiously optimistic about our progress on inflation, and  I will be reviewing the totality of incoming data in assessing the economic outlook and the risks surrounding the outlook and in judging the appropriate future course of monetary policy."
