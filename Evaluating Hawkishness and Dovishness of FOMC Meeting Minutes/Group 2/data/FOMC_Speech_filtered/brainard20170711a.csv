"For release on delivery  12:30 p.m. EDT  July 11, 2017         Cross -Border Spillovers of  Balance Sheet Normalization     Remarks by   Lael Brainard   Member   Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at  “Normalizing Central Banks’ Balance Sheets:  What Is the New Normal?”  a conference sponsored by  Columbia University ’s School of International and Public Affairs  and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York   New York, New York         July 11, 2017    When the central banks in many advanced economies embarked on unconventional monetary polic y, it raised concerns that  there might be differences in the cross -border transmission of unconventional relative to conventional monetary policy.1  These concerns were sufficient to warrant a special Gro up of Seven ( G7) statement  in 2013 establishing ground r ules to address possible exchange rate effects  of the changing composition of monetary policy .2  Today the world confronts similar questions in reverse."
" And for the first time in many years, the global economy is experiencing synchronous growth, and authorities in the e uro a rea and the U nited Kingdom  are beginning to discuss the time when the need for monetary accommodation will diminish ."
" 2 The new commitment stated: “ We reaffirm that our fiscal and monetary policies have been and will remain oriented towards meeting our respective domestic objectives using domestic instruments, and that we will no t target exchange rates."
" The corresponding Group of Twenty statement included the new commitment:  “ We will not target our exchange rates for competitive purposes.”  See Group of Twenty (2013), “ Communiqué of Meeting of G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors ,” Febru ary 16, paragraph 5, www.g20.utoronto.ca/2013/20130216- finance.html ."
" Shrinking the balance sheet and raising the policy rate can both contribute to achieving the domestic goals of monetary policy, but it is an open question whether alternative normalization approaches might have materially different  implications for the composition of demand and for cross -border spillovers , including through exchange rates and other financial channels."
"  Before discussing the cross -border effects of normalizat ion, it  is worth  noting that the two tools for removing accommodation-- raising policy rates and reducing central bank balance sheets --appear to affect domestic output and inflation in a qualitatively similar way ."
" In the case of the Federal Reserve, the F ederal O pen M arket C ommittee (FOMC)  decided to delay balance sheet normalization until the federal funds rate had reached a high enough level to enable it to be cut materially if economic conditions deteriorate, thus guarding against the risk of returning to the e ffective l ower bound (ELB)  in an environment with a historically low neutral interest rate .3  The greater familiarity and past experience with the federal funds rate also weighed in favor of this instrument                                                  3 See, for example, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (201 5), “Federal Reserve Issues FOMC Statement,”  press release, December 16 , https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20151216a.htm ; and Brainard (2015 b)."
" Separately, for those central banks that, unlike the Federal Reserve, moved to negative interest rates, there may be special consid erations associated with raising policy rates back into positive territory."
" As a result, similar to the domestic effects, w hile the international spillovers of conventional and unconventional monetary policy may operate broadly similar ly, the relative magnitude of the different channels may be sufficiently different that, on net, the two policy s trategies have distinct effects."
" For example, as will be discussed at greater length shortly, the two strategies may have very different implications for the exchange rate."
" Moreover , as was evident with the European Central Bank’s ( ECB ) asset purchases i n late 2014 and early 2015, and as we have seen again in reverse in recent weeks, in addition to the standard demand and exchange rate channels, expected or actual asset  - 4 - purchases may have spillovers to foreign financial conditions --by lowering term premiu ms and the associated  longer -term foreign bond yields --that are greater than conventional monetary policy ."
"   To explore  possibl e difference s, it is useful to c ompa re two different approaches to policy normalization, each of which is designed to have ident ical effects on aggregate domestic activity and thus, at least in the long run, on inflation."
" Where the two approaches have entirely equivalent effects, the central bank could freely substitute bet ween them  without chang ing the composition of home demand, and  net exports , the exchange rate, and f oreign output would also be unaffected."
"  Conversely, under different assumptions about the transmission channels of monetary policy, alternative approaches  to normalization can have quite different implications for foreign economies ."
" Most prominently, the exchange rate may be more sensitive to the path of short term rates than to balance sheet adjustments, as some research suggests.4  Although several paper s using an event study approach find on balance little disparity in the exchange rate sensitivity to shortterm compared to long4 See, for instance, Stavrakeva  and Tang (2016) ."
"  - 5 - term interest rates, this lack of empirical consensus may simply reflect the difficulty of disentangling changes in short -term and longer -term interest rates, which are highly correlated .5 Indeed,  the greater sensitivity of exchange rates to expected short -term interest rates than to term premiums  was a key  rationale  behind the Operation Twist strategy in  the early 1960s.6  Under Operation Twist, the Federal Reserve and the Treasury made largescale purchases of longer -term Treasury securities to drive down yields and stimulate the economy, which was suffering from an unemployment rate of nearly 7 percent."
 This policy was combined with a modest increase in short -term interest rates intended to alleviat e the capital outflow pressures that threatened the sustainability of the Bretton Woods global monetary system.
" Ultimately, this policy mix did succeed in reducing long -term interest rates, and also contributed to a reduction in private capital outflows that relieved pressure on U.S. international reserves, at least for a time."
  Let’s turn to a simulation of a highly stylized model to  explore  how a greater  sensitivity of the exchange rate to conventional policy relative to  balance sheet actions can make a difference in terms of cross -border transmission.
" In particular, let’s assume  a 100basis -point rise in long -term yields coming from the conventional channel of higher polic y rates has  doubl e the effect on the exchange rate as a 100 basis point rise in yields coming from higher term premiums.7  If a large country, which is already at potential , experiences a favorable domestic demand shock, it  would need to tighten monetary                                                  5 See Glick and Leduc (2015),  Ferrari, Kearns, and Schrimpf (2016) , and Swanson (2017); Swanson attempts to identify separately the effects of forward guidance and asset purchases ."
" If the central bank  chooses to use the short -term interest rate as its active policy tool, and keeps its balance sheet on hold, the current and expected path of short -term interest rates rises, putting upward pressure on longterm bond yields and caus ing the real exchange rate to appreciate."
 The stronger currency coupled with some  initial expansion of domestic demand in turn cause  a deterioration in real net exports.
" In the case where the foreign economy is pinned at the effective lower bound, the increase in net exports will provide a welcome boost to aggregate demand."
" I f the same amount of policy tightening in the country experiencing a positive demand shock is achieved exclusively through a  reduc tion in the  balance sheet , while keeping the  policy rate unchanged , the exchange rate would appreciate to a smaller degree, reflecting the lower assumed sensitivity of the exchange rate to the term premium than to policy rates."
 Net exports  would decline by less --reflecting both the smaller exchange rate appreciation and the smaller rise in domestic demand --and similarly this wou ld result in smaller cross -border spillovers to foreign GDP.
" The foreign economy will experience less exchange rate depreciation, and so less of a boost to net exports."
" So far, we have considered the case of central banks with freely floating exchange rates and well -anchored inflation expectation s."
 What about central banks with managed exchange rates or  weakly  anchored inflation expectations?
" To keep the analysis simple, let’s assume a foreign central bank aims to completely stabilize its exchange rate vis -àvis a core country."
 Let’s again cons ider circumstances in which the core country experiences a positive demand shock that calls for policy tightening.
" The tightening in the core country will compel the country that is fixing its exchange rate to tighten policy in sync  and the core country’s currency will rise more against its trading partners with conventional tightening, leading to greater effective appreciation of the pegging country’s currency as well ."
" Although the pegging economy will benefit somewhat from the stronger demand of the core country,  - 8 - that benefit is likely to be outweighed by the adverse effects of a tightening of domestic monetary policy when domestic conditions would not otherwise call for it."
" In particular, let’s consider the case when two large countries, which are assumed identical for the sake of simplicity, experience the same positive shock to domestic demand."
" Un der these assumptions, if both economies were to choose the same normalization strategy --putting primary reliance on either the balance sheet or short -term interest rates --the implications for the exchange rate and net exports are the same:  In both cases,  the exchange rate between the two countries does not change, and neither do net exports between the countries."
" Each central bank would adjust interest rates by the same amount --enough to offset the stimulus from the demand shock --and with interest differ entials unchanged, there would be no pressure on the exchange rate between them  to move.9  Of course, if there are other economies in the rest of the world that do not experience the same shock, the choice of normalization strategy does matter , similar to the analysis of spillovers from                                                   8 See Brainard (2015a)."
" If one country faces a larger aggregate demand shock than the other, then the situation b ecomes more like the onecountry case we examined before, the policy adjustments lead to spillovers of different magnitudes, and the offset will be partial."
" The country that relies on the policy rate to make the adjustment experiences an ap preciation in the exchange rate, a deterioration in net exports and some expansion of domestic demand, while the country that chooses to rely solely on the balance sheet for tightening experiences a depreciation of its exchange rate and an increase in net exports."
" Thus, while both countries achieve their domestic stabilization objectives, whether the requisite policy tightening occurs through increases in policy rates or reductions in the balance sheet matters for the composition of demand, the external balance, and the exchange rate."
    I highlighted at the outset the commitment adopted by many leading nations to set monetary policy to achieve domestic objectives such that the exchange rate would not be a primary consideration in the setting of monetary policy.
" In the case that balance -sheet and conventional monetary policies have equivalent effects on both domestic spending and the exchange rate, this common principle is straightforward."
" But if the cross -border spillovers of reductions in the balance sheet and increases in the policy rate are not equivalent, the sequencing of policy rate and balance sheet normalization could have important implications for the exchange rate and external balance."
" If the data continue to confirm a strong labor market and firming economic activity, I believe it would be appropriate  soon to commence the gradual and predictable process of allowing the  balance sheet  to run off."
"  Once that process begins, I will want to assess  the inflation process closely before making a  determination on further adjustments to the federal funds  rate in light of the  - 11 - recent softness in core PCE  (personal consumption expenditures) inflation."
" I will want to monitor  inflation  developments careful ly, and to move cautiously on further increases in  the federal funds  rate, so  as to help guide inflation back up around our symmetric target."
" As I just discussed, the pace and timing of how central banks around the world proceed with norm alization, and the importance of balance sheet policy relative to changes in short term rates in these normalization plans , could have important implications for exchange rates and financial conditions globally ."
 The model is specified in real terms under the implicit assumption that inflation is constant (so that real and nominal variables move by the same amount).
" Moreover, the model  abstracts from any financial linkages between the two economies, including the possibility that monetary policy actions in one country could directly affect yields in the other (e.g., through portfolio balance channels), though such effects are clearly important empirically."
"  - 13 - Home and foreign absorption depend on long –term interest rates according  to the following expressions:  ()() ,,∗∗∗ ∗++−=++−=u ru rc du rurc dσσ Here rc is the component of long –term interest rates that is driven by conventional monetary policy, ru  is the component of long –term interest rates that is driven by unconventional monetary policy, and u is an exogenous  aggregate demand shock (with autocorrelation given by ρ)."
" These interest rate components are assumed to have identical effects on aggregate demand, with the parame ter σ determining the sensitivity of aggregate demand to either component (n..b., interest rates are expressed in percentage points deviation from the steady state)."
" Net exports are assumed to fall if the real exchange rate ( e) rises/appreciates, and also if domestic demand is higher relative to foreign demand (since this boost imports)."
" Thus:  ()∗−−−= dd e nx αη  where η is the elasticity of net exports with respect  to the exchange rate, and α is the elasticity of net exports to the differential between home and foreign absorption."
 The real exchange rate is expressed in percent deviation from the steady state.
" The exchange rate is determined according to an interest rate parity condition which  implies that the exchange rate appreciates  when domestic interest rates are higher  - 14 - than foreign interest rates, with elasticities ( φc and φu ) that can differ depending on whether interest rate movements are driven by conventional or unconventional polic y: ()().∗ ∗−+−= ruru rcrc eu c φ φ  The model is closed by specifying the behavior of the monetary authority."
" We assume that the monetary authority  can adjust either the interest rate associated with conventional policy ( rc), or the interest rate linked to balance sheet actions (ru), or both, to affect output (its goal variable)."
" The conventional feedback rule is thus:  ,,∗∗∗==y rcy rcccγγ whereas the unconventional  feedback rule is:  .∗∗∗==y ruy ruuuγγ The system above contains 10 equations in 10 endogenous  variables ( y, y*, d, d*, nx, e , rc, rc*, ru, ru*), as well two shocks, u and u*, that can move GDP, its components, exchange rates , and interest rates."
 Simulation Results  Figures 1 and 2 show  the results of simulating the model under alternative assumptions about the shocks and monetary policy reaction.
" In each case, the economy starts in steady state with all variables at zero and experiences a demand shock in period 1 that dies out with an autocorrelation ρ of 0.95."
 Home Demand Shock  Figure 1 illustrates the case of a favorable  demand shock in the home country.
" The higher policy rate path (that is, higher rc ) causes the long -term interest rate (panel A) to rise, which in turn induces the real exchange rate to appreciate (panel B)."
" At the end of the period shown, domestic demand has nearly returned to baseline, while net export s are just a bit below baseline --consistent with Home country ’s GDP remaining at baseline (panel E)."
" Because foreign monetary policy rates is assumed to remain on hold, foreign GDP (panel F) rises by the imp rovement in its net exports (that is , by the mirror image of panel D, given that foreign domestic absorption is unchanged)."
" The dashed lines illustrate t he case of a favorable demand shock in the Home country when the central bank opts to tighten exclusively through reducing its balance sheet (again, by enough to keep output  at potential--see column 3 of Table 1)."
" Longterm interest rates (panel A) rise i n response, but the exchange rate appreciates less in this case (panel B), reflecting the lower assumed sensitivity of the exchange rate to unconventional monetary policy actions (φu < φc )."
 Net ex ports decline (panel D) by less --reflecting both the smaller exchange rate appreciation and a smaller rise in absorption (panel C) --which translates into less of a boost to foreign GDP (panel F) than when the home country adjusts through conventional policy.
" Common Demand Shock , Asymmetric Policy Tightening across Countries  Figure 2 shows a simulation in which the demand shock is assumed to be common across countries ( u = u* )."
" As policy rates rise in the home country (panel A) and the exchange rate is more sensitive to policy rates than to the balance sheet, the home country's exchange rate (panel B) appreciates, while its net exports (panel D) decline."
" Although GDP remains at baseline in each country (panels E and F) given our assumption that monetary policy keeps output at potential (which is unchanged), the alternative policy normalization choices clearly have important ef fects --even under a common shock-- on both exchange rates and the composition of demand in each country."
" In particular, because exchange rates in the foreign country are less sensitive to balance sheet than to interest rate policy, the foreign central bank must enact a relatively larger interest rate tightenin g in order to keep its GDP at potential."
