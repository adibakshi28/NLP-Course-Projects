"For release on delivery  8:30 a.m. EDT  May 8 , 2019          “Fed Listens ” in Richmond:  How Does Monetary Policy Affect Your Community?"
"Today’s community listening session is part of a series  called  “Fed Listens.”  T he Federal Reserve is undertaking  a review to make sure we are carrying out the monetary policy goals assigned to us by the Congress in the most effective way we can .2  In conducting this review , we are reaching out to communities around the country in sessions like this to understand how you are experiencing the economy  day to day ."
Two  Goals  So what are the monetary policy goals the Congress assigned us?
  Congress has assigned  the Federal Reserve to use monetary policy to achieve maximum employment and price stability.
 B y price stability we  mean moderate and stable inflation.

   - 2 - policy —has announced that our  goal is to keep inflation around 2 percent  over time .
 The maximum employment part of our dual mandate is straightforward:  The Congress has directed us to achieve the highest level of employment—and thus the lowest level of unemployment —that is consistent w ith price  stability.
" While the Congress has s pecified the goals for monetary policy and a set of tools or authorities to pursue  them, it has allowed  the FOMC to determine how to best go about achieving those goals."
"  Reviewing How We Conduct Monetary  Policy  Last year,  core inflation was very close to our goal."
 And the unemployment rate is at a 50 -year low.
"We also want to make sure that the way w e are setting monetary policy is keeping up with the way the economy is changing , which I have been refer ring to as the “new normal.”3  There are a few key features of that new normal ."
" For exampl e, interest rates have stayed  very low in recent years  not only in the United States , but also in many other advanced economies ."
" For a variety of reasons, it seems likely  that equilibrium  interest rates will remain low in the future."
 Low interest rates present a challenge for the traditional ways of conduct ing monetary policy.
" That  is especially true in recessions  when, in the past, t he Federal Reserve has typically cut interest rates by 4 to 5 percentage points  in order  to suppor t household spending and business investment."
" But w hen equilibrium interest rates are low, we have less room to cut interest rates  and thus less                                                  3 Lael Brainard, “ The ""New Normal"" and What It Means for Monetary Policy ,” remarks at  the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, Chicago, Illinois, September 12, 2016."
" For example, following the most recent  recession  in 2008 and 2009, we kept interest rates as low as the Committee thought they could go, which was  close to  zero , for many years."
   Another big change in the economy is that inflation doesn’t move as much with economic activity and employment as it has in the past .
" I n many ways, the flatter Phillips curve has advantages:  It means that the labor market can strengthen a lot and pull many workers that may have been sidelined back into productive employment without an acceleration in inflation, unlike what we saw  in the 1960s and 1970s."
" Similarly, inflation doesn’t fall as much in recessions."
  But t here is an important risk with today’s low sensitivity of inflation to slack :  It makes it more  difficult to boost inflation to our objective of  2 percent on a sustainable basis.
" And, as we know from other countries, if inflation consistently falls short of the central bank’s objective, lower inflation tends to get embedded in people’s expectations ."
" Expectations that inflation will remain low in turn can create a self -fulfil ling dynamic with actual inflation , making it even more difficult for the central bank to boost inflation."
" And because inflation is reflected in nominal interest rates,  that, in turn, can also reduce the amount of policy space the central bank has available to prevent the economy from slipping into recession."
"   - 4 - Some Issues to Explore  Given the new normal of low equilibrium  interest rates and low sensitivity of inflation to slack, it is prudent to assess how well various approaches worked both here and around the world, with a view  to identifying  the best ways to  promote the goals the Congress assigned to us ."
  One of thos e is the idea that the Federal Reserve should explicitly promise to “make up” for the fact that interest rates can’t be cut as much as during past  recession s.
" The Federal Reserve could hold interest rates lower after a  recession is over, perhaps by promis ing not to raise interest rates until inflation or the unemployment rate have reached a particular level."
"   A related idea is average inflation targeting , meaning the Fed would aim to achieve its inflation objective on average over a long er period of time —perhaps over the business cycle."
" So if inflation fell short during a recession, the Federal  Reserve would aim at inflation above target during the recovery and expansion."
" This approach would also have aspects of a makeup policy, as policy would likely be kept easier —that is, more accommodative —than otherwise during the period where inflation is above target."
 There is some skepticism that a central bank would in fact prove able to support above -target inflation over a sustained period without becoming concerned that inflation might accelerate and inflation expectations might rise too high.
"  - 5 - Another idea I would like to hear more about involves targ eting the yield on specific securities so that  once the short -term interest rates we traditionally target have hit zero, we might turn to targeting slightly longer -term interest rates —initially one -year interest rates, for example, and if more stimulus is needed, perhaps moving out the curve to two -year  rates ."
" Under this policy, the Federal Reserve would stand ready to use its balance sheet to hit the targeted interest rate, but unlike the asset purchases that were undertaken in the recent recession , there would be no specific commitments with regard  to purchases of  Treasury securities."
" And, in addition to presentations  from prominent outside experts , we made sure to add panels to hear from community organizations , training institutions, and other groups that can give us insights on how monetary policy  is affecting Main Street."
 What about inflation and pricing power?
