" In doing so , I will look at changes in th e community banking sector at a national level and will also look at geographic patterns of community bank growth and decline."
" Breaking the universe of community banks down into subgroups based on size, we can see that the decline in community bank numbers is far from uniform.2  The number of banks with between $1 billion and $10 billion in assets has doubled since 1995                                                  1 The FDIC definition of community banks can be found at https://www.fdic.gov/regulations/resources/cbi/report/CBSI -1.pdf  2 All asset sizes are converted to 2005 dollars, so the changes in size distribution cannot be attributed to inflation."
"I should note that the growth in this “large community bank” category is greater than that among banks with more than $10 billion in assets, in terms of both the number of banks added to the category and the percentage growth rate."
 Some of this decline reflects the growth of small banks (often de novo banks) out of the smallest size range into larger size categories due to either organic growth or acquisition of another bank.
  Research by Adams and  Gramlich that was presented at the 2014 c ommunity banking conference and subsequently published in the Review of Industrial Organization considers the underlying causes of the virtual absence of new bank formation since 2009.4  This research suggests that  slow economic growth and low interest rates in the postcrisis environment can explain  about 75 percent  of the decline in new bank charters .
" We also considered whether economic conditions such as the unemployment rate , the median household income , the number of business establishments, or changes in any of these measures might be useful in predicting which markets would lose community banks over time."
" Fourth, although the lack of entry may be due in part to increased regulatory burden, much of it can be explained by very low interest rates and a post -crisis  expansion that has been slower than usual."
" - 10 - I think the key question for policym akers is whether the recent acceleration in the rate of decline in the number of small banks is primarily a structural change attributable to increasing economies of scale-- or, perhaps more accurately, diseconomies of very small scale --or whether recent ef forts by the FDIC and others to encourage more chartering of new banks, combined with a return to higher interest rates and stronger economic growth, will mitigate the decline in numbers."
" The Federal Reserve and the Conference of State Bank Supervisors began this conference three years ago in order to stimulate research on community banks, with the goal of improving our understanding of their condition and their important contributions to economic growth and pr osperity."
"In addition to fulfilling this commitment, the Federal Reserve and other federal banking agenc ies have launched a review to identify banking  - 11 - regulations that are outdated, unnecessary, or unduly burdensome, as required by the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act."
