 I will turn for a moment to monetary policy.

"  Today, inflation is well below our 2 percent longer -term objective , as measured by prices for personal consumption expenditures."
" And although the unemployment rate has declined notably since its peak in 2010, it remains well above our estimate of a longer -run, more normal level."
"  I expect that inflation will return gradually to our 2 percent objective, and that we will continue to make progress in reducing unemployment."

" Homebuilders are responding to this price signal with rising housing starts, which will support job growth."
" Together, these and other factors give grounds to hope for the kind of self -reinforcing cycle of economic growth that we have been waiting to see."
"  And as our economy has gradua lly improved, it has become possible, and appropriate, for the Federal Reserve to provide clearer guidance on the path of monetary policy."
" In all likelihood, this path will involve continued support from accommodative monetary policy for quite some time."
