" In 2022, we chose the theme for this year’s conference based on events very much on the minds of central bankers: “Global Supply Shocks, Trade Frictions , and Inflation.” Global and sectoral supply shocks over the past few years have had significant effects on trade, economic activity , and inflation, and they figured prominently in monetary policymaking."

" We have sessions on inflation, of course, and supply chain disruptions, and optimal monetary policy,  and the important topic of uncertainty, which central bankers to some extent always face."
