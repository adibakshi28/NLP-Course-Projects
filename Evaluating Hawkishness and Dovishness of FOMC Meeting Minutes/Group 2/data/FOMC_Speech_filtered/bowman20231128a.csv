"MST)  November 28, 2023          Reflections on the Economy and Monetary Policy     Remarks by  Michelle  W."
"Bowman   Member   Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at the  Utah Bankers Association and Salt Lake City Chamber  Banker and Business Leader Breakfast   Salt Lake City, Utah         November 28, 2023    It is a pleasure to join you this morning in Salt Lake City for the Utah Banker and Business Leader Br eakfast.1  I find great value in engaging with and learning from the experiences and perspectives  of those who are directly engaged in the economy —businesses and consumers, and those  who suppor t economic activity by providing access to financial services through the broader financial system."
 I will also consider the monetary policy actions taken by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) in response to these developments and conclude by highlighting several uncertainties surrounding the economic outlook and how they affect my views about appropriate monetary policy going forward.
" Prominent among these uncertainties are whether supply -side improvements will continue to reduce inflationary pressures; the exten t to which the demand for goods, services, and labor will come into better balance with supply given the current setting of monetary policy; and the level at which the federal funds rate will be consistent with the FOMC’s inflation and maximum -employment g oals in the longer  run."
"  - 2 - The Post –Financial Crisis Economy and Monetary Policy  Five years ago, monetary policymakers faced a much different set of challenges than those we face today."
" At that time, one of the primary concerns of the FOMC was that infla tion had consistently been running slightly below  the Committee’s 2 percent inflation target, despite years of accommodative monetary policy following the 2007 –08 financial crisis and subsequent recession."
" More broadly, many central banks around the world  were grappling with the prospect of structurally lower interest rates due to a variety of factors including demographic changes and higher savings rates, lower potential output and productivity growth, and greater investor demand for safe assets like Trea sury securities."
"  One central topic of discussion during FOMC meetings in 2018 and 2019, my first year as a Governor and permanent voting member of the FOMC, was how monetary policy strategies and tools could best achieve the Committee’s dual mandate of p rice stability and maximum employment in a world of structurally low interest rates and disinflationary forces that kept inflation persistently  under the Committee’s 2 percent target."
" Relatedly , there was an ongoing concern that the federal funds rate, th e FOMC’s key policy rate, was too close to the “zero lower bound,” which would limit the Committee’s ability to respond effectively to an adverse shock by lowering interest rates."
" In 2018, the FOMC was nearing the end of a gradual monetary policy tightening cycle that had begun in late 2015."
" At the time the FOMC had been slowly tightening monetary poli cy, it had the benefit of a strong labor market, a steadily expanding  - 3 - economy, and inflation near 2 percent."
" The FOMC maintained this range until the second half of 2019, whe n the Committee reduced the federal funds rate by a total of 75 basis points in response to moderating economic growth and inflation and global economic uncertainties related to expectations of lower U.S. growth.2  Although the underlying issues were quit e different, there were similarities to the issues we face today."
" These impacts will affect how we think about monetary policy going forward, but let’s put the event and response into better context."
" In October 2019, in response to a  brief  period of stress  in short -term funding markets , the FOMC began to expand the size of the Fed’s securities holdings from a level of just over $3.5 trillion to attain a level of ample reserves to the banking system in line with growth in the economy a nd banking sector."
"   - 4 - The Pandemic Policy Response and Economic Recovery  Widespread economic lockdowns a nd social isolation , combined with other pandemic effects , caused the swiftest and deepest contraction in employment and economic activity since the Great Depression."
"These purchases were initially designed to support the smooth functi oning of security markets to support the flow of credit to businesses  and households and , later, to provide additional monetary policy accommodation to support economic activity and labor markets.4  Central banks in other countries and jurisdictions also implemented accommodative monetary policy to support their economies during the early phases of the pandemic."
"  The innovative approaches adopted by many American businesses —including shifting to online sales and complying with social -distancing requirements to meet government operating requirements —the excess savings, and the newly introduced medical treatmen ts supported a sharp economic rebound in 2021 , with more than 5 percent real gross domestic product ( GDP ) growth in the first two quarters."
" Strong demand, early retirements, generous fiscal support, very low legal immigration, and a mismatch between avail able jobs and workers all contributed to a very tight labor market."
" The unusually rapid rebound in economic activity, the pandemic -driven shift in consumer spending toward goods, reduced manufacturing capacity in some sectors, and supply -chain vulnerabili ties led to crippling supply -chain bottlenecks in a number of areas."
" Eventually, given these supply –demand imbalances amid accommodative fiscal and monetary policies, inflation moved up to very high levels."
" By the second half of 2021, inflationary pressur es intensified and became more broad  based."
" Of the many  difficult issues the Committee faced at the time, one of the most important w as whether the inflationary pressures would be persistent or resolve as supply -side pressures eventually eased."
"   The June 2021 Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) showed the median FOMC participant expected annual personal consumption expenditures ( PCE) inflation to  - 6 - be 3.4 percent at the end of 2021 and to settle at 2.1 percent by the end of 2022.5  Private -sector forecasters expected slightly lower inflation of 2.9 percent at year -end 2021 and projected  it to be  2.3 percent by the end of 2022.6  With the benefit of hindsight, we know now that most forecasters, ourselves included, vastly misjudged the persistence of inflation at that time , with PCE inflation of 5.9 percent for both 2021 and 2022."
 This underscores the challenge we faced in discer ning which factors were driving inflation and how long those forces would persist.
" High Inflation and the Response of Monetary Policy  In the second half of 2021, it became clear that the FOMC’s monetary policy stance was too accommodative in the presence o f growing inflationary pressures and that the Committee needed to move toward a tighter policy stance.7  It seems likely to me that the experience of the years leading up to the pandemic, when inflation was persistently low, made it hard for forecasters t o foresee how quickly that could change."
" Of course, the inflation and labor  data did not accurately reflect the economic conditions  prevailing at the time  and were subsequently substantially revised ."
" Together , these factors likely also led to a delay in the removal of monetary policy accommodation in 2021.8  The  5 See the Summary of Economic Projections released following the June 2021 meeting of the Federa l Open Market Committee , which is available on the Board’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm ."
" 7 The median FOMC participant revised up 12 -month PCE inflation to 4.2 percent and 2.2 percent for the years 2021 and 2022 , respectively , in the  September 2021 SEP."
" 8 For example, both August and September 2021 employment reports suggested job growth at much lower levels than consensus forecast s and were subsequently sizably increased."
" Similarly, based on current data, PCE inflation for 2021 :Q3 to 2022 :Q2 are also revised higher."
  - 7 - monetary policy experience during the pandemic highlights how structural changes in the economy can be difficult to identify in real  time.
" And in May, the FOMC announced its plan to reduce the size of the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings —which then stood at around $8.5 trillion —starting in June and at a pace much faster than in the previous episode of balance sheet reduction.10  The FOMC also continued to increase the target range for the federal funds rate over the course of 2022 at a pace much faster than in previous tightening cycles, as it became clear that inflation was higher and more persistent than many forecasters had expected."
" Twelve -month total PCE inflation peaked  at 6.6 percent just before the June 2022 meeting, reflecting both high core inflation and higher energy and food prices, which were influenced by geopolitical conflicts."
" We have also seen significant progress on bringing inflation down, so far without impairing the strength of the labor mark et and economic activity."
"  Looking Ahead  At our most recent meeting , the FOMC voted to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at the current level and continue to run off the Fed’s securities holdings.11  Inflation readings have come in lower, with some of the improvement related to a continued easing of supply -side pressures."
" But the level of inflation remains high, with the most recent readings of 12 -month total and core PCE inflation at 3.4 percent and 3.7 percent , respectively ."
" The economy has remained strong as the FOMC has raised the federal funds rate, and recent data indicate  that economic activity accelerated in the third quarter , with real GDP growing at a 4.9 percent annual rate."
 The most recent employment report showed a continuation of healthy job gains.
" Labor force participation has improved over the past year, with a somewhat slower, but still strong, pace of job gains, a sign that labor market supply  and demand may be coming into better balance."
 But my baseline economic outlook continues to expect that we will need to increase the federal  funds rate further to keep policy sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to our 2 percent target in a timely way.
" However, monetary policy is not on a preset course, and I will continue to closely watch  11 See the October 2023 Federal Open Market Committ ee Statement, which is available on the Board’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm ."
 - 9 - the incoming data as I assess the implications for the economic outlook and the appropriate path of monetary policy.
   There are several uncertainties surrounding my baseline outlook that will influ ence my view of appropriate monetary policy going forward.
" First, much of the improvement in inflation over the past year has been due to supply -side improvements, such as improving supply chains, increases in labor force participation, and lower energy prices."
 It is unclear whether further supply -side improvements will continue to lower inflation.
" And while these investments have the potential to increase productive capacity, over the next few years they may also create strong demand for labor and equipment in areas without the necessary physical resources to support the development, which may increase inflationary pressures."
" In my view , there is also a risk that over the coming months higher energy prices could reverse some of the recent progress made by supply -side improvements to bring overall inflation down."
"  Second, over the past year , the number of workers in the labor force has increased from improved labor force participation and other factors , including recent growth in work visa issuance for some immigrants."
" At the same time, the average pace of job gains has slowed  somewhat  and vacancies have declined , a sign that labor supply and demand may be coming into better balance."
 There is a real risk that these learning losses will limit the productivity of the American workforce in coming years.
" Over time , American workers who experienced these education  disruptions may overcome the pandemic -era learning losses, but today, as young people leave education and transition into the work force, there is a risk that either the economy will experience lower long -term trend growth, or that the divide between thos e who suffered learning losses and those who did not results in vastly different economic and overall outcomes for this generation of American workers.12 The third of these uncertainties is the extent to which strong aggregate demand and the composition of  spending will continue and contribute to inflationary pressures going forward."
 There is also a risk to inflation from higher services consumption.
" With too few workers to fill the number of existing job openings, a continued increase in the demand for services may contribute to persistently  high core services inflation."
" Additionally, a lack of fiscal restraint could further contribute to inflationary pressures."
    Another uncertainty is the reaction of economic activity and inflation to the continuation of higher interest rates  and tighter financial conditions.
" We don’t yet know the full extent of the effects of tighter monetary policy and financial conditions on economic activity and inflation.13  There  are some signs of interest rate sensitivity for small business loans and c orporate debt, and slightly higher delinquencies for existing credit card accounts and auto loans, in comparison  to before the pandemic."
" However, the presence of cash buyers in the housing market has lowered some of the interest rate sensitivity in the ho using sector."
"  Further, many households continue to hold significant excess savings and are realizing ongoing savings from mortgages originated or refinanced when interest rates were low."
   13 The literature points to a wide range of estimates regarding the effects of higher interest rates on the economy.
" See, for example,  Ander Perez -Orive and Yannick Timmer (2023), “Distressed Firms and the Large Effects of Monetary Policy Tightenings,” FEDS Notes  (Washington:  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, June 23), https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds -notes/distressed -firms -andthe-large -effects -ofmonetary -policy -tightenings -20230623.html ; Nitish Sinha and Michael Smolyansky (2022), “How Sensitive Is the Economy to Large Interest Rate Increases?"
"-12 - In considering business investment and interest rate sensitivity, the evidence has been mixed.14  The most recent Richmond and Atlanta Federal Reserve CFO Survey suggests that roughly 40 percent of respondents have already pulled back on investment requiring financing at current interest rates.15  However, another 40 per cent say that they are not interest rate sensitive, their financing or borrowing is not influenced by rates, or they do not know the level at which the rate would become an impediment."
"    Finally, given all of the considerations I have just discussed , it is not yet clear whether the appropriate level of the federal funds rate will need to remain at a higher level than before the pandemic in order to effectively foster low and stable inflation and support full employment."
" In my view, given potential struct ural changes in the economy, such as higher demand for investment relative to saving, it is quite possible that the level of the federal funds rate consistent with low and stable inflation will be higher than before  the pandemic."
" Structurally higher interest rates might also lead to les s concern about the possible financial stability effects of reach -foryield behavior , as higher interest rates ease pressure on institutions like life insurance companies and pension funds that manage extended -duration liabilities."

" 15 See Zach Edwards and Daniel Weitz (2023), “How Are Interest Rates Impacting Spending?"
" - 13 - Conclusion  In conclusio n, I continue to see an unusually high level of uncertainty as I consider current economic conditions and my own views on the outlook for the economy and monetary policy."
 My colleagues and I will continue to make our monetary policy decisions at each meet ing based on the incoming data and the implications for the economic outlook.
 I remain willing to support raising the federal funds rate at a future meeting should the incoming data indicate that progress on inflation has stalled or is insufficient to bri ng inflation down to 2 percent in a timely way.
"  We should keep in mind the historical lessons and risks associated with prematurely declaring victory in the fight against inflation, including the risk that inflation may settle at a level above our 2 percent target without further policy tightening."
 Returning inflation to the FOMC’s 2 percent goal is necessary to achieve a sustainably strong labor market and an economy that works for everyone.
