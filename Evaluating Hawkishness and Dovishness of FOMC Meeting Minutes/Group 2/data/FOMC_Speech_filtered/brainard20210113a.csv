"        For release on delivery  1:00 p.m.  EST January 13, 2021          Full Employment in the New Monetary Policy Framework      Remarks by  Lael Brainard   Member   Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at   The Inaugural Mike McCracken Lecture on Full Employment   Sponsored by the Canadian Association for Business Economics (via webcast)         January  13, 2021       I want to thank the C anadian A ssociation for B usiness Economics for inviting me to join you today, particularly  president Bonnie Lemcke and past president Armine Yalnizyan ."
"   I am honored to deliver t he inaugural Mike McCracken Lecture on Full Employment .1  Widely known for his critical contributions  in bringing computer modeling to Canadian economic forecasting , Mike McCracken  is perhaps  best known for his tireless advocacy that “l ower unemployment remains the most important goal for the economy,”  which is particularly resonant for me , along with his emphasis on  think ing critically and expansively about full employment .2  A similar theme  was highlighted by community and labor representatives  as well as educators at our Fed Listens even ts, and it is now reflected in the Federal Reserve’s new monetary policy framework .3  Lifting the lives  of working people  is at the heart of  economic policymaking."
" The deep and disparate damage caused by the pandemic , coming just over a decade  after the financial crisis, underscores the vit al importance of full  employment , particularly for low - and moderate -income workers and those facing systemic challenges in the labor market ."
"2 In his 2012 Galbraith Lecture, Mike McCracken noted, “By ‘full employment,’ I mean that everyone who wants a job can find one that is acceptable in terms of compensation, safety, and other conditions of work.”  See Mike McCracken  (2015) , “The Search for Full Employment”  (Ottawa:  Informetrica Limited, January), paper originally presented at the John Kenneth Galbraith Prize in Economics  Lecture,  delivered in the Progressive Economics Forum session at the Canadian Economics Association meetings, held in Calgary, June 2012, https://progressive -economics.ca/wp -content/uploads/2007/06/McCrackenGalbraith -Lecture.pdf ."
"     - 2 - Monetary Policy Framework  Two years ago, the Federal Reserve beg an an in -depth review of its monetary policy framework.4  The design of our review process  incorporated feature s from the Bank of Canada’s quinquennial  renewal of its inflation -control framework agreement , such as input from stakeholders and the  focused research undertaken by  staff members , academics, and outside experts."
" Our review was prompted by changes in  key longrun features of the economy :  The recognition that price inflation is much less sensitive to labor market tightness than historica lly—that is,  a flat  Phillips curve ; that the equilibrium  interest rate is much lower  than in the past ; and that trend underlying inflation has moved  somewhat below 2 percent ."
" These developments reduce the amount we can cut interest rates to buffer the economy, weaken inflation expectations, and could lead to worse employment and inflation outcomes over time  if not addressed ."
"  In response, we have made  changes to monetary policy that can be expected to support fuller  and broader -based employment  than in earlier  recoveries, improving opportunities for workers who  have  faced structural challenges in the labor market.5  Where as our previous strategy had been to minimize deviations  from maximum                                                  4 See Jerome H."

"      - 3 - employment in either direction, monetary policy will now seek to eliminate shortfalls from maximum employment."
" In other words, t he new framework calls for policy to address employment when it falls short of its maximum  level , whereas the previous framework  called for policy to react when  employment was  judged to be  too high as well as too  low."
 The new monetary policy framework also eliminates the previous reference to a numerical estimate of the longer -run normal unemployment rate and instead define s the maximum level of employment as a broad -based and inclusive goa l for which a  wide range of indicators are relevant .
  Additional changes  address the persistence of below -target inflation and the decline in the equilibrium interest rate .
" Research and experience indicate that persistent low equilibrium interest rates increase the frequency and duration of periods when the policy rate is pinned close to zero, unemployment is elevated, and inflation is below target.6  As a result, actual inflation and inflation expectations will tend to be biased below the 2 percent targe t, further eroding policy space and exacerbating the effects of the lower bound, risking a downward spiral for actual and expected inflation."
" From the time of the Federal Open Market Committee’s ( FOMC) announcement of a 2 percent inflation objective in January 2012 through the most recent data in November, monthly readings of 12month personal consumption expenditure ( PCE) inflation have averaged 1.4 percent and have been below  2 percent in 95 out of  the 107 months."

"      - 4 - To address th e downward bias, the new framework adopts a flexible average inflation -targeting strategy (FAIT) that seeks to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time in order to ensure longer -term inflation expectations a re wel l anchored at 2 percent ."
" Under a FAIT  strategy, appropriate monetary policy aims to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some  time to make up for shortfalls during a period when it has been running persistently below 2 percent .7   These change s could have a beneficial effect  on the robustness of employment as well as the economy’s potential growth rate ."
" In current circumstances, where a strong labor market can be sustained without the emergence of high inflation, t he conventional  practice of reducing policy accommodation  preemptively when unemployment nears its estimated longer -run normal  rate is likely to lead to  an unwarranted loss of opportunity for many worker s.8  For instance, t he labor market healing that took place after the unemployment  rate reached the  5 percent median Summary of Economic Projections estimate of  the longer -run normal unemployment rate , from the fourth quarter of 2015 until the fourth quarter of 2019, included the entry of a further 31/2 million prime -age Americans int o the labor force, a movement of nearly 1 million people out of longterm unemployment, and opportunities for 2 million involuntary part -time workers to secure                                                  7 See Ben S."

"8 Twelve -month PCE inflation was only 1.6 percent in December 2019, when the unemployment rate was 3.5 percent, racial gaps in employment were at hi storical lows, and labor force participation had increased."
       - 5 - fulltime jobs.9  The gains  in employment  may have come sooner and been  greater  if the new monet ary policy framework had been in place throughout the previous recovery.
" This could, i n turn, boost activity  and increase potential growth by drawing individuals from groups facing structural challenges into more  productive employment .10  Research and experience suggest the groups that face the greatest structural challenges in the labor market are likely to be the first to experience layoffs during downturns and the last to experience employment gains during recoveries.11  At the October 2019 Fed Listens  event , Amanda  Cage , who now heads  the National Fund for Workforce Solutions , observed , “What we s ee is huge disparities in what unemployment looks like for neighborhoods .”12  She highlighted the challenges facing those  communitie s where unemployment remains at or above  15 percent even when unemployment fall s below 4 percent at the national level."
 11 Research finds that both unemployment rates and patterns of labor force entry and exit for Black and Hispanic workers are more cyclically sensitive than for White  workers.

"      - 6 - Recent re search i ndicates that  additional labor market tightening is especially beneficial  to disadvantaged groups when it occurs  in already  tight labor markets, compared with earlier in the labor market cycle.13  For example, t he gap between the Black and White unemployment rates fell to an all -time low of 2 percentage points in August 2019—well below its average of 6.3 percentage points.14  Outlook and Policy  Late last year, the Committee integrated the framework changes into its monetary policy."
" The September  2020 FOMC statement adopted outcome -based f orward guidance for the policy rate  tied to shortfalls from maximum employment and 2 percent average inflation , and the December  2020 FOMC statement adopted outcomebased forward guidance for asset purchases."
" Our monetary policy approach should support a stronger, broader -based recovery from the deep and disparate damage of COVID -19."
"  The guidance indicates that the Committee expects the policy rate to remain at the  lower bound  until  employment has  reached levels consistent with the Committee’ s assessments of maximum employment , and inflation has  risen to 2 percent and is  on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time."

"Roberts (2019), “Monetary Policy Strategies for a LowRate Environment, ” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2019009 (Washington:  Board of      - 7 - forward guidance  communicates how the policy rate will react to the evolution of inflation and employment ."
 It makes clear that  the timing of  liftoff will depend on realized progress toward maximum employment and 2 percent average inflation.
"  The FOMC statement notes that monetary policy will remain accommodative after liftoff in order to achieve “ inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time .”16  Even after economic conditions warrant liftoff, changes in the policy rate are likely to be only gradual to support the inflation makeup strategy and maximum employment ."
" The Survey of Market Participants  conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York indicates  a shift in expectations following the release of the new monetary policy framework.17  The median expected rate of unemployment at the time of liftoff moved down from 4.5 percent in the July s urvey, before the  release of the framewor k, to 4.0 percent in the Septem ber and subsequent  surveys , following the release of the new framework."
" Similarly , the median  level of 12month PCE inflation                                                  Governors of the Federal Reserve System, February), https://doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2019.009."
"     - 8 - anticipated at the time of liftoff  rose from  2 percent  in the July s urvey to 2.3 percent i n the September  survey and beyond, following the introduction of  FAIT .18   The forward guidance adopted in December  expands the  goals  of the asset purchase s beyond market functioning by establish ing qualitative outcome -based criteria tied to realized progress on our employment a nd inflation goals."
 The December guidance clarifies that the pandemic asset purchases  will continue at least at the curre nt pace until substantial further progress is made on our employment and inflation goals.
" In assessing  substantial further progress, I will be looking for sustained improvements in realized  and expected inflation and will examine  a range  of indicators  to assess shortfalls from maximum  employment ."
" Continued social distancing over the cold winter months  is likely to  generate a significant                                                  18 The shift in the median appears to reflect an upward shift in the distribution:  In the interquartile range  of values between the 25 th and 75 th percentiles, inflation of 2.2 percent moved from the top of the range in July to the bottom of the range in September."
" 19 Through muc h of the recovery, spending on durable goods far exceeded the rates of growth that had been observed before  the COVID -19 crisis."
" As a result, households may  curtail their purchases going forward in order to bring the stock of consumer durables back in line with long -run levels of demand."
" Additionally, state and local income and sales tax  and gaming and energyrelated revenues remain depressed , and the most recent payroll s report indicates that state and local governments are having difficulty sustain ing employment levels as the virus persists."
   Inflation remains very low ; core PCE inflation ran at 1.4 percent over the 12 months ending in Nov ember .
" Even though some of the survey -based measures of inflation expectations have picked up recently, they still remain close to the lower end of their historical ranges."
  Market -based measures of inflation compensation have also picked up.
" While disentangling inflation expectations  from  liquidity and term premi ums is imprecise,  staff models attribute a significant portion of the movement  in inflation compensation to an increase in expectations, bringing them up from the lows seen in March but still below their historical average s."
" Inflation may temporarily rise to or above 2 percent on a 12month basis in a few months  when the low March and April price readings from last year fall out of the 12month calculation, but it will be important to see sustained improvement  to meet our a verage inflation goal."
" Overall, payroll employment is still nearly 10 million jobs below its February level ."
" If we adjust the 6.7 percent headline unemployment rate for  the decline in participation  since Februa ry and the Bureau of Labor Statistics estimate of misclassification , the unemployment rate would be 10 percent, similar to the  peak following the G lobal Financial C risis."
" Federal Reserve staff analysis indicates that unemployment is likely above 20 percent for workers in the bottom wage quartile, while it has fallen below 5 percent for the top wage quartile.20  Black and Hispanic unemployment st ood at 9.9 percent and 9.3  percent, respectively, in December , whi le White  unemployment wa s 6.0 percent."
" Fortunately , fiscal support looks set to resume playing a vital role  in the form of  stimulus payments and extended unemployment benefits , particularly for the c ashconstrained households  that make up a significant fraction of the population."
 The unprecedented scale and composition of fiscal support ma de a vital difference in replacing lost income and supporting demand in the middle of last year and is expected to do so again  in the months ahead.

        - 11 - breadth of the  monetary policy response  through an expanded set of tools is support ing lower borrowing costs along the yield curve for households and businesses  as well as  better inflation and employment outcomes.
  We are strongly committed to achieving  our maximumemployment and average -inflation goals .
"  The economy is far away from our goals in terms of both employment and inflation, and even under an optimistic outlook, it will take time to achieve substantial  further progress."
" We remain far from our goals , with core PCE inflation only at 1."

"     - 12 - guidance will help keep borrowing costs  low along the yield curve  for households and businesses, improve inflation outcomes, and enable the labor market to heal, leading to a broader -based and stronger rec overy."
" T he strong support from monetary policy, together with fiscal stimulus , should turn the K -shaped recovery into a broad -based and inclusive recovery that delivers full  employment, as Mike McCracken would have wished ."
