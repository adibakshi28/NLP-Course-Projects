"For release on delivery  4:00 p.m. E ST November 14, 2014         Monetary Policy Accommodation, RiskTaking, and Spillovers      Remarks by   Jerome H."
" I will offer brief introductory thoughts and then discuss some recent research by Federal Reserve Board economists that has  bearing on these matters .1   The Federal Reserve’s monetary policy is motivated by the dual mandate, which calls upon us to achieve stable prices and maximum sustainable employment."
" Since the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve has pursued a highly accommodative monetary policy, which has had important effects on  asset prices and global investment flows."
" Overall, accommodative monetary policy seems to have provided significant support for U.S. growth."
" And, of course, a strong U.S. economy  contributes to strong growth around the globe, particularly in the emerging market economies ( EMEs )."
" By design, accommodative moneta ry policy --whether conventional or unconventional --supports economic activity in part by creat ing incentives for investors to take more risk."
 I now turn to some recent research  on whether there has been an increase in the riskiness of our investments  abroad and whether such increases might be traced to the current low -interest rate environment.
" Many studies of the pre -crisis period document the procyclical nature of bank lending and leverage, and the buildup of risktaking and  - 3 - leverage by banks.2  It is much harder to find evidence that low interest rates have led to increased post -crisis risk -taking by U.S. banks."
 Growth in overall lending by U.S. banks has been modest at best.
"  Recent research  by Board staff,  using a database of loans primarily to U.S. borrowers but also to some foreign borrowers, suggests that lenders have indeed originated an increased number of risky syndicated loans post -crisis, based on the assessed probability of default as reported to bank supervisors ( figure  1).3  Regression results confirm that the average probability of default is significantly inversely related to U.S. long -term interest rates."

"                                                  - 4 - foreign borrowers, shows a similar pattern of increased risky loan underwriting by international lenders, an increase that is also significantly inversely related to U.S. interest rates."
" Together, these results suggest a pot ential spillover from accommodative U.S. monetary policy through increased risktaking in syndicated loans globally, although preliminary results also indicate that investors still requir e extra return for this extra risk ."
  Another area in which to look f or links between low  interest rates and risk -taking is in cross -border securities purchases.
 T he role of low interest rates in advanced economies  in encouraging capital flows to EMEs  where returns are higher  has been a familiar theme .4  And r ecent  studies  have  found that asset prices in EMEs  do respond systematically to U .S.
"monetary policy shocks .5   For evidence of increased risk -taking in cross -border investment, let’s  look  at the composition of U.S. investors’ foreign bond portfolios ."
