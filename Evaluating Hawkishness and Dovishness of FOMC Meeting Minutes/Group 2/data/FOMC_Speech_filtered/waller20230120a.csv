 It has been close to  a year since the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) began tightening monetary policy.
 We began raising interest rates in March 2022 and shrinking our securities holdings in June in order to bring inflation down to our 2 percent target.1  Today I thought I would spend a few minutes tak ing stock of the year behind us and talking about what’s next.
"  A year ago , inflation was elevated and rapidly accelerating, and the Fed moved to quickly and dramatically  tighten monetary policy."
" Economic activity, meanwhile, has been holding up well."
" I expect such  slowing to continue in this quarter, which is both expected and desirable in our ongoing fight to lower inflation."
  The FOMC’s  goal in raising interest rates is to  dampen demand and economic activity  to support further reduc tions in inflation .
"  Meanwhile, the ISM survey for nonmanufacturing businesses, which had reported expansion since April of last year, 1 The FOMC c ommunicated its i ntentions f or some t ime before M arch, a nd this guidance e ffectively began monetary policy tightening before raising rates and beginning the tapering  of asset purchases that mo nth."
" This slowdown in services activity was widespread, affecting 11 of 17 sectors in the survey, with significant slowdowns in construction and real estate, two industries heavily affected by higher interest rates."
 This slowing in business activity i s consistent with t he FOMC’s goal of damp ing demand and reducing production so that it is in  better alignment with the productive capacity of the economy.
" The goal is not, I would emphasize, to halt economic activity, and so we will be watching these sectors closely to see how this moderation continues."
  Growth in consumer spending has also begun to slow.
" While that growth was surprisingly strong through most of the second half of 2022, nom inal personal consumption expenditures growth slowed to 0.1 percent in November, and retail sales fell 1 percent."
" While the latest readings of cons umer sentiment from the University of Michigan moved up some from historic lows, I continue to expect that last year’s decline in real incomes , along with higher borrowing costs, will moderate consumer spending this year and  help return inflation more promptly to the FOMC’s 2 percent target."
"  Job one is maintaining  the progress we are making in lowering inflation, and moderation in consumer spending will support that progress."
The slowing in output growth has occurred alongside the continuing strength of the labor market.
" Total nonfarm employment grew 223,000 in December, close to the average of 237,000 a month for the fourth quarter."
" That is down quite a bit from the monthly  increase of 539,000 in the first quarter of 2022 but still a solid growth rate, far above the number of new jobs needed to keep pace with population growth."
" Employment  - 3 - grew robustly in the leisure and health -care sectors, where labor shortages are reportedly  severe."
" The unemployment rate was 3.5 percent in December , matching the low reached before the pandemic, and the lowest in 53 years."
 But there are signs that demand for labor is moderating.
" Temporaryhelp employment, which has sometimes been a leading indicator for overall employment, has declined in recent months , but that decrease may be due at leas t in part to employers opting to hire fulltime workers in place of temps to help keep jobs filled."
" A robust labor market, despite modest economic growth, is a plus for workers and allows the Fed  to focus on lower ing inflation."
" It shows that jobs  and income can hold up to the effects of higher interest rates , help ing the FOMC  continue its efforts to lower inflation to our 2 percent goal by further tightening monetary policy."
" A potential downside of a tight labor market is if labor costs , which heavily influence inflation, grow so fast t hat they  slow progress toward the FOMC’s 2 percent objective."
 Wages and other measures of compensation accelerated as inflation surged in the second half of 2021 and wage growth remained high in 2022.
" But a s overall inflation has begun to moderate in recent months, so ha ve some measures of growth in wages and other compensation."
" For example, t he 12month increase in average hourly earnings hit a recent peak of 5.6 percent in March ( which is when the Fed began raising interest rates) and has been falling gradually and fairly steadily since then, reaching an annual ra te of 4.6 percent in December."
" These are encouraging signs, but we need to see continued impro vement across various measures of labor costs, because additional moderation is needed to bring inflation down to our 2 percent goal and because a significant  escalation in wage growth could drive up longer -range i nflation expectations ."
" Those longer -range expectations  have been fairly s table through this period of very high inflation, and we want it to stay that way because escalating expectations could drive inflation higher."
 Let me turn now to the outlook for inflation.
" Last week’s report on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) showed that inflation continued to moderate in December, which was very welcome news."
" First, I am going to spell out why this was such good news, and then I am goi ng to turn around and explain why I am still cautious about  the inflation outlook and supportive of continued monetary policy tightening."
"Overall headline inflation fell a tenth of a percent month over month in December, the first monthly drop since May 2020."
" The 12month change  in inflation peak ed at 9 percent i n June, and  has fallen every month since, t o 6.5 percent in December."
"   A big factor in  the monthly decline in headline inflation in December  was a significant drop in energy prices, which more than offset a n increase in food price s."
" The FOMC targets head line inflation because food and energy are considerable expenses for most people, but they are more volatile than other components of the index, and by factoring them out, “core” inflation c an provide a picture of where inflation is headed ."
" Y early core inflation was down in December to 5.7 percent, from 6 percent in November and a peak of 6.6 percent in September."
" Over   - 5 - the past three months, core CPI inflation has run at an annualized rate of 3.1 percent , a noticeable drop from earlier in 2022."
"  Another encouraging sign is that higher inflation was less concentrated—the share of categories of different goods and services with  inflation over 3 percent has declined in the past several months, from almost three fourths  in early 2022 to less than one half  in December ."
 That ’s good news because it indicates that broader inflationary pressure across the economy is easing.
"Now, here ’s why I am cautious about these latest res ults and why I am not ready yet to substantially alter my outlook for inflation."
 Monthover-month c ore CPI inflation actually ticked up in December from November and is pretty much where it was in October  and where it was in March when we began raising interest rates .
" Although inflation measured over 12 months has been falling, December’s reading is still close to where it was a year ago."
  Core inflation was 6 percent year over year (YOY) in January 2022 and was 5.7 percent  YOY last month .
" Back in 2021 , we saw three consecutive months of relatively low readings of core inflation before it jumped back up."
 I will be looking for the recent improvement in headline and core inflation to continue .
"Wages, as I indicated earlier, are another stream of data that I will be watching for evidence of continued progress to help ease overall inflation."
 The employment cost index for December  won’t be out until the end of this  month.
" Over time, we need to see wages grow more in line with productivity growth plus 2 percentage points , consistent with the FOMC’s inflation target ."
" Six months ago, when inflation was escalating and econ omic output had flattened, I argued that a soft landing was still possible —that it was quite plausible  to make progress on inflation without seriously damaging the  labor market."
"  I believe that monetary policy should continue to tighten, but using a comparison I employed in a speech a couple months ago, the view from the cockpit  is very different at 30,000 feet tha n it is c lose to the ground."
" But after front -loading monetary policy tightening, with many unprecedented  75 basis point  hikes  in the federal funds rate t arget , by early December I believed the policy stance was slightly restrictive , and I supported a decision by the Committee to hike  by a still considerable 50 basis points.2  To return to the airplane image, after climbing steeply and using monetary polic y to significantly raise interest rates throughout the economy, it was apparent to me that it was time to  slow, but not halt, the rate of ascent."
" Beyond that, we still have a considerable way to go toward our 2 percent inflation goal, and I expect to support continued tightening of mone tary policy."
