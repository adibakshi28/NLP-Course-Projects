" Our nation has made considerable progress since COVID19 hit the economy with great force a year ago, but we still have f urther  to go, and risks remain.1   As we all know, starting in late February or March of last year,  widespread economic and social lockdowns and other effects of  the COVID19 pandemic caused t he swiftest and deepest contraction in employment and economic activity since the Great Depression."
 We also cut short -term interest rates to near zero and began purchasing large quantities of Treasury and agency se curities to help sustain the flow of credit to households and businesses.
" Calm was restored in financial markets , and employment and output began growing in May, but it was a very deep hole to fill."
 Rapid progress over the summer gave way to slower growth over the past winter as COVID19 infection rates surged.
" Most of my FOMC colleagues expect the economy to  grow between 5.8 percent  and 6.6 percent  in 2021,  and the median projection is that the unemployment rate will fall to 4."
 My own expectation is for strong growth and a rebound in the labor force participation rate once the economy fully reopens .
"    As of February, the level of payroll employment is still 91/2 million below the prepandemic peak and more than 11 million below where it would have been based on the trend before the pandemic."
" I believe that job creation will continue, but I still see considerable uncertainty about the strength of that improvement and how long it may take to reach the Federal Reserve’s maximum -employment goal."
" While the headline unemployment rate has continued to fall, the number of people who report being unemployed for more  than six months has continued to rise, suggesting a risk of scarring—meaning  that some individuals could see an erosion of their skills and their connections to the labor market."
" Although economic activity in the travel, leisure , and hospitality sectors has continued to lag the recovery, there have been some bright spots elsewhere."
" Commodity prices for some crops have increased dramatically in the past few months, particularly s oybeans and corn, reflect ing higher export demand and some limits on global supply."
" Even with this, financial pressures on many small  2 The BLS counts an establishment as “closed” if it reports no employment (or does not report at  all) in the third month of the quarter after reporting positive employment in the third month of the previous quarter."
" The bankers I speak with have also noted that, while monetary policy has successfully delivered favorable borrowing conditions, many firms are reluctant to take on debt or additional borrowing because of the highly uncertain business climat e."
 Recent data from the from the Fed’s Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices tell a similar story:  The January edition of that survey showed a majority of banks reporting weaker demand for commercial and industrial loans to firms o f all sizes.
" For one, it is because t he roughly 32 million small businesses in the United States compris e an important source of job growth in the macroeconomy, and they have an outsized impact on their local communities."
" This, as I see it, is why the potential for a wave of small business failures is one of the main  risks to my expectation that our economy will make further substantial progress toward our goal of full employment."
"  I spoke earlier about employment , and I w ill now turn to the price -stability side of the Fed’s mandated goals for monetary policy."
" In recent months , we have seen consumer price inflation moving up, and I anticipate that the 12month rates in the next few months will very likely track above our 2 percent benchmark as the unusual softness in prices  - 8 - that we saw in April and May last year drops  out of the calculation."
 The marked rise in food prices  over the past 12 months has also pushed up the headline measures of price inflation.
"      Beyond this year, some observers have expressed concern that a rapid recovery in aggregate demand amid substantial fiscal support and accommodative monetary policy could lead to undesirably high inflation."
" While I expect that the stronger economy will push up inflation somewhat, let me explain why I do not expect pricing pressures to be excessive and why I believe the Federal Reserve is likely to continue supporting the economy for some time through accommodative monetary policy."
"    Here I will point to what has in the past seemed to be  a relationship between inflation and unemployment, known as the Phillips c urve."
" Over the past several decades, despite large swings  in unemployment, inflation has been extremely  stable ."
" As an example, u p to the beginning of the pandemic, when the economy was growing and unemployment was at a 50 year low of 3.5 percent , inflation was still very low and stable."
 Economists often attrib ute this so -called flat Phillips curve to the fact that individuals’ inflation expectations are well anchored and unlikely to respond to short -term pricing movements.
 Survey data on longrun inflation expectations tend to back up this idea.
" With all of th at said, given our  lack of historical experience with both this level of substantial fiscal stimulus and highly accommodative monetary policy,  my outlook for inflation is fairly uncertain ."
" When making monetary policy decisions, we would be concerned about a significant increase in inflation above our 2  percent goal that was sustained for some time."
" But as my Fed colleagues and I have said many times, monetary policy is not on a preset course."
" I will continue to monitor economic developments carefully, and , if my outlook for inflation were to change materially, my assessment of the appropriate stance of monetary policy would change as well."
  What does all of this mean for the outlook for monetary policy?
" As we indicated in the policy statement released last week, my FOMC colleagues and I expect to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until employment and inflation achieve levels consistent with our maximum employm ent and inflation goals."
