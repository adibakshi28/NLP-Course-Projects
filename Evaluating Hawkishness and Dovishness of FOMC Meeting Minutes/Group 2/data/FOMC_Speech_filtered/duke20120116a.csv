" Regardless of economic conditions, the acting profession has a n unemployment rate of about 95 percen t--or so it seemed to me at the time ."
" But in modern times, many people think of monetary policymaking as its primary role ."
" The Congress has given the Federal Reserve two objectives, known as our dual mandate :  to foster maximum employment and price stability."
" In its conduct of monetary p olicy, t he Fed influences the level of output and the level of prices in the economy through changes to interest rates and credit conditions."
"    During more -normal times, the Federal Reserve ’s policymaking is focused on short -term interest rates, our main tool for steering the economy."
  The Fed influences the costs of borrowing to buy everything from cars to condos to computers by controlling short -term interest rates.
"  Interest rates can be lowered to stimulate borrowing and spending when demand is otherwi se weak , or raised to damp demand and curb inflation."
" From a historical per spective, 2  percent is an extremely low level for interest rates ."
" For more than three  years now, our policies have held short -term interest rates close to zero."
" Just as the Federal Reserve used traditional concepts in unconventional ways to provide liquidity to the shadow banking system and stop the panic, o nce o ur main short -term interest rate lever was effectively at zero, we moved beyond traditional monetary policy to purchase longer -term assets and push down  longer -term interest rates."
" Those purchases put downward pressure on longer -term interest rates genera lly and   - 7 - helped normalize the spread between mortgage rates and long -term Treasury rates, which had widened during the financial crisis."
   Monetary policy decisions are made by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).
" While all 12 Reserve Bank presidents and all members of the Board of Governors participate in FOMC discussions, the voting members of the FOMC a re made up of the members of the Board of Governors, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank  of New York , and four of the remaining presidents on a rotating basis.3 In normal times, m onetary policy is implemented through the purchase or sale of securitie s, which affects the supply of bank reserves and so has an effect on short -term interest rates."
 But monetary policy also works by influenc ing expectations of future short -term interest rates and thereby affecting  longer -term rates and asset prices.
" Central bank communications can help individuals, businesses , and investors formulate their expectations for interest rates and inflation in the future and thus influence their actions today."
   Establishing a target for inflation is a tool used by many central banks to anchor inflation expectations.
" Central banks can establish such a target because , over the longer run , inflation is determined primarily by monetary policy."
" By contrast, t he level of unemployment that would be considered to be consistent with maximum employment  is influenced by factors other than monetary policy that may  vary over time."
 The di fficulty for the Federal Reserve  lies in communicating clearly about the employment portion of the mandate without creating an impression that the Committee is either establishing an unemployment target or ignoring that part of the mandate altogether.
   I do not believe that establishing an inflation target is inconsistent with a commitment to both parts of the dual mandate.
"  For example, if having an explicit  numerical target for inflation helps anchor inflation expectations  over the longer run , then monetary policy will have  greater flexibility to pursue the goal of maximum employment in the shorter term."
  The ability to make monetary policy decisions that are   - 10 - free of short -term political influence i s critical  for central banks.
 This capability is especially true because the  effective conduct of monetary policy require s a longterm perspective .
 A central bank that is subject to political pressure might opt for policies that favor rapid expansion  in the near term  at the expense of higher inflation in the future.
  Such actions would surely result in the loss of the public  confidence and credibility that are needed to achieve the objectives of monetary policy.
"  Indeed, research has shown that countries with independent central banks have better economic performance and lower inflation than countries whose central banks are not independent.4 The structure of the Federal Reserve is uniquely American in its decentralization."
