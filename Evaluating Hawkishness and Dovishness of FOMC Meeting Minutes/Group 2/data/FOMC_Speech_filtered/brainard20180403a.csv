"Guided by th at objective, our financial stability work rests on four interdependent pillars:  systematic analysis of fi nancial vulnerab ilities; standard prudential policies that safeguard the safety and soundness of individual banking organizations; additional policies, which I will refer to as ‚Äúmacroprudential,‚Äù that build resilience in the large, interconnected institutions at the core of the system; and countercyclical policies that increase resilience as risks build up cyclically.2This work also recognizes the important connections to our monetary policy objectives."
"That said, Treasury yields reflect historically low term premiums--the compen sation investors demand to hold assets over a 4For example, the priceto-rent ratios in Los Angeles, Miami, and Denver are 10 to 20 percent above their longrun trends, compared with 4 percent at the national level.5Similar volatility was seen in some other cryptocurrencies, such as Ether, XRP, and Litecoin.-4longer horizon."
" This poses the risk that term premiums could rise sharply--for instance, if investor perceptions of inflation risks incr eased."
"So far, the growth of alternative shortterm investment vehicles that could pose similar risks appears to have been weak.Finally, risks associated with leverage in the financial sector also appear to be subdued by historical standards."
The most prominent countercyclical feature of the stresstest scenario architecture is the setting of the unemployment rate in the severely adverse scenar io.
" The general rule is to increase the unemployment rate by 4 percent unless the baseline unemployment rate starts at levels below 6 percent, in which case the ultimate level of the unemployment rate reached in the severely adverse scenario is fixed at 10 percent."

"For example, in the 2016 exercise, losses amounted to $526 billion, while in 2017 they had fallen to $493 billion, despite a larger increase in the unemployment rate in the scenario.As economic conditions strengthen, typical measures of underwriting quality look strong,9Over the years, our adverse scenarios, which are no t designed to be the bi nding scenario for capital planning purposes, have featured large increases in Treasury yields across the maturity curve."
Countercyclical capital requirements canlean against a dangerous increase in financial vulnerabilities at a time when the degree of monetary tightening that would be needed to achieve the same goal would be inconsistent with the Federal Reserve‚Äôs dual mandate of full employment and price stability.
"The countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB) is designed to increase the resilience of large banking organizations when there is an elevated risk of abovenormal losses, which often follow periods of rapid asset price appreciation or credit growth that are not well supported by underlying economic fundamentals."
" Of course, our assessments of financial vulnerabilities are also an important input into Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) deliberations, recognizing that there is important interdependence between financial stability and our monetary policy objectives of full employment and price stability.10The FOMC Statement on LongerRun Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy notes that ‚Äúthe Committee‚Äôs policy decisions reflect ."

"While financial imbalances are an important consideration in monetary policymaking and the expected path of monetary policy can have important implications for financial vulnerabilities, both research and experience suggest there is no simple rule for accomplishing our dualmanda te and financial stability objectives through reliance on a single policy instrument.10 See the box ‚ÄúDevelop ments Related to Financial Stab ility‚Äù in Board of Gov ernors of the Federal Reserve System(2018), Monetary Po licy Report (Washington: Board of Governors, February), pp."

" If unemployment continues to decline at the rate of the past year, it could reach levels not seen in several decades."
" Historically, such episodes tended t o see a risk of accelerating inflation in earlier decades or a risk of financial imbalances in more recent decades."
" It is important to be attentive to the emergence of any imbalances, because we do not have muchexperience with procyclical fiscal stimulus at a time when resource constraints aretightening and growth is above trend.Despite elevated asset valuations, overall risks to the financial system remainmoderate in no small part because important financial reforms have encouraged large banking institutions to build strong capital and liquidity buffers."
" At a time when va luations seem stretched and cyclical pressures are building, I would be reluctant to see our large banking institutions releasing the capital and liquidity buffers that they have built so effectively over the past few years, especially since credit growth a nd profitability in the U.S. banking system are robust.Of course, if cyc lical pressures continue to bu ild and financia l vulnerabilities broaden, it may become appropriate to ask the largest banking organizations to build a countercyclical buffer of capital to fortify their resilience and protect against stress."
" Credit growth is robust, and banks are registering strongprofitability relative to their international peers."
