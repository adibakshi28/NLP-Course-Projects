" A strong banking industry is necessary for households and businesses to engage in the spending, saving , and investment that constitute economic activity, and one of the purpose s of financial regulation is to ensure that                                                  1 Wallace Stegner, “The American West as Living Space,” University of Michigan Press, 1988."
" - 4 -  also true that the change in population over time has a bearing on the economic health of communities and regions, and is part of the story for economic growth in the w estern United States."
" While we don’t have state or regional numbers for this year, from 2015 through 2017, GDP, after adjusting for inflation, grew two to nearly three times as fast in the West as in the rest of the United States."

" This picture of the West leading the nation in economic growth is also refle cted in population, a key factor in that growth."
" From 2010 to 2017, the population of the West increased 7.4 percent, compared to 5.3 percent for the nation.7  One might guess that this strong growth is primarily in cities, and in fact reflects the drain of population from smaller towns that is reported to be happening all over the United States."
"  In the cities of the West, those communities of 50,000 or more, the population grew 7.8 percent from 2010 to 2017, eclipsed by the 10 percent growth in s outhern cities but well above the 2 percent to 3 percent increase in the cities of the Northeast and Midwest.8  At the same time, the West led the other regions of the United States in growth for towns and cities from 10,000 to 50,000 in size, and likewise for towns between 5,000 and 10,000."

"In fact, the average w estern small town grew 7.8 percent in those seven years, which is roughly the same healthy pace of growth registered in w estern towns and cities from the smallest to the largest."
" Another lesson is that population growth and the atte ndant economic growth in the West is not zero sum, and that small towns can still grow healthily while the metropolises of the West continue to attract people, partly from outside the region."
" - 8 -  In any community, access to credit is essential for economic growth."
" In any community, but especially in rural communities, small businesses are key drivers of growth."
 But let me remind you of the very encouraging data I cited on the growth of small towns in the West.
 It is my hope that the opportunity for the future that this population growth suggests will support the local banks that communities need to thrive.
