"For release on delivery  12:15 p.m. EDT ( 10:15 a.m. MDT ) August 6 , 2022         Fight ing Inflation  in Challenging Times     Remarks by   Michelle  W."
" The number one challenge, of course, is inflation, which continues to be much too high, and a heavy burden for households and businesses."
 I will share my reasoning for supporting this increase and why I support continued increases until inflation is on a consistent path to significantly decline.
" Inflation continued to climb in June, reaching 9.1 percent as measured by the consumer price index."
" This is yet another concerningly high reading, and it set another 40year record high despite the expectation of many forecasters that inflation had peaked earlier in the year."
" I have seen few, if any, concrete indications that support this expectation, and I will need to see unambiguous evidence of this decline before I incorporate an easing of inflation pressures into my outlook."
"  Many of the underlying causes of excessive inflation are the same as they have been over the past year or so—supply chain issues, including those related to C hina’s  - 2 - COVID containment policies, constrained housing supply, the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, fiscal stimulus , and limitations on domestic energy production."
"   Regardless of the source of the inflationary pressure, the Federal Reserve has a duty to bring inflation down to our 2  percent target."
 This duty is mandated by Congress to carry out monetary policy that results in price stability —meaning low and stable inflation.
" We all understand why this is a critically important responsibility, especially in times of extreme inflation."
" For those workers who drive long distances to get to work, high inflation is especially concerning, requiring some to make tradeoffs between feeding their families and buying fuel to fill gas tanks."
" Therefore, in my mind, it is absolutely critical that we continue to use our monetary policy tools until we are successful in returning inflation to our 2  percent goal."
  Businesses are also suffering from elevated inflation through rising and volatile prices for inputs and the need to price their own goods and services to cover costs without losing customers.
"  - 3 -  I see a significant risk of high inflation into next year for necessities including food, housing, fuel, and vehicles."
" And I see continued inflation risk from motor vehicle prices, as auto manufacturers struggle with supply chain problems that haven’t i mproved significantly."
" Demand for cars continues to exceed supply, and retail used car prices are still very high, about 50  percent  more than before the pandemic."
 The supply problems pushing up inflation seem likely to persist.
" China has eased some of its most stringent COVID containment measures but recently revived travel restrictions in some areas, and its approach to the pandemic remains an upside risk for inflation."
" On the other side of our dual mandate, maximum employment, we continue to see a tight labor market, though there are some emerging signs that would support  - 4 - expectations of loosening."
  Yesterday’s job report showed continued significant growth in hiring with the unemployment rate finally returning to the pre -pandemic level of 3.5 percent.
" As I am sure you  all know, the job market in Kansas is even stronger, with an unemployment rate of 2.4 percent in June."
 One aspect of the job market that has not recovered is labor  force participation.
" In contrast to this labor market strength in Kansas and nationwide, output growth has slowed this year."
     My base case is for a pickup  in growth during the second half of this year and for moderate growth in 2023.
" From my perspective, had we known at the time about the eventual large upward revisions in last year’s employment data, we likely would have significantly accelerated our monetary policy actions."
" Taking all of that on board, while the data on economic activity are indeed lower and the view is murky, the evidence on inflation is absolutely clear, which brings me to the implications for monetary policy."
" My view is that similarly -sized increases should be on the table until we see inflation declining in a consistent, meaningfu l, and lasting way."
" In my view, that, combined with data revisions that wer e directly relevant to our decision making, led to a delay in taking action to address rising inflation."
   It is helpful that the FOMC provided clear direction earlier this year that it was prepared to act quickly to tighten monetary policy.
" Looking ahead, the FOMC will be getting two months of data on inflation and another month on employment before our next meeting in September, and while I expect that ongoing rate increases will be appropriate, given the uncertainty in how those  data and conditions will evolve, I will allow that information to guide my judgment on how big the increases will need to be."
" I do expect that the labor market will remain strong as we continue to increase interest rates and allow the balance sheet to run off, but there is a risk that our actions will  - 6 - slow job gains, or even reduce employment."
" Growth has softened, and perhaps this is an indication that our actions to tighten monetary policy are having the desired effect, with the ultimate goal of bringing demand and supply into greater balance."
" When considering the risks to the labor market, these risks must be viewed in the context of its current strength and with the understanding that our primary challenge is to get inflation under control."
" In fact, the larger threat to the strong labor market is excessive inflation, which if allowed to continue could lead to a further econom ic softening, risking a prolonged period of economic weakness coupled with high inflation, like we experienced in the 1970s."
" In any case, we must fulfill our commitment to lowering inflation, and I will remain steadfastly focused on this task."
 I look forwa rd to hearing how high inflation is affecting you and your communities and your thoughts on the regulatory agenda.
