" Significant job market changes in recent years,  brought about by global com petition and technological advances --and the new and shifting skills that these changes  demand --make workforce development more important than ever before."
" In fact,  two Federal Reserve Banks recently publi shed a framew ork describing how  workforce development initiatives can fit within a bank’s broader CRA strategy.3  While the job  market for the United States as a whole has improved markedly since the depths of the financial crisis, the persistently higher unemployment rates in lower -income and minority communities show why workforce development is so essential."
" F or instance, u nemployment rates averaged 13  percent in low - and moderate3 See Elizabeth Sobel Blum and Steven Shepelwich (2017), Engaging Workforce Development:  A Framework for Meeting CRA Obligations,  Federal Reserve Banks of Dallas and  Kansas City (Dallas:  FRB Dallas, January), https://www.dallasfed.org/ -/media/Documents/cd/pubs/workforce.pdf?la=en ."
  The  average u nemployment rate across all census tracts where minorities made up a majority of the population averaged 14.3 percent from 2011 through 2015.
" Also, a much smaller share of  the prime working -age population in these areas is employed--67.7 percent during this period, which is nearly 9 percentage points lower than in communities with smaller minority populations.5  These elevated unemployment rates and depressed employmentto-population ratios underscore the strong need for  effective workforce development options for these  communit ies."
 Statistics represent the average of census tract unemployment rates rather than the unemployment rate across all individuals in these tracts combined.
" And when they do attend college, those students are less likely to graduate.8  Among the reasons for the disparit y are a lack of money to pay for college and the burden of family responsibilities .9  As a result, the proportion of adults in low - and moderate -income communities from 2011 through 2015 who had a four -year college degree or graduate degree was about half  the share in higher -income communities --17.6 percent versus 34 percent.10   This educational disparity matter s because, among many reasons,  people with less education experience both higher unemployment and lower average earnings."
" In December 2016, for ex ample, the unemployment rate for people age d 25 and older  with a bachelor’s or higher degree was only 2.6 percent."
" - 5 - 5.1 percent, for workers in this age group with only a high school diploma and about triple, 7.9 percent, for those without a high school degree.11   While high  school graduates earn somewhat more than people who did not finish high school, the big payoff comes with a four -year college or advanced degree.12  The advantages of higher education, evidenced by lower unemployment rates and higher earnings, are clear across the spectrum but are greater for non -Hispanic whites than for African  Americans and Hispanics."

" First, it is crucial for younger workers to establish a solid connection to employment early in their work lives."
" The Federal Reserve’s 2013 Survey of Young Workers  found that 18to 30year-olds with early work experience were more likely to  emerge from the recent recession with a permanent job.19  Other s tudies have  found that students who worked 20 hours per week in the ir senior year of high school earned higher wages later in life than those wh o did not, and that summer youth employment programs improved participants’ attitudes toward their communities, raised their  academic aspirations, and boost ed their job readiness skills .20  The findings point to some of the reasons that the Boston Fed decid ed to lend technical support to a pilot program  called Pocket Change, which aims  to reduce unemployment among low -income 18 - to 24year-olds in Somerville, Massachusetts , through internships, training in job skills, and reinforcement of important soft skil ls such as  punctuality and effective communication."
"20 Baum and Ruhm (2016)  do obser ve, however,  that these gains from employment during the senior year of high school have diminished substantially relative to earlier cohorts."
"  - 10 - because it offered  training for in -demand  skills  and industry -recognized certifications,  and it focus ed on jobs that have clear paths for advancement.23 A fourth observation is that apprenticeships, which are more common in other countries, could play a larger role for low - and moderate -income individuals in our country as part of broader career and technical education efforts."
" The program has led to sizable job gains at  a modest cost to  the state.24  Similarly,  Washington State r egistered a pprenticeship program s contributed to substantial long -term increases  in employment rates and hourly wage s.25  My fifth and final observation is that promoting entrepreneurship could play a greater role in workforce development ."
" Yet we see less self -employment in low - and moderate -income                                                  23 For more on the WorkAdvance program, see the MDRC website at www.mdrc.org/project/workadvance#overview , and for information on that program  in Northeast Ohio, see the Towards Employment website at http://towardsemployment.org/strategic -initiatives/workadvance ."

"  In another example, the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City developed a  guide to help rural and smaller                                                  26 From 2011 through  2015, only 8 percent of households in low - and moderateincome communities reported self -employment income, compared with 11 percent of all households  (see ACS data releases in note 5)."
" This situation is true for many  minority, women, and low -income borrowers.30  Nontraditional  lenders , including more than 1,000 Community Development Financial Institutions  around the country, help fill the gap.31   Conclusion  To conclude, while the economy overall is recovering and the job market has improved substantially since the recession, pockets of persistently high unemployment, as well as other challenges, remain."
" F ortunately, programs such as the ones I  have highlighted today can help address these challenges in more targeted ways than the Federal Reserve is equipped to do through monetary policy."
