"EDT ( 10:25 a.m. local time ) July 31, 2017         The Low Level of Global Real Interest Rates     Remarks by   Stanley Fischer   Vice Chair man  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at the  Conference to Celebrate Arminio Fraga’s 60 Years   Casa das Garcas, Rio de Janeiro , Brazil         July 31, 2017     I am very happy to be participating in this conference celebrating Arminio."
" In particular, Arminio and his Central Bank  team ’s management of the exchange rate-- which at one point re ached 3.95 rea is per dollar --was masterly and put in place a sound foundation for that essential part of Brazil’s econom ic machiner y in the years that followed."
" Remember , most people lose half their IQ when they take a job such as this one.”   Now I will turn to the main topic of my discussion, the low level of global real interest rates, an important and  distinguishing feature of the current global economic environment."
" Yields have also declined in many emerging markets, with interest rates falling almost 400 basis points in Korea since the financial crisis an d by a similar amount in Israel."
" As shown in figure 2, the decline has been less apparent in Brazil and South Africa, though interest rates in both countries remain well below previous peaks."
" In this talk , I will address two questions:  Why are interest rates so low?"
 And why has the decline in interest rates been so widespread?1 Global R eal Interest R ates H ave D eclined  Lower inflation explains a portion of the decline in nominal interest rates.
" Longer -term interest rates reflect market participants’ exp ectations of future inflation as well as the expected path of real, or inflation -adjusted, interest rates."
" And while lower realized inflation and credible central back inflation targets have likely stabilized expected inflation at relatively low levels co mpared with  much of the 20th  century, inflation -adjusted yields have also notably dec reased."
The decline in interest rates also does not appear to be primarily an outcome of the economic cycle.
 Longer -term interest rates in the United States have remained  low even as the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has increased the short -term federal f unds rate by 100 basis points and as the unemployment rate has declined below the median of FOMC participants’ assessments of its longer -run normal level.
"  Rather , it appears as though much of the decline has occurred in the equilibrium level of the real interest rate --also known as the natural rate of interest or, alternatively,                                                  1 I am grateful to Joseph W."
" Knut Wicksell, in his 1898 treatise Interest and Prices , wrote , “There is a certai n level of the average rate of interest which is such that the general level of prices has no tendency to move either upwards or downwards.”2  In recent years, t he coincidence of low inflation and low interest rates suggests that  the natural rate of interest is likely very low today ."
Wicksell was clearly referring to the natural rate as the real interest rate when the economy is at full employment.
"  - 4 - equilibrium interest rates was most pronounced at the time of the financial crisis, but rates have shown little tendency to increase during the long recovery from the crisis."
" An Investment and Savings F ramework  There are many factors that could be holding down interest rates, some of which could fade over time, including the effects of quantitative easing in the United States and abroad and a heightened demand for safe asse ts affecting yields on advanced -economy government securities."
" In attempting to explain why real interest rates have fallen, a useful starting point is to think of the natural interest rate as the price that equilibrates the economy’s supply of saving with the demand for investment in the long run, when the economy is  at full employment."
" With this framework in mind, low interest rates reflect factors that increase saving, depress investment demand, or both."
"    Focusing initially on the United States, I will look at three interrelated factors that are likely contributing to low interest rates:  slower trend economic growth, an aging population and demographic developments, and relatively weak investment."
  But fi rst I would like to interject a quick word on why we as policymakers might be concerned about low interest rates.
" First, as John Maynard Keynes discussed in the concluding chapters of T he General Theory of Employment, Inte rest and Money , a low equilibrium interest rate increases the risks of falling into a liquidity trap, a situation where the nominal interest rate is stuck, by an  - 5 - effective lower bound, above the rate necessary to bring the economy back to potential.5  Relatedly, but more broadly, low equilibrium interest rates are a key pillar of the secular stagna tion hypothesis , which Larry Summers  has carried forward during the past few years .6  Second, a low natural rate could potentially hurt financial stability if it leads investors to reach for yield or  hurts financial firms’ profitability."
" And, third --and perhaps most troubling --a low equilibrium rate sends a powerful signal that the growth potential of the economy may be limited.7 Slow t rend growth One factor contr ibuting to low equilibrium interest rates in the United States has been a slowdown in the pace of potential, or trend, growth."
" According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), real potential growth in the United States is currently around 1.5 percent, compared with a pace about double that , on average , in the two decades leading up to the financial crisis."
" A prime culprit in the growth slowdown has been the slow rate of labor productivity growth, which has increased only 1/2 percent, on average, over the past five years , compared with  a 2 percent growth rate over the period from 1976 to 2005.8  A declining rate of labor force growth has also worked to push down trend growth."
 7 See Fischer (2016a) for a fuller discussion of the risks associated with a low equilibrium interest rate.
"  8 See Irwin (2017) for a n examination of an alternative pattern of causality, where slow growth --and, in particular, weak wage growth --has led to low productivity growth rather than vice versa."
      I should also remind the reader of Herbert Stein’s observation that the differen ce between a growth rate of 1 percent and a growth rate of 2 percent is 100 percent.
 Slower growth can both boost saving and depress investment.
" As households revise down their expectations for future income growth, they become less likely to borrow and more likely to save."
" Likewise, slower growth diminishes the number of business opportunities that can be profitably undertaken, weighing on investment demand."
Demographics  The aging of the population can work to lower the equilibrium interest rate beyond its effect on the size of the labor force and trend growth.
" Federal Reserve economists , in one study, estimate that higher saving by near -retirement households could be pushing down the longer -run equilibrium federal funds rate relative to its level in the 1980s by as much as 75 basis points.9    Investment    Another factor weighing on equilibrium real interest rates has been the recent weakness of investment."
 What explains the tepid response of capital spending  to historically low interest rates?
" As mentioned earlier, low prod uctivity growth has certainly been a contributing factor , as firms see fewer profitable investment opportunities."
" In an earlier  discussion, I attempted to quantify the effect that these factors --slow growt h, demographics, and investment --might be having on the long -run equilibrium rate in the United States.12  According to simulations from the Board’s FRB/US model, the slowdown in growth appears likely to be the primary factor depressing the long -run equilibrium rate, although the contributions from demographics and weak investment demand were also sizable."
" However, as I have pointed out earlier, the decline in interest rates is a global phenomenon."
 Why has the decline in interest rates been so widespread?
 One important reason is tha t many of the same factors that have been driving down the equilibrium interest rate in the United States have operated with equal or even greater force in  many foreign economies.
 The slowdown in labor productivity growth has been widespread  across many countries .
"     Another explanation is that we live in an integrated global economy where economic developments in one country spill  over into other countries via trade and capital flows as well as prices, including interest rates and exchange rates.13  In the most general sense, these spillovers are captured in the pattern of current balances, shown in figure 4."
" If we a bstract from a somewhat sizable statistical discrepancy, the sum of global current accounts should be equal to zero, as , in the aggregate , one country’s deficit must be matched by a surplus in some configuration of other countries --but it is not always apparent who is spilling over onto whom ."
"  Current Account Balances and Global Spillovers  Prior to the financial crisis, it was widely speculated that foreign developments were depressing U.S. interest rates."
 Former Chairman Bernanke characterized the foreign                                                  13 See Clarida (2017) for a model -based discussion of global factors and neutral interest rates.
"  - 9 - forces acting on U.S. interest rates as the “global saving glut ,” with particular referen ce to emerging market economies that were running persistent current account surpluses, sometimes as a resul t of specific policy decisions regarding exchange rates, reserve accumulation, and fiscal policy.14  The global saving glut was also a factor in the “Greenspan conundrum ,” or the observation that a ser ies of Federal Reserve rate hikes over the period from 2004 to 2006 seemed to have little effect on longer -term interest rates in the United States."
" As shown in f igure 5, the deterioration of the U.S. deficit in the early 2000s was matched by growing surpluses in the emerging markets, particularly in emerging Asia and China as well as OPEC."
" The explosive growth of the U.S. current account deficit from 2001 to 2006, coincident with falling interest rates both in the United States  and globally, supports the  notion that higher foreign saving relative to foreign investment was likely holding down U.S. interest rates at the time."
" As shown in fi gure 6, the most notable development has been the almost exact reversal of the expansion of the U.S. current account deficit observed during the time of the global saving glut ."
" Falling interest rate s over the period that the U.S. deficit narrowed suggest not.15  If a shrinking supply of foreign saving , the reversal of the global saving glut, was behind the narrowing of the U.S. deficit , then the tendency would have been for equilibrium real interest r ates to have increased.16  Rather , falling equilibrium  rates                                                  14 See Bernanke (2005)."
" 15 While it is unsurprising that interest rates fell sharply during the recession that follow ed the financial crisis, it is less apparent that equilibrium rates should have fallen so sharply or remain so low almost a decade later following the cyclical recovery in the United States and many other countries."
  - 10 - suggest that falling  U.S. demand for foreign saving s has  precipitated the narrowing of the U.S. current account deficit.
" U.S. demand likely decreas ed for the reasons discussed earlier, including slowing growth, demographics, and weak investment demand."
Does the marked narrowing of the U.S. current account deficit post -crisis suggest that the U nited States  has been the primary source of downward pressur e on global interest rates over the past decade?
" Certainly, if the U nited States  had maintained its previous deficit, interest rates would likely be higher around the world."
" However, the financial crisis revealed that the U.S. capacity to absorb global s avings at the pace observed prior to the crisis was unsustainable.17  Rather, an alternative explanation would be that the sharp decline in global interest rates post -crisis reflects factors that were likely well in train before the financial crisis."
" The d ownward trend in interest rates would have been more pronounced earlier in the decade had not elevated, and ultimately unsustainable, borrowing in the United States slowed the decline in interest rates in the years immediately preceding the crisis."
"  This n arrative is  consistent with empirical evidence that suggests that the slowdowns  in global productivity growth and labor force growth, both key factors in the slowing pace of global growth and the downward pressure on interest rates , predate the global financial crisis.18 It is notable in figure 6 that the euro area has also seen a sizable increase in its current account position post -crisis, suggesting that developments in Europe have also played a role in pushing down interest r ates."
"   - 11 - account in part reflects sharp reversals in the current account deficits of Greece, Portugal, Spain, and Ireland --all countries that had witnessed large increases in their deficits during the global saving glut period prior to the crisis, i n a pattern similar to that experienced by the Un ited States."
"          What, I f Anything, C an B e Done about L ow Interest Rates?"
" Given the potential risks around low interest rates I discussed earlier, including the impact on the effectiveness of monetary policy and financial stability concerns, what should policymakers do to address the problem?"
   Monetary policy has a role to play.
" Transparent and sound monetary policy can boost confidence in the stability of the growth outlook, an outcome that can in turn alleviate precautionary demand for saving s and encourage investment, pus hing up the equilibrium interest rate."
"  However,  as I have said before --and Ben Bernanke before me-- “Monetary policy is not a panacea."
"”19  Also , to repeat myself, policies to boost productivity growth and the longer -run potential of the economy are more likely to be found in effective fiscal and regulatory measures than in central bank actions."
 But it is not to say that monetary policy is irrelevant to the growth rate of the economy.
