" Pent -up demand has outstripped capacity in some sectors, as businesses that had pared back  to survive the pandemic are  encountering bottlenecks as they rehir e and restock.1  These mismatches have made it more difficult to interpret the first few months of reopening  data."
"   The second quarter of 2021 saw a large wave of demand buoyed by fiscal transfers, resulting in annu alized real personal consumption expenditures (PCE) growth of 11.8 percent ."
" Real gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of 6.5  percent in the second quarter  of 2021, slightly less than many forecasters had projected, as that strong consumer demand outstripped production, resulting in a significant decline in inventories ."
  The tailwinds to growth from the fiscal stimulus during the first half are shifting to headwinds that will continue through the remainder of 2021 and 2022.
" Even so, pent -up consumption and full reopening are expected to more than offset fiscal headwinds in the second half such that PCE is expected to grow at a robust rate, and growth is expected to remain strong through the remainder of the year."
" By the end of the year, the U.S. economy is expected to achieve average annualized growth of 2.2 percent since the onset of COVID19—slightly above most estimates of longer -term potential output growth."
" In short, growth this year is expected to compensate fully for last year’s sharp contraction —as a result of the strong policy response , effective vaccines, and the resilience and adaptability of American households, workers, and businesses ."
"  - 2 - While we are seeing progress on employment , joblessness remains high and continues to fall disproportionately on African Americans and Hispanics and lower -wage workers in the services sector."
"  Last December, the Committee indicated that asset purchases would continue until s ubstantial further progress toward our employment and inflation goals had been achieved."
" The employment -topopulation (EPOP) ratio is 3.2 percentage points short of its pre -pandemic level for prime -age workers, a group that is not affected by the elevated level of early retirements during the pandemic."
" Thus, as of June, we had closed between one -fourth and one -third of the  employment shortfall relative to last Decembe r according to a variety of measures."
"  Currently, it  is difficult to disentangle the effects on labor supply of caregiving responsibilities brought on by the pandemic, fears of  contracting the virus, and the enhanced unemployment insurance that was  designed in part to address such constraints."
" If , instead, the rate of job growth were to accelerate notab ly, those levels could be reached somewhat sooner ."
"   Today’s  data showed that core PCE inflation rose 0.45 percent in June, once again driven by outsized contributions from a handful of  categories."
 Recent  high inflation readings reflect supply–demand mismatches in a handful of  sectors that  are likely to prove  transitory.
" In assessing inflation, an annualized 24 -month measure that looks through the steep declines and subsequent rebound in prices  in categories affected by the pandemic currently has core PCE inflation running at 2.3 percent and headline PCE inflation running at 2.4 percent."
"   - 4 - I am attentive to the risk that inflation pressures could broaden or prove persistent , perhaps as a  result of wage pressures, persistent increases in rent, or businesses passing on a larger fraction of cost increases rather than reduc ing markups , as in recent recoveri es."
 I am particularly attentive to any signs that currently high inflation readings are pushing longer -term inflation expectations above our 2 percent objective .
" Most measures of survey - and market -based expectations suggest that the current  high inflation pressures are transitory, and underlying trend inflation remains near its pre -COVID trend."
" Since the June  FOMC meeting, five -year, five -yearforward inflation compensation based on Treasury InflationProtected Securities  has declined  a little less than 20 basis points , on net, and it currently stands at 2.2  percent , at the low end of its range of values prior to the 2014 decline ."
 The second -quarter reading from the Federal Reserve Board ’s index of common inflation expectations  stands at 2.
"05 percent, which is at the bottom of the range that prevailed  from 2008 to 2014, when 12month total PCE inflation averaged 1.7 percent.3   Many of the forces currently leading to outsized gains  in prices  are likely to dissipate by this time next year."

"  - 5 - While there is good reason to expect that the inflation dynamics that prevailed for a quarter -century will reassert themselves on the other side of reopening, I will remain vigilant to any signs that inflationary pressures are likely to prove more persistent or that expectations are moving above target."
" If inflation moves persistently and materially above our target, we would adjust policy to guide i nflation gently back to target."
 Twenty -fourmonth core PCE inflation is now running at a 2.3 percent average annualized rate.
" In contrast , employment is still down by 6.8 million  to 9.1 million relative to its pre -COVID level and trend, respectivel y, and it has closed about one -fourth to one -third of its  December  gap."
 The determination of when to begin to slow asset purchases will depend importantly on the accumulation of evidence that substantial further progress on employment has been achieved.
" As of today, employment has some distance to go."
   It is important to emphasize that  the achievement of substantial progress that will determine when the Committee starts reducing the pace of asset purchases is distinct from the maximum employment and inf lation outcomes that are in the forward guidance  - 6 - for the policy rate.
 R emaining attentive to changing conditions and steady in our step -bystep approach to implementing policy under  our new framework should ensure that the economy’s momentum is sufficien t when tailwinds shift to headwinds  to achieve and sustain  maximum employment and inflation robustly anchored at 2 percent.
