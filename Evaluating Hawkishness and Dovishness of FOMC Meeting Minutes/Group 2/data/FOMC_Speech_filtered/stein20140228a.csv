"For release on delivery  10:15 a.m. EST   February 28, 2014          Comments on  “Market Tantrums and Monetary Policy ,” a paper by  Michael Feroli, Anil K ."
"Stein   Member   Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at the  2014 U.S. Monetary Policy Forum , sponsored by the Initiative on Global Markets  at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business   New York, New York         February 28, 2014    I am delighted to have the opportunity to discuss th e paper  “Market Tantrums and Monetary Policy .”  It is timely, provocative, and extremely insightful."
" Moreover, the model has the feature that this reach for yield can end badly, with a sudden and sharp correction in risk premiums that arises endogenously in response to a small tightening o f monetary policy."
" Given this limitation of regulation, and because monetary policy has a direct influence on the behavior of asset managers, the financial  stabilit y risks that these                                                  1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily shared by other members of the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Open Market Committee."
  - 2 - managers create should be factored into the design and conduct of monetary policy.
" Presumably, this consideration would imply that monetary policy should be somewhat less easy in a weak economy, all else being equal, to reduce the proba bility of an undesirable upward spike in rates and credit spreads down the road."
" This is the spirit in which I will discuss the paper --not as a comment on the current stance of policy, but as an exploration of the fac tors that should be taken into account when thinking about the tradeoffs associated with monetary policy more generally."
" In particular, her e is how I think about the v alueadded of the theory:  On the one hand , an emerging body of empirical work documents that an easing of monetary policy --even via conventional policy tools in normal times --tends to reduce both the term premiums on long -term Treasury bonds and the credi t spreads on corporate bonds.3  That is, monetary policy tends to work in part through its effect  on capital  market risk premiums, perhaps through some sort of risk -taking or reaching -foryield mechanism."
"  On the other hand , while this empirical observati on sheds some interesting light on how monetary policy influences the real economy, it does not by itself suggest that there is any financial  stability dark side to the lowered risk premiums that go with                                                  2 See Feroli and others (2014), p."
" The fact that its liabilities are not technically debt claims is not all that helpful in this case --they are still demandable, and hence invest ors can pull out very rapidly if the terms of exit create a penalty for being last out the door."
"  In the latter case, when the problem is driven more by the portfolio choices of fund managers, it is harder for me to see an obvious regulatory response, so I am more inclined to share the authors’ view that if there is , indeed , a significant financial  stability problem, monetary policy would be left to take up some of the slack."
" First, I think they are absolutely on target in emphasizing that the ra pid growth of fixed -income funds --as well as other , similar vehicles --bears careful watching."
" Second, I also agree that there is no general separation principle for monetary policy and financial stability."
 Monetary policy is fundamentally in the business of  altering risk premiums such as term premiums and credit spreads.
 So monetary policymakers can not wash their hands of what happens when these spreads revert sharply .
"   - 9 - regulation or with monetary policy, it  becomes all the more critical to get the case -bycase analysis right --that is, to really dig into the microeconomic details of the presumed market failure and to ask when a regulatory intervention is comparatively more efficient than a monetary one, or vice versa ."
