"For release on delivery  Noon EDT  June 21, 2019         Fed Listens in Cincinnati : How Does Monetary Policy Affect Your Community?"
  The Federal Reserve is reaching out to communities around the country to hear  how Americans are experiencing the economy day to day and to make sure  we are carrying out the monetary policy goals assigned to us by the Congress in the most effective way we can .2   The Congress has assigned  the Federal Reserve to use monetary policy to achieve maximum employme nt and price stability.
" B y price stability , we mean moderate  and stable inflation."
 The Federal Open Market Committee  (FOMC) —the group at  the Fed responsible for determining monetary policy—has announced that our  goal is to keep inflation around 2 percent  over time.
 The maximum -employment part of our dual mandate means that  the Congress has directed us to achieve the highest level of employment  that is consistent with price  stability.

" Although the pace of payroll gains has moderated recently, u nemployment is at a 50year low, wages are growing, participation in the labor force has expanded, a nd unemployment insurance claims are at cycl e lows."
" Crosscurrents from policy uncertainty have risen since early May, cr imping business investment plans , raising concerns in some financial market segments , and weighing on global growth prospects ."
 Foreign authorities are seeking additional policy space to address growth and inflation shortfalls .
" In addition, r ecent indicat ors of  inflation and inflation expectations have been disappointing, making it all the more important to  sustain  the economy’s  momentum."
"  The downside risks, if they materialize, could weigh on economic activity."
" B asic principles of risk management in a low neutral rate environment with compressed  conventional  policy space  would argue for  softening the expected path of policy when risks shift to the downside .3   Our Review  With recent indicators suggesting the expansion is continuing at a solid pace and unemployment at a 50year low , inflation has  not yet moved to our goal on a sustained                                                  3 One reason for cautio n is the risk of building financial market imbalances, such as currently elevated levels of risky corporate debt."
" In my view, it is better to address such financial imbalances by activation of our countercyclical capital buffer, rigorous use of stress test s, and beefed -up monitoring of leveraged lending  than by monetary policy."
" In parallel, i t is also vital that a central bank meets its inflation target on a sustained basis, which will  provide more capacity  to buffer the economy i f it encounters headwinds."
" First, interest rates have stayed  very low in recent years in the United States  and in many other advanced economies , and it seems likely  that equilibrium  interest rates will remain low in the future."
 Low interest rates present a challenge for traditional monetary policy in recessi ons.
" In the past, t he Federal Reserve has typically cut interest rates 4 to 5 percentage points in order  to suppor t household spending and business investment ."
" However , when equilibrium interest rates are low, we have less room to cut interest rates and less room to buffer the economy using our conventional tool ."
"  Another big change in the economy is that inflation does  not move as much with economic activity and employment as it has in the past , which is what economists mean when they say the Phillips c urve is very flat."
" A  flat Phillips curve  has important advantages :  The labor market can strengthen a lot and pull many workers who may have been sidelined back into productive employment without an acceleration in inflation, unlike what we saw  in the 1960s and 1970s."

"   - 4 - On the other hand, t oday’s low sensitivity of inflation to slack , along with the limited ability to cut interest rates in a recession , means it  can be more difficult to achieve our 2 percent inflation objective on a sustainable b asis."
" The limited ability to cut interest rates could provide less ability to buffer the economy in a downturn, while the very flat Phillips curve could make it harder to boost inflation during an expansion."
"  As we have seen in  other countries, if inflation consistently falls short of the central bank’s objective, consumers, workers, and businesses start to expect lower inflation  to continue."
" E xpectations of low  inflation can create a self -fulfilling dynamic with actual inflation , making it even more difficult for the central bank to boost inflation."
" And because inflation is reflected in nominal interest rates,  that, in turn , can reduce the amount of policy space the central bank has ava ilable to prevent the economy from slipping into recession ."
"  Some Issues to Explore  Given  the new normal of low equilibrium  interest rates and low sensitivity of inflation to slack, it is prudent to assess how well various approaches worked both here and around the world, with a view  to identifying the best ways to  promote the goals the Congress assigned to us ."
  One of the idea s discussed in Chicago is that the Federal Reserve should explicitly promise to “make up” for misses on inflation during a downturn.
" The Federal Reserve c ould hold interest rates lower after a recession is over, perhaps by promising not to raise interest rates until inflation or the unemployment rate have reached particular level s.5  A related idea discussed in Chicago is average inflation targeting , meaning the Federal Reserve would aim to achieve its inflation objective , on average , over a long er period of time —perhaps over the business cycle.6  This approach c ould also have aspects of a makeup policy, depending on how it is designed."
" There is some skepticism that  a central bank would in fact prove able to support above -target inflation over a sus tained period without becoming concerned that inflation might accelerate, and inflation expectations might rise too high."
" At the  Chicago conference, we also heard how difficult it can be to estimate with any precision the “maximum employment”  leg of our dual mandate.7  There is no fixed destination point for maximum employment —no single  number where we can be sure we                                                  5 See Sharon Kozicki (2019), “Monetary Policy Strategies for the Federal Reserve:  Discussion of Practical Considerations,” presentation at the Conference on Monetary Policy Strategy, Tools, and Communications Practices, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, June 5, https://www.chicagofed.org/~/media/others/events/2019/monetary -policy -conference/2 -kozicki -comments -strategies -pdf.pdf ."

" That is very different fro m the longer -run level of  inflation, which  central banks are presumed able to determine over time ."
 T he Federal Reserv e communicate s with the public about monetary policy th rough a variety of channels.
" Twice a year, the Federal Reserve submits a Monetary Policy Report  to the Congress."
"  We heard in Chicago that  most members of the public  care a lot about the job market and the cost of credit, but they are not aware of  our communic ations  about monetary policy.8  Of course, t he media plays an important role in communicating our monetary policy actions and how they affect the economy."
"  Since I arrived  at the Fed, I have derived tremendous benefit from  visiting communities all over the country to hear from                                                  8 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2019), “ Panel 1:  What Does Full Employment Look Like for Your Community or Constituency?"
