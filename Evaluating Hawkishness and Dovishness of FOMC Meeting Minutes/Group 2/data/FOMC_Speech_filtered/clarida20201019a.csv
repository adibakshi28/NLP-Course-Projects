"Clarida   Vice Chair   Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at the  Unconventional Convention of the American Bankers Association   Washington, D.C.  (via webcast)         October 19, 2020   It is my pleasure to meet virtually  with you today at the Unconventional Convention of the  American Bankers Association .1  I look forward to my conversation with Rob  Nichols , but first, please allow  me to offer a few remarks on the economic outlook, Federal Reserve monetary policy, and some of the initiatives  we have announced to support the fl ow of credit to households and firms during these challenging times."
" The flow of macrodata received  since May has been surprisingly strong, and GDP growth in the third quarter is estimated by many forecaster s to have rebounded at roughly a 30 percent annual rate."
 This development is especially noteworthy when set in relief against the surge in new C OVID -19 cases that were reported this summer in a number of U.S. states and the coincident flatlining  in a number of highfrequency activity indicators that we follow to track the effect of the virus on economic activity.
 These components of aggregate demand have benefited from robust fiscal                                                  1 The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of other Federal Reserve Board members or Federal Open Market Committee participants.
  - 2 - support —including expanded unemployment benefits  and the Small Business Administration’s Paycheck Protection Program (PPP)—as well as low interest rates and efforts by the Federal Reserve to sustain the flow of credit to households and firms.
" In the labor market, about half of the 22 million jobs that were lost in the spring have been restored, and the unemployment rate has fallen  since April by nearly 7 percent age points to 7.9 percent as of September."
 It will likely take even longer than that for the unemployment rate to return to a level consistent with our maximum -employment mandate.
" However, it is worth highlighting that the Committee’s baseline projections summarized in the most recent S ummary of E conomic Projections  foresee a relatively rapid return to mandate -consistent levels of employment and inflation as compared with the recovery from the Global Financial Crisis (GFC).2  In particular, the median Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC)  participant projects that by the end of 2023—a little more than three years from now —the unemployment rate                                                  2 The most recent Summary of Economic Projections, an addendum to the minutes of the September 2020 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, is available on the Board’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm ."
"  - 3 - will have fallen to 4  percent , and PCE (personal consumption expenditures) inflation will have returned to 2 percent."
" Following the GFC, it took more than eight years for employ ment and inflation to return to similar mandate -consistent levels."
" We indicated that, with inflation running persis tently below 2 percent, our policy will aim to achieve i nflation outcomes that keep inflation expectations well anchored at our 2 per cent longer -run goal."
" W e said that we expect to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomes —as well as our maximum -employment mandate —are achieved, and also that we expect it will be appropriate to maintain the current 0 to 1/4 percent target range for the federal funds rate until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessments of maximum employment , until  inflat ion has risen to 2 percent , and until inflation is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time."
" Concluding Remarks  While recovery since the spring collapse in economic activity has been  robust , let us not forget that the full economic recovery from the COVID -19 recession has a long way to go, with the unemployment rate still elevated at 7.9 percent  as of September and inflation  still running below our 2 percent longer -run objective."
" It will take some time to return  to the levels of economic activity and employment that prevail ed at the business cycle peak in February, and additional support from monetary—and likely fiscal —polic y will be needed."
