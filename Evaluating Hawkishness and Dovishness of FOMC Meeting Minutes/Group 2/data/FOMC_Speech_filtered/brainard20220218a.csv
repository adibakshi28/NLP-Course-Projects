" With technology driving profound change, it is important we prepare f or the financial system of the future and not limit our thinking  to the financial system of today.1    The Evolving Digitalization and Decentralization of Finance   In recent years, there has been explosive growth in the development and adoption of new digital assets that leverage distributed ledger technologies and cryptography."
" The market capitalization of cryptocurrencies gr ew from less than $100 billion five years ago to a high of almost $3 trillion in November  2021 and is  currently  around $2 trillion.2   In parallel, w e have seen rapid  growth in the  platforms that facilitate the crypto finance ecosystem , including decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms ."
"  The growth in the crypto finance ecosystem  is fueling demand for stablecoins —digital asset s that are intended  to maintain stable value relative to reference  assets, such as the U.S. dollar."
" As noted in a recent report on stablecoins by the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets, it is  important to guard against  run risk , whereby the prospect of a n issuer not being able to promptly and adequately meet redemption requests for the  stablecoin at par  could result in a sudden surge in redemption demand.4  It is also  important to address  settlement risk , where by funds settlemen t is not certain and final when expected, and systemic risk, where by the failure or distress of a stablecoin provider could adversely affect the broader financial system .5    3 “Total Stablecoin Supply,” The Block, last modified on February 14, 2022, https://www.theblockcrypto.com/data/decentralized -finance/stablecoins/total -stablecoin -supply -daily ."
" Growing  interest in the digital financ ial ecosystem  suggest s that technology is enabl ing potential improvements that merit consider ation .10  In addition, it is important to consider how new forms of cryptoassets and digital money may affect the Federal Reserve’s responsibiliti es to maintain financial stability, a  safe and efficient paymen t system,  household and business  access to safe central bank money, and maximum employment  and price  stability."
" A CBDC—depending on its features —could be attractive  as a store of value and means of payment to the extent it is seen as the safest form of money.13  This  could make it attractive to risk -averse users, perhaps leading to increased  demand for the CBDC at the  12 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System , “Money and Payments: The U.S. Dollar in the Age of Digital Transformation ,” research paper  (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, January 2022), https://www .federalreserve.gov/publications/files/money -andpayments -20220120.pdf ."
" It is prudent for the Board to understand the evolving payment landscape, the technological advancements and consumer demands driving this evolution, and the consequent policy choices as i t seeks to fulfil l its c ongressionally -mandated role to promote a safe, efficient, and inclusive system for U .S."
