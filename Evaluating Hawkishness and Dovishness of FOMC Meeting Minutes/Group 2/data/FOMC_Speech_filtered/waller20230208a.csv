"Waller   Member     Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at  2023 Arkansas State University Agribusiness Conference          Jonesboro, Arkansas            February 8, 2023    Thank you, Bert, and thank you for the opportunity to talk about where the economy is head ing, what the Federal Reserve is doing to get inflation back down to our 2 percent goal, and how all that is likely to affect American agriculture.1 The big picture is that the U.S. economy is adjust ing well so far to the higher interest rates  that are necessary to rein in inflation."
" But inflation remains quite elevated , and so more  needs to be done."
" A lthough e conomic activity slowed in 2022, I expect the Fed will need to keep a tight stance of monetary policy for some time  to slow activity further in 2023."
 T hat is what I believe is needed to bring demand and supply into  better alignment and lower  inflation toward the Federal Open Market Committee’s  (FOMC)  2 percent target .
 Some believe that inflation will come down quite quickly this year.
" But I’m not seeing signals of this quick decline in the economic data, and I am prepared for a longer fight to get inflation down to our target ."
" It looks like the econom y grew  at a solid  pace in the final quarter of the year, the labor market remained  tight , and inflation continued to retreat ."
" After adjusting for inflation, personal consumption grew at around a 2 percent rate, though it contracted in the last two months of the year amid  some pretty significant headwinds."
"  One of those headwinds was high inflation, including for food and agricultural products."
" After  accounting for  inflation, s pending on food consumed at home fell in 2022 after rising strongly in 2020 and 2021, the effect of both large price increases over  1 I am grateful to Katia Peneva for assistance in preparing these remarks."
" It looks as though economic activity may be moderating further in the first quarter of 2023, but I expect the  U.S. economy to  continue  grow ing a t a modest pace this year , supported by a strong labor market and by encouraging progress in lowering inflation ."
"  Though we have made progress  reducing inflation, I want to be clear today that the job is not done."
 Inflation is still too high relative to the price stability goal of the dual mandate assigned to the Federal Reserve by Congress .
" The Fed has defined that goal as 2 percent annual inflation , as measured by the change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures , but another yardstick you could use is when high prices for groceries and other things are no longer front page news, and when farmers can worry less about rising costs for fertilize r and other inputs."
" Our intention is to tighten financial conditions, including rais ing the cost of credit , to dampen demand and spending to further reduce inflation."
" Of course,  we know that higher interest rates pose challenges for farmers and ranchers who must borrow to smooth out the costs and returns from agriculture over the year."
" But  excessive inflation is a larger challenge because it has the potential to become a lasting problem weighing on economic growth, undermining living standards , and hurting consumers , who farmers  - 3 - depend on."
" That is why I am determined to get the job done , get high inflation off the front pages, and back to being something that households and businesses don’t think too much about when making decisions."
" Continued upward pressure on inflation come s, in part, from a very tight labor market."
" The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey for December continued to show that the demand for workers remains robust , with job openings increasing by over 500,000 at the end of last year ."
" Based on last Friday’s initial estimate, w e learned that the U.S. economy created a whopping 517,000 jobs in January , 330,000 more than t he solid growth that was expected by economic forecasters."
" Furthermore , the unemployment rate ticked down to 3.4 percent , the lowest level since 1951."
"  Such employment gains  mean labor income will also be robust and buoy consumer spending, which could maintain upward pressure on inflation in the months ahead."
" For example, last year the Employment Cost Index (ECI) , which tracks movements in labor costs , including both wages  and benefits , increased over 5 percent, the highest rate since 1984."
  We have seen some moderation in compensation growth in r ecent months  but not enough.
" The  data are  moving in the right direction , but I will watch for further slowing because we don’t want excessive wage increases to be a potential source of higher inflation in the future ."
 So now  let’s talk about inflation.
" I will start with overall inflation and then focus on the different components, including food."
 I will talk about what those components can tell us about the direction of overall inflation and how I look at the different parts of inflation in my approach to monetary poli cy.
Figure 1 depict s inflation measured by two  common indexes.
" “ Overall ” or “headline”  inflation indexes are measured as the rate of increase in the average price level of a broad group of goods and services , called a market basket."
 G overnment statistics on the  inflation rate will be a function of the specific goods and services included in the market basket.
 Including a different set of goods and services in the market bas ket will result in a different overall inflation rate.
  Probably the most oftendiscussed inflation measure in the United States is one based on the consumer price index (CPI).
 The FOMC chose the PCE  index over the CPI  for its inflation target in part because it includes a broader set of goods and services in its market basket and is widely believed to better capture changes in the mix of goods and services purchased by consumers .
" Monetary policy works with a lag, and after the Federal Reserve started raising interest rates last March, inflation peaked in the middle of 2022 and has been falling gradually since then."
" By comparison, over the final three months of 2022, headline inflation was much lower, running at an annualized rate of just 2."
" As has been the case since the summer, falling energy prices are a big reason for lower inflation in the last few months , though food price inflation also moderated  in the final few months of 2022."
" As we can see in the figure, though PCE inflation is down from its peak, it is still quite elevated."
" I need to be  confident that inflation is declining in a sustained manner towards our 2 percent target , so I will need to see continued moderation in inflation before my outlook changes."
 - 6 - So where do I think inflation is heading?
"  You will often hear economists talk about core inflation, which strips out energy and food prices , which tend to be volatile."
 The core measure is considered  a better guide to the direction of future inflation.
 Y ou might wonder why it is that the Fed doesn’t just target core inflation in measuring progress toward our price stability goal.
" There are some good reasons for keeping the focus on overall inflation, and in front of an audience of people who pay a lot of  attention to food price inflation, I thought I would take a couple minute s to explain why I consider food and all of the  components of inflation to be so important in  my approach to setting monetary policy."
" The argument for stripping out  food and energy p rices is that they tend to be quite volatile , with big ups and downs tending to equal out over time, and thus  do not provide a clear  signal of how inflation in these categories will evolve ."
 One can see the recent volatility in figure 2 that reports 12month  rates of inflation for food and energy.
 And I’m sure I don’t have to tell anyone that food inflation has been quite high relative to its pre -pandem ic average.
" Of course, food prices haven’t  increased as much as energy prices , but food inflation has risen  notably in 2021 and 2022 and has been running above 10 percent recently, which is unusually high."
" As shown in figure 3, inflation for agricultural chemicals, such as fertilizer, skyrocketed in  - 7 - 2021 and continued up in early 2022 and , though this inflation has moderated in recent months, the price level  of agricultural  chemicals  remain s very high."
"  Core inflation , as shown in Figure 4, didn’t rise as much as headline inflation in this recent period of high food and energy price in creases , and lately it hasn’t moderated as much."
" Core inflation stood at 4.4 percent in December, over double the Fed’s 2 percent target for headline inflation."
" Core inflation includes a measure of h ousing services, which is what households pay for rent or the equivalent  for those who own their homes."
 Housing services  inflation  has been stubbornly high for all of 2022  and is a big factor driving up core inflation .
" There is good reason to believe rents  will moderate significantly over this year  and so some people have suggested that the focus should be on a “super core” measure of inflation that exclud es food, energy, and housing."
 That would make inflation look not nearly as bad over the last year or two and also likely not show much  improvement in the coming months .
   But there are a few  reasons why I don’t let these stripped -down measures of inflation shape my views of the inflation environment .
" The second reason that I wouldn’t exclude food, energy, and housing prices, or want to move toward a narrower inflation target, is that , by any measure of headline  inflation, they constitute a large share of expenses paid by people ."
" The third reason to include, rather than exclude, these prices in considering inflation is that the y make up an even larger share of expenses for lower -income people, who have less savings and other means to deal with the ups and downs of their finances and the economy."
" B ecause of this disparity, when inflation peaked last summer , lower -income households effectively faced inflation that was a percentage point higher than was paid by higher -income households .3   Lastly , and this is really the bottom line, the Fed has stated that it s target for inflation is headline PCE prices."
 Figure 5 shows how housing inflation has been evolving both when measured on a 12month basis (left panel) and 3month basis (right panel).
" As I just noted, housing inflation has been stubbornly elevated ."
 This is true if you look at inflation over the past year or just at recent months.
" See https://paper s.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4033572   - 9 - frequency measures of market rents (for new leases by new tenants) have  slowed  sharply, suggesting an upcoming slowing in the rate of inflation in th is part of the PCE basket."
" Because rents usually don’t change until leases run out, these recent declines in market rent inflation will only show through to the official inflation measure with a delay ."
" So I expect, over time, that housing inflation will move down to be more in line with core inflation."
" Turning to food, which represents about 7.5 percent of consumption in the PCE basket, figure 6 shows that the 12month change in PCE food prices has greatly outpaced that of core PCE inflation over the past couple of years."
 But food inflation is still above the average annual  pace of 1.1 percent over the ten years preceding the pandemic.
" This ongoing elevated food inflation likely reflects passthrough of the past strong increases in food commodity prices, rising labor and fuel costs, as well as supplychain bottlenecks in packaging and transportation that have limited supplies amid strong demand."
" If this plays out, with a slowdown in wage increases that should occur because of tighter monetary policy, this should help continue to moderate food inflation over the next few years."
" Finally, let’s turn to energy inflation."
" I think there are practical implications for getting a clear picture of the economy and setting appropriate monetary policy, and also a reminder for me about the trust I bear as a public official."
" Most pract ically, if I had focused on core inflation over the last two years and tended to look past  increases for food and energy, and especially for housing, I w ould have missed an alarming increase in inflation, and reacted more slowly than my Federal Reserve col leagues and I appropriately did to start bringing down inflation."
" The Federal Open Market Committee raised interest rates more quickly than it had in more than forty years, and I think the progress we have made on inflation shows how important it was to act so urgently."
" Just as importantly, excluding those prices  would have neglected how much hardship this high inflation has been  for many people, especially lower -income individuals and families."
" High inflation is a very different experience when you are e ffectively paying a higher rate than others, when a higher share of your expenses and income are spent on necessities, and when you have little in savings to draw on, as lower -income people do."
" When I talk about how important it is to win this inflation f ight, it is  partly in recognition of this inescapable reality for many millions of people."
  An important factor has been the Federal Reserve’s ongoing fight to lower inflation through tighter monetary policy.
" And, it might be a long fight, with interest rates higher for longer than some are currently expecting."
