"Wealth across Households  Let us start by taking a look at how the wealth of middle -income households  has evolved over recent years.6  Over the past three decades, the wealth of middleincome households increased an average of about 1 percent per year, adjusted for inflation (figure 1).7  That compares with average annual growth of 2.6 percent in real gross domestic income over this per iod."
" On average, households at all levels of income lost wealth as a result of the declines in asset prices and rise in unemployment during the crisis (figure 2)."
" Having sketched out the contours of the overall level and growth of wealth owned by middle -income households, let  us now turn to economic security ."
" In part, the growth in pension balances reflects the sustained decrease in longterm interest rates over this period, which has boosted the value of the future fixed payments associated with defined benefit pensions."
 How do we square the growth in pension assets with survey evidence indicating  that many households in the middle of the income distribution are concern ed that they will not have enough to live on in retirement?
 The gap between the relative growth of liabilities and assets peaked during the financial crisis and has narrowed somewhat for middle -income households more recently.
  The rapid growth in liabilities reflects both short -term cash flow management  and longer -term investments.
" From 2007 to 2018, the share of income spent on rent rose from 18 percent to 25 percent for middle -income renters.26  Many middle -income families struggle to afford rent, particularly in the high -demand areas where jobs are most available, underscoring the need for more workforce housing."
" Graduates with a bachelor’s degree have median weekly  earnings that are about 65 percent higher than high school graduates  and unemployment rates that are 2 percentage points lower,  and they are often better position ed to adapt to changes in the labor market.30   However, the cost of higher education  has been rising, placing  an increasing  financial burden on many  middle -income  households."
" Total student loan debt, in inflationadjusted terms, more than doubled from 2006 to 2018 (figure 11).34  Repayment of student loans can be challen ging."
" One study found that individuals with student loan debt are less likely to start a business, and thos e who do are more likely to fall behind on their loan payments.38  Another study found that growth in student loan debt resulted in a 14 percent reduction in small business formation in counties over a 10year period.39                                                  36 See Alvaro Mezza, Daniel Ringo, and Kamila Sommer (2019), “ Can Student Loan Debt Explain Low Homeownership Rates for Young Adults?"
"  In inflation -adjusted terms, total business assets (including corporate stocks, mutual funds, and unincorporated businesses ) have more than tripled since 1989 ."
" - 18 - Maximum  Employment, Wages , and Wealth  With lower net worth and financial assets, the livelihoods of most middle -income families , other than retirees,  depend primarily on compensation from working."
" The Congress put maximum employment right at the heart of the Federal  Reserve’s mandate, alongside price stability."
" In fact, we are one of only a ha ndful of  central banks that ha ve the explicit  responsibility to promote maximum employment."
" Given that households at the middle of the income distribution rely primarily on wage income, our full employment mandate has served the country well during this extended recovery."
 Unemployment is now at 3.6 percent —its lowest level in 50 years.
" Employment rates of adults in their prime working years (ages 25 to 54) have been rising steadily during the expansion and recently reached their pre -recession p eak of 80 percent.42  Importantly, wage growth has begun to pick up after years of slow gains."
"  - 19 - stabilized in early 2009, middle -income households did not see their wealth begin to recover until 2010, when the unemployment rate began to decline (figure 13)."
"  Even as we welcome the many benefits of the current strong job market, longer -term trends raise concerns."
" The unemployment rate of blacks, while near its historical low,  remains at about 7 percent, twice the unemployment rate of whites."

 Earnings have declined as the job market has shifted away from important middle -income occupations.
"  Monetary policy aims to influence employment and inflation over the business cycle, as opposed to addressing thes e longer -run structural changes."
" But  the distribution of income and wealth may have important implications for macroeconomic developments, such as the evolution of consumption, which is the single biggest engine of growth in our  economy."
"  Recent research finds that households with lower levels of wealth spend a larger fraction of any income gains than households with higher leve ls of wealth.46  Consequently, an economy that delivers an increasing share of income  gains to highwealth households could result in less growth in consumer demand than one in which the gains are distributed more equally."
