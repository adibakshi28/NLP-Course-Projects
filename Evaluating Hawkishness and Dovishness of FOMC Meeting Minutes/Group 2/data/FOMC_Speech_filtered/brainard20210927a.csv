"  Indeed, Delta disrupted both demand and supply."
" Single -family home construction permits declined again in August for the third consecutive month despite very strong housing demand, as builders faced shortages of materials."
"All told , private sector forecast ers have revised down growth projections for 2021 over recent months by slightly  more than 1 percentage point  on average .3  Even with this  Delta  downgrade, I anticipate that growth this year and next will be sufficient such that by the end of next year, average annual growth since the onset of the crisis should exceed  precrisis  trend growth.4  The strength of the  recovery despite the unprecedented challenges associated with COVID reflects powerful fiscal and monetary support and the resilience of American workers, businesses, and households."
 Delta  has also  slow ed progress on employment .
" Payroll gains in leisure a nd hospitality unexpectedly fell to zero in August following average monthly gains of  3 For example, between the June and September publications of the Blue Chip Economic Indicators survey, the consensus estimate for real GDP growth in 2021 fell from 6.7 percent to 5.9 percent."
" 4 The median real GDP Q4/Q4 growth rates in the SEP of 5.9 percent for 2021 and 3.8 percent for 2022 imply an annualized growth rate from the fourth quarter of 2019 through the fourth quarter of 2022 of 2.4 percent, above t he median SEP estimate of the long -run real GDP growth rate of 1.8 percent and above the top of the interquartile range of estimates from the most recent Survey of Primary Dealers by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York."
"  As of the end of August , payroll employment remains over 5 million below pre -COVID levels and nea rly 8½ million below where it would have been in the absence of COVID."
 Roughly one -third  of the gap to pre -COVID employment levels is concentrated in the frontline leisure and hospitality sector.
"  While the  headline unemployment rate declined to 5.2 perc ent in August , the unemployment rate adjusted for COVID -related nonparticipation remained elevated at 7.5 percent.5  The employment -topopulation (EPOP)  ratio for prime -age workers stood at 78 percent in August —2.4 percentage points below its pre -COVID level .6   So overall, t he labor market is making progress , although at a slower pace than earlier in the year .7  Relative to December, payrolls have closed nearly 50 percent of their  5 This alternative measure adjusts for the misclassification of some unemployed workers as employed but not at work (as reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics) and for diminished labor force participation induced by the pandemic (as  estimated by the Federal Reserve Board staff) ."
" Like the U -3 unemployment rate provided by the BLS , the adjusted rate is also at a post -pandemic low."
"  Some observers argue that labor force  participation has moved permanently lower, and the  labor market is already tight, such that we should not expect a return to pre -COVID employment conditions."
" For instance, t he number of respondents to the Census Household Pulse Survey indicating they were not working due to either being sick with COVID or caring for someone sick with COVID more than doubled between lat e July and early September, returning to levels seen early this year.9   While I am hopeful for improvements in the September employment report with the return to in -person education, the effects of Delta have likely prolonged caregiving constraints."
" For example, through last week there had been just over 2 ,000 school closures  for COVID across nearly 470 school districts in 39 states.10* While the   8 The gap of payroll employment to pre -COVID trends is the gap between the current level of payroll employment and the level that would have occurred had total nonfarm payrolls grown at a constant rate of 168,000 per month (the average growth rate in 2019) beginning in March 2020."
" For example, the unemployment rate was 3.5 percent in February 2020 and 6.7 percent in December 2020, a gap of 3.2 percentage points."
" In August, the unemployment rate was 5.2 percent, implying a gap to pre -COVID conditions in this metric of 1.7 percentage points, meaning that a little under 50 percent of the 3.2 percentage point gap that existed in December 2020 had been closed by August 2021."
" Simi larly, COVIDrelated challenges  have reduced the availability of day care, preschool, and after -school care, further complicating parental return -towork decisions.11  Research has shown that the pandemic has taken a significant toll on the labor market status of many mothers, particular ly Black and Hispanic mothers, mothers with younger children, and mothers with lower incomes.12   With record -high job openings and an unemployment rate just above 5 percent, the headline  vacancy -tounemployed (V/U) ratio has risen above 1 vacancy  per job seeker and is now at  prepandemic levels."
 S ome cite this ratio  of job openings to job seekers as indicating we are close to full employment.
" Although prime -age unemployment declined by less than half a percentage point  over this period , that modest  11 See, for example, Claire Cain Miller (2021), “‘Can’t Compete’:  Why Hiring for Child Care Is a Huge Struggle,” New York Times,  September 21, https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/21/upshot/child -care.html ."
" 12 Recent research found that women with very young children, who accounted for 10 percent of the pre -pandemic workforce, accounted for almost onefourth  of the unanticipated  decline in employment  during the pandemic."
" Therefore, it is more informative  to rely on a V/U ratio that adjusts the unemployment rate for pandemic -related  nonparticipation and misclassification."
" After adjusting for pandemic -related nonparticipation, the  ratio of job openings to job seekers was about 0.85 in July—nearly onethird below the headline ratio —and similar to levels last seen between 2014 and 2016—suggesting there is ample room for a full recovery in employment .13 The assertion that labor force participation has moved permanently lower as a result of a downturn is not new ."
 Research demonstrates that the labor force participation rate cycle lags that of the unemployment rate by years.
" So , it is important to  consider indicators beyond the headline unemployment rate when assessing progress  toward maximum employment , as participation gains might come late in the recovery  for some groups .14   13 The number of unemployed in this alternative V/U ratio adjusts for the misclassification of some unemployed workers as employed but not at work (as reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics) and for diminished labor force participation induced by the pandemic (as estimated by the Federal Reserve Board staff)."

"  - 7 -  For these reasons, I see no reason  employment should not reach  levels as strong or stronger than before the  pandemic."
 Inflation is currently elevated.
 But the h igh inflation readings from the spring and early summer were disproportionately driven by a few sectors experiencing specific supply bottlenecks.
" In May and June, new and used vehicle prices accounted for half of the outsized  monthly increases in core consumer price index ( CPI) inflation."
 I am closely monitoring incoming data for any indicat ions that the breadth of inflation pressures is rising.
" Twenty -fourmonth core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation provides one approach to smoothing through the distortions from the pandemic :  It is estimated to have been 2.5 percent in August, above the 2 percent target, but well below the 12month measure."
 The Dallas trimmed mean inflation measure provides another indicator of the breadth of inflation pressures :  It came in at 2.0 percent  in July—well below the 12month measure of core PCE inflation .15   The currently elevated level of inflation is driven by COVID -related disruptions.
" As these COVIDrelated disruptions subside , most forecasters expect inflation  to move back down toward the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent long -run objective on its own."
 That is the sense in which currently high inflation is likely to be transitory.
"  So, I expect  inflation to decelerate, and pre -COVID inflation dynamics  to return  when COVID disruptions dissipate ."
" But with  Delta disrupting the rotation from goods to services and prolonging supply bottlenecks, it is u ncertain just how fast and how much inflation will decelerate over the remainder of the year and into next year."
" First, while rent and owners’ equivalent rent both rose a moderate 0.3 percent in the August CPI data, if housing services inflation moved up substantially more than expected, it could provide durable upward pressure on inflation."
" Second, there is a risk that goods prices may not decelerate and return to pre -COVID trends as is  widely expected, for instance , if excess savings or disruptions to services result in persistently  elevated goods demand."
" Third, I will be watching for any signs that  wage  gains are feeding into  higher inflation more broadly, but t he evidence so far suggest s that wage gains are broadly in line with  productivity growth, and the labor share of income remains low relative to historical levels ."
" To date , high m arkups and nonwage input costs appear to be more notable contributors  to inflation than wage pressures."
" Finally, I am vigilant for any signs that the current high level of  inflation might  push longer -term inflation expectations above levels consistent with our 2 percent inflation objective."
 Market -based measures of inflation compensation suggest inflation expectations remain well anchored.
" For instance,  the five -year, five -yearforward  CPI inflation compensation measure based on Trea sury Inflation -Protected Securities has  - 9 -  remained range bound around 2.2 percent since declining about 0.2 percent age point  in June—consistent with the FOMC’s 2 percent objective for PCE inflation .16   Surveybased measures also suggest longer -run expectati ons remain well anchored."
" R ecent analysis of the Survey of Consumer Expectations (SCE) concludes that “in August 2021 consumers’ five -year ahead inflation expectations were as well anchored as they were two years ago, before the start of the pandemic.”17  Longer -term inflation expectations in the University of Michigan S urvey  of Consumers  have moved mostly sideways in the past four to five months , and the current reading of the Federal Reserve Board index of common inflation expectations remains well within the range that prevailed before  2014."
" While one -year ahead measures in the SCE and the Michigan survey have seen large increases, these short -term measures tend to move with consumers’ exper ience of contemporaneous inflation."
" Partly as a result, employment gains flatlined in August in the leisure and hospitality sector , where many of t he job losses have occurred."
"   16 The TIPS measure is based on CPI inflation, which generally runs a bit above PCE inflation."

  - 10 -  Payroll employment is now between 5 and 8½ million short of where it would be in the absen ce of the pandemic .
 The unemployment rate adjusted for pandemic -related nonparticipation is 7.5 percent.
"While inflation has been well above target for the past six months, affecting consumers and businesses alike,  it previously spent roughly a quarter century below 2 percent ."
" There are good reasons to expect a  return to pre -COVID inflation dynamics due to the underlying structural features of a relatively flat Phil lips curve, low equilibrium interest rates, and low underlying trend inflation."
" While the playbook for guiding inflation back down to target following a moderate overshoot is w ell tested  and effective, experience suggests it is  difficult to guide inflation up to target from below."
 The  forward guidance on maximum employm ent and average inflation set s a much higher bar  for the liftoff of the policy rate  than for slowing the pace of asset purchases.
" In implementing policy step by step, we must  remain faithful to our new framework and attentive to changing conditions in order to ensure sufficient momentum as fiscal tailwinds  shift to headwinds to achieve  our maximum employment and inflation goals ."
