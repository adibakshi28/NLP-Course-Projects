"For release on delivery  4:30 p.m. EDT ( 3:30 p.m. CDT)  April 3, 2024          The Outlook for the U.S. Economy and Monetary Policy     Remarks by   Adriana D."
 The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has been working to lower inflation in the context of our dual mandate  of maximum employment and price stability.
 Today I will discuss economic developments in the U.S. and how I view the current stance of monetary policy in light of recent data and longer -run trends.
" Since I am an economist, you will not be surprise d that I will talk about recent economic developments by highlighting the dynamics of supply and demand."
" As you all know, inflation began to rise in 2021."
" By mid -2022, 12 -month inflation, based on  the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index , was around 7 percent —much too high and far  above the FOMC’s 2 percent longer -run objective ."
" But since that time, PCE inflation has slowed significantly , declining  to 5.4 percent at the end of 2022 , then to 2.6 percent at the end of 2023 , and then to  2.5 percent in February."
 Inflation can sometimes be hard  to read from overall PCE inflation figures due to the volatility of food and energy prices.
" For that reason, it is sometimes helpful to focus on “core” PCE inflation, which excludes those categories  and is a better guide to the direction of inflation ."
 Core PCE inflation peaked at a rate above 5 -1/2 percent in early 2022 but fell rapidly during 2023 .
" In fact, the core PCE disinflation we saw last year was the fastest since the early 1980s."
"  - 2 - month, and , indeed, January and February of this year showed a bit of firming in the inflation data."
" I like to think about core PCE inflation in terms of three main components : goods, housing services, and nonhousing services."
" Twelve -month inflation for core goods peaked first, reaching about 7 -1/2 percent in early 2022."
" But g oods inflation cooled quickly, and in February goods prices were nearly half a percent age point  below their level  a year ago ."
 Services inflation peaked later and has cooled less quickly.
" Housing services inflation is naturally persistent because tenant rents often have year -long lease agreements, and estimates of owner -occupied  housing costs are imputed based in large part using those tenant rents."
 Data on new tenant rent agreements suggest that housing inflation broadly will continue to cool.
" Finally, inflation in core non -housing services hovered between 4 -1/2 and 5 -1/2 percent from mid -2021 through mid2023 but began cooling after that , reaching 3."
  Continued disinflation will indeed require further progress in housing and non -housing services.
 The rise  and subsequent easing of inflation in recent years w ere related to both supply and demand factors.
" Roughly speaking, if a price goes up while quantity goes down, that is a n  - 3 - indication that a  negative supply shock  is dominating ; if price and quantity move in the same direction, that is an indication that a demand shock  is dominating ."
" Research  using this method  finds that , for the economy broadly,  demand shocks account ed for roughly twothirds of the 2021 pickup in, and 2023 slowing of , core PCE inflation, with the remaining one -third related to  supply."
 The role of supply is somewhat larger in a narrower analysis focused on the domestic manufacturing sector.2  “Top -down” research looking at aggregate time -series data also found significant contributions for both supply and demand factors.3 Let me be a bit more concrete about this point by discussing supply and demand for goods and services in turn.
 Businesses frequently highlighted shortages of materials as having held down production  during the period when supply was tight  and demand was strong .
" Supply chains and production have largely recovered, and there  are signs that goods demand growth since then has eased."
" For example, the share of  2 For explaining core PCE inflation generally, s ee Adam Hale Shapiro (2022), “Decomposing Supply and Demand Driven Inflation,” Working Paper Series 2022 -18 (San Francisco:  Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, October; revised February 2024), available at https://doi.org/10.24148/wp2022 -18."
 That research  found a roughly 50 –50 split between supply and demand.

" Regarding  services , particularly non -housing services , the most important input to services production tends to be labor.4  For that reason, it is useful to talk about supply and demand for labor."
"  If the CBO analysis is correct, population growth has been a sizable contributor to overall labor force g rowth ."
"On the demand side, labor demand was strong in 2021 and 2022 ."
" Demand was so strong, in fact, that the job opening s rate—that is, the monthly number of job openings relative to total employment —ran almost  50 percent above its pre -pandemic record all the way from July 2021 through July 2022.6   But the job opening s rate has declined roughly 30 percent from its peak, a sign that labor demand —while still robust —has cooled significantly."
" Importantly, given the strong labor supply growth, supply –demand imbalances can continue to ease even amid a solid pace of net job growth, as we have been seeing."
" Indeed, I suspect that strong population growth  helps resolve the puzzle that forecasters have faced over the past year, in which measures of labor market growth —and growth of  5 For example, one popular measure of “matching efficiency” shows an initial decline early in the pandemic but a robust recovery to pre -pandemic levels."
"   - 6 - other economic variables, like consumption —have been solid even amid easing inflation.7 As labor markets have moved into better balance, wage growth has cooled —which means that increases in the main cost business in the services sector  have slowed, easing inflationary pressures ."
 Workers and families do not reap the benefit of higher wage s if those gains are eaten up by inflation .
" For that reason, it is important that wage growth be consistent with 2 percent inflation over time."
" The U.S. economy is  moving back toward that kind of wage growth , including in services industries :  The 12 -month growth of average hourly earnings in private services has come down to about 4 percent from a peak pace above 6 percent in early 2022."
" And d espite the cooling of wage growth, with inflation easing  over the past year , we have seen broader wage increases  again outpacing price gains , that is, real wage gains ."
"  While supply conditions are beyond the control of monetary policymakers, the FOMC  can influence the pace of inflation by tightening monetary policy to slow the growth of aggregate demand."
 The FOMC began raising its policy interest rate in early 2022 and proceeded expeditiously.
" These actions have damped aggregate demand, with the most pronounced effects on interest rate –sensitive sectors."
" And  business investment in  machines has seen somewhat tepid growth  7 For an analysis of the implications of CBO population estimates for labor markets and consumer spending, see Wendy Edelberg and Tara Watson (2024), “New Immigration Estimates Help Make Sense of the Pace of Employment” (Washington:  Hamilton Project , Brookings Institution , March 7), available a t https://www.brookings.edu/articles/new -immigration -estimates -helpmake -sense -ofthe-paceof-employment ."
" More broadly, financial conditions have been a drag on aggregate demand, as suggested by the Federal Reserve Board’s FCI -G (Financial Conditions Impulse on Growth) index , which estimates the overall effect on gross domestic product (GDP ) of changes in financial conditions , including interest rates, asset p rices, and exchange rates."
" In addition to the direct action s taken to tighten monetary policy , the FOMC  has also helped cool inflation through its communication with the public."
" In particular, the FOMC ’s stated commitment to bring inflation back to 2 percent , coupled with its actions to tighten policy,  has helped ensure  that longer -term inflation expectations remain anchored —that is, that households and firms believe that inflation will return to the Committee’s  target."
" Separately, a  Richmond Fed survey shows a close relation between firms’ expectations of overall inflation and their own price -setting plans ."
" As the effects of earlier supply and demand shocks fade, firms  with anchored inflation expectations  will bring their price -setting decisions back into alignment with the FOMC’s inflation target."
" Before  the pandemic, the typical price lasted more than 10 months, but by early 2022 , it was lasting fewer than 5 months  while inflation was near its recent peak ."
" Given my thinking about the role of supply and demand in recent inflation dynamics, as well as the role anchored inflation expectations are playing in bringing price -setting behavior back to normal, I expect the disinflationary trend to continue."
" There is still a bit of room for further supply improvement, especially in the services sector , where solid labor supply growth will continue to ease wage and inflation pressures."
"  On the demand side , I expect consumption growth to slow some this year, as households have drawn down large balances of excess savings accumulated during the pandemic and are facing restrictive financial conditions."
" We may already be seeing some of that slowing; consumer spending  was soft in January and February , on average , suggesting that we are on track for lower consumption growth in the first quarter than we saw during the second half of last year."
" With less support from consumers, I expect GDP growth this year to be solid but slower than last year’s strong 3.1 percent pace."
" Even with demand growth cooling, given the backdrop of solid supply , my baseline expectation is that further disinflation can be accomplished without a significant rise in unemployment."
" That said, the future is uncertain, and I am attentive to risks —both upside risks to my inflation outlook and downside risks to the outlook for economic activity."
" Additionally, consumption growth could turn out to be stronger than expected, particularly because of the wage gains we have seen across all income groups —but especially among the l owest earners who have an especially high propensity to spend out of their income.9  Indeed, consumption was surprisingly strong last year and made solid contributions to GDP growth in the third and fourth quarters , though some of that strength may have been related to strong population growth  which , more generally,  was likely disinflationary ."
  But there are also downside risks to economic activity.
" The February employment report featured a rise in the unemployment rate, half of which was accounted for by layoffs."
"  9 Since the pandemic, workers at the low end of the wage distribution have seen the strongest wage growth , which  is apparent in the Atlanta Fed’s Wage Growth Tracker."
" For a discussion, see the recent Monetary Policy Report :  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2024), Monetary Policy Report  (Washington:  Board of Governors, March ), https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/20240301_mprfullreport.pdf ."
" - 10 - Finally, let me briefly discuss monetary policy."
" As I have noted, policy is currently restrictive, and my baseline expectation is that disinflation will continue without a broad economic slowdown —though such an outcome is not assured ."
"  In considering the appropriate path of monetary policy, I am guided by the FOMC’s dual mandate  of maximum employment and price stability ."
" After the March FOMC meeting, the Committee said that it “does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent.”10  After that meeting , we also published the Summary of Economic Projections, which summarizes the forecasts of FOMC participants."
" My own expectation is consistent with that; if disinflation and labor market conditions  proceed as I am currently expecting , then some lowering of the policy rate this year would be appropriate."
