 One of my main fields of inquiry was monetary policy theory.
" The Federal Reserve took a host of actions, including lowering its policy rate to zero and purchasing securities to support market functioning and provide monetary accommodation.2  The Congress enacted several packages that funded the health response to the pandemic, expanded unemployment insurance, and provided economic assistance payments to households and businesses.3 The virus also created uncertainty and turbulence in financial markets, which led  the Federal Reserve to establ ish emergency lending programs to serve as lending backstops and support the flow of credit to households, businesses, nonprofits, and state and local governments.4  Establishing these programs under s ection 13(3) of the Federal  1 I am grateful to Jane Ihrig for assistance in preparing these remarks."
" Because of  the large fiscal deficits  and rising federal debt, a narrative has emerged that the Federal Reserve will succumb to pr essures (1) to keep interest rates low to help service the debt and (2) to maintain asset purchases to help finance the federal government."
 My colleagues and I will continue to act solely to fulfill our congressionally mandated goals of maximum employment and price stability .
" The F ederal Open  Market Committee (FOMC)  determines the appropriate monetary policy actions solely to move  5 See Congressional Budget Office (2020), The Effects of Pandemic -Related Legislation on Output (Washington:  CBO, September), available at https://www.cbo.gov/publication/56537 ; Congressional Budget Office (2021), “Summary Estimate for Divisions M through FF, H.R. 133, Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, Publ ic Law 116 -260, Enacted on December 27, 2020,” January 14, https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/202101/PL_116260_Summary.pdf ; and Congressional Budget Office (2021), “Estimated Budgetary Effects of H.R. 1319, American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, As passed by the Senate on March 6, 2021,” summary tables, March 10, https://ww w.cbo.gov/system/files/202103/Estimated_Budgetary_Effects_of_HR_1319_as_passed_0.pdf ."
 Deficit financing and debt servicing issues play no role in our policy decisions  and never will .
" To understand this point, consider a situation where the economy is hit with a negative shock that depresses aggregate demand."
 The Macro 101 textbook policy response we teach students is for the monetary and fiscal authorit ies to enact stimulative policies to increase aggregate demand.
"  This effort involves fiscal actions, such as increas ing spending and cutting taxes, which increase the deficit."
 The finance ministry’s job is to finance the deficit that results from these fiscal policy actions.
" Greater borrowing by the finance ministry  to finance these policies will tend to put upward pressure on interest rates, which crowds out private sector spending."
" In this textbook example, t he monetary authority should respond to this upward pressure on interest rates by adopting a more accommoda tive policy stance to bring rates back down."
 One obvious solution would be to give the finance ministry control of monetary policy t o ensure a coordinated policy response.
"   - 6 - In the situation where monetary policy is under control of the Treasury, and thus the executive branch in the U nited States , political motivations may influence decisions."
" To return  to my stabilization example, as the economy recovers, with all of the monetary and fisc al stimulus in place, this stimulus may lead to undesirable inflation pressures."
  The standard monetary policy response is to evaluate the current employment and inflation situations  and raise interest rates when deemed appropriate.
" However, if monetary policy is under the control of the Treasury, then to further juice the economy for short -term political gains, this action could be delayed past the date the central bank would want to raise rates."
" Consequently, the argument goes that a hot economy may cause substantial inflation pressures that are hard to rein in politically, and which ultimately harm Americans in the longer run."
" This view is backed up by the political economy literature, which argues that having monetary policy under the control of political authorities may lead to excessive inflation and economic volatility that is not socially optimal.11  Put another way, it can lead to an unstable economy, on which households and businesses cannot rely."
"Gordon (1983), “A Positive Theory of Monetary Policy in a Natural Rate Model,” Journal of Political Economy,  vol."
"Waller (1989), “Monetary Policy Games and Central Bank Politics,” Journal of Money, Credit and Banking,  vol."
" O perational independence with clearly specified goals for monetary policy has become the norm for central banks in advanced economies, reflecting the consensus that has emerged over the past 30 years concerning the benefits of central bank independence."
" The Congress was fully aware of the potential misuse of monetary policy for political reasons, and it purposefully created the Federal Reserve as an independent central bank."
" The design features of the Federal Res erve minimize political influence over monetary policy while still maintaining accountability to the Congress and to the electorate for its policy actions.13  Eventually, in 1977 , the Congress mandated that the Federal Reserve conduct monetary policy to ef fectively promote the goals of maximum employment and price stability ."
" By having monetary policy overseen by independent officials, the incentive to misuse stabilization policy for partisan purposes is reduced."
 Monetary policymakers can focus on what is best for the economy over the long run.14  13 An example of a design feature of the Federal Reserve that balances accountability with independence to conduct monetary policy is the provision in the Federal Reserve Act that requires “open market” purchases and sales of Treasury securities (12 U.S.C. § 355).
" The requirement for purchases and sales to be in the open  market makes the Federal Reserve accountable for paying a market price, and, by preventing the Federal Reserve from purchasing directly from the Treasury, it supports the independence of the Federal Reserve in the implementation of monetary policy."
 Money earmarked to make interest payments could be used for other purposes if interest rates were lower.
"  Thus, the fiscal authority has a strong incentive to keep interest rates  low."
" So the U.S. government ran up a substantial amount of debt to fund the war effort in a low interest rate environment, allowing the Treasury to have low debt servicing costs."
" After t he war was over and victory was achieved, the Treasury still had a large stock of debt to manage and still had control over interest rates."
" The postwar boom in consumption, along with excessively low interest rates, led to a bur st of inflation."
" Without control over interest rates, the Federal Rese rve could not enact the appropriate interest rate policies to rein in inflation."
" - 9 - and efforts by thenChair Thomas McCabe and then -Board member Eccles, ultimately led to the Treasury -Fed Accord of 1951, which restored interest rate policy to the Federal Reserve."
" The purpose of the accord was to ensure t hat interest rate policy  would be implemented to ensure the proper functioning of the economy, not to make debt financing cheap for the U.S. government."
" But research shows that, to avoid distortions in using monetary policy for deficit financing, it is important to have an independent central bank with a clear and credible inflation target , which the Federal Res erve does .17  Central bank independence is critical for maintaining that target and keeping inflation expectations in line with that target."
"Martin (2015), “Debt, Inflation and Central Bank Independence,” European Economic Review,  vol."
" In 2020, for example, the FOMC released a new S tatement o n Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy.19  This new framework explains how we interpret t he mandate that the Congress has given us and describes the broad framework that we believe will best promote our maximum -employment and price -stability goals."
" Going forward, the monetary policy choices of the FOMC  will continue to be guided solely by our  mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices ."
