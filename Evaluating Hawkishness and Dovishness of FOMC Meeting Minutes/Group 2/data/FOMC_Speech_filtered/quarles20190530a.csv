 I would like to use my time here to talk about a topic of interest to many central bankers and macroeconomists:  the interaction of monetary policy and financial stability.
" As you well know, monetary policy has powerful effects on financial markets, the financial system, and the broader economy."
" Conversely, financial instability, by impairing the provision of credit and other financial services, can depress economic growth, cause job losses , and push inflation too low."
" Accordingly, financial stability, through its effects on the Federal Reserve’s dual -mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices, must be a consideration in the setting of monetary policy."
"  Against this b ackdrop, a natural —yet quite complex—question is whether monetary policy should be used to promote  financial stability."
" At the same time, my sense is that the balance is clearly tilted toward the conclusion that macroprudential policies —throughthe-cycle resilience, stress tests, and the c ountercyclical capital buffer (CCyB) —may be better targeted to promot ing financi al stability than monetary policy.1   Before I wade into the lessons from past research and experience, I  woul d like to highlight that this question is not just academic."
" As you know, the economy, monetary policy, and financial stability are intertwined."
 These concerns highlight how cyclical factors influencing monetary policy borrowers may overlap with financial stability considerations.
  How M onetary P olicy Can Influence F inancial S tability    Let me begin by laying out how monetary policy can influe nce financial stability.
"  Monetary policy, operating primarily through adjustments in the level of short -term interest rates, has powerful effects on the entire financial system."
 A more accommodative monetary policy lowers interest rates across the maturi ty spectrum.
" The textbook result is that mortgage rates and corporate borrowing rates, among others, decline; equity prices rise; and the dollar exchange rate depreciates."
" In other words, financial conditions broadly ease, spurring households to buy more  and businesses to invest and hire, thereby supporting economic growth and price stability.2   Monetary policy, however, if too accommodative, may lead to a buildup of financial vulnerabilities."
" For                                                  2 For reviews of the various monetary policy transmission channels to the real economy , see Bernanke and Gertler (1995) and Boivin, Kiley , and Mishkin (2010) ."
"   - 3 - instance, low interest rates reduce the cost of borrowing, and so may prompt businesses and households to overborrow."
" Periods of excessive leverage, rapid credit growth, or buoyant credit  market sentiment increase the risk to economic growth.3   These dynamics point to the possibility that accommodative monetary policy, while necessary  to support activity during the early stages of an economic expansion, may also increase vulnerabilities in the financial system, especially if maintained for too long."
" These vulnerabilities weaken the financial system’s ability to absorb negative shocks, and so when a shock arrives, losses mount, the financial system weakens, lending slows, and economic activity slows by more than it would have otherwise, potentially leading to an economic downturn or a more severe recession."
These observations lead to the important question of whether and how financial vulnerabilities should affect the setting of monetary policy.
" One simple framework for evaluating the tradeoffs associated with acti vely setting monetary policy to lean against                                                  3 See, among others, Schularick and Taylor (2012 ); LópezSalido, Stein, and Zakrajsek (2017 ); Mia n, Sufi , and Verner (2017); Adrian, Boyarchenko, Giannone (2019 ); and Kiley (2018)."
 - 4 - the buildup of financial vulnerabilities is to examine the costs and benefits of such a policy in terms of unemployment and inflation.
" In this approach, the costs of tightening monetary policy in response to a buildup of financial vulnerabilities are lower employment and potentially below target inflation in the near term ."
" The benefits are possibly reducing the risk of a future financial crisis, an event likely associated with a much larger fall in employment and inflation ."
  One view is that monetary policy curbs household and business borrowing only modestly but can boost the unemployment rate notably.
 And so using monetary policy to damp borrowing does more harm than good.
" According to this view, using monetary policy to lean against  financial vulnerabilities does not generate significant net benefits and may be counterproductive —increasing unemployment and decreasing inflation below a desired level with little reduction in risks to financial stability .4   At the same time, some research has identified circumstances under which  the benefits of using monetary policy to lean against financial vulnerabilities could outweigh the costs."
"5  A key consideration is the estimated amount of economic activity lost in a financial crisis—and some research suggests such losses may be quite large, which raises  the benefits of leaning against imbalances."
" Similarly, monetary policy may affect a broad range of financial imbalances—excessively high house or equity prices and leverage within the financial sector—and the full set of these effects could shift the risk of financial instability sufficiently, at least under some circumstances, to make leaning against financial vulnerabilities with mon etary policy desirable."
  - 5 - we do not fully understand the cost –benefit tradeoff and whether monetary policy adjustments for financial stability reasons may be appropriate at some times.
" Of course, there is one additional and critical factor to consider when weighing adjustments to the stance of monetary policy for financial stability reasons :  the availability and efficacy of other instruments to promote financial stability."
" After all, the pursuit of multiple goals —full employment, price stability, and financial stability, for example —likely requires multiple tools."
" Second, regulation and macropudential tools can  reduce economic efficiency  and hamper  economic growth by limiting the ability of the market to allocate financial resources ."
" Furthermore, the CCyB might be a more effective tool than monetary policy to mitigate financial vulnerabilities, as the benefits are comparable to those of using monetary policy while the costs are an order of magnitude smaller."
"  Summary  To sum up, while there is evidence that financial vulnerabilities have the potent ial to translate into macroeconomic risks, a general consensus has emerged that monetary policy should be guided primarily by the outlook for unemployment and inflation and not by the state of financial vulnerabilities."
  There is a clear need for new theory and empirics to address the questions about monetary policy and financial s tability I  have posed today.
