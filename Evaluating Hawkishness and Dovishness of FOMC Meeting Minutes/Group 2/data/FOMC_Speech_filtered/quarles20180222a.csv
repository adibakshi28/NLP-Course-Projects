" After peaking  at 10  percent in October 2009, the unemployment rate fell  rather steadily to 4.1 percent in January --the lowest level , outside of a period from  1999 to 2000, since the 1960s."
" Job gains in recent months have continued at a pace that would be pushing the unemployment rate even lower if the labor participation rate had not stabilized in recent years , a welcome development and a sign that the strength of the labor market is pulling in or retaining workers who might otherwise be on the sidelines."
"  - 2 - While the labor market has shown steady improvement  over the past decade, the postcrisis performance of gross domestic product ( GDP ) growth has been more disappointing, averaging just 2 percent per year over the past seven  years ."
" However, beginning with t he second quarter of last year , growth has shown some momentum."
" While headline growth stepped back a bit in the  fourth quarter, largely on account of increas ed drag from higher imports and lower inventories , underlying final private domestic demand --which is a better indicator of economic momentum --grew at its fastest pace in more than  three years."
" The tax  and fiscal packages passed in recent months could help  sustain the economyâ€™s momentum in part by  increasing demand , and  also possibly by boosting the potential capacity of the economy by encouraging investment and supporting  labor force participation."
" While the recent performance of the economy has been solid relative to much of the pre -crisis period, one area that continues to lag is productivity growth, a condition that has been common across the advanced economies."
" Beginning in 2011, the annual growth  rate of labor productivity has averaged only 3/4 percent, compared with an  - 3 - average 2 -1/4 percent pace in the two decades leading up to the financial crisis."
 Why productivity growth has been so weak defies easy explanation.
" In addition, some have argued that there has been a decline in business dynamism following the crisis; others do not link the slowdown to the crisis but rather to an exogenous slowdown in the rate of technological progr ess; and still others believe that productivity growth has not really slowed much at all and, instead, is just not being measured correctly in the official statistics."
" Regardless, given the importance of productivity growth for the long -run potential of t he economy and living standards, it is vitally important that policymakers pursue policies aimed at boosting the growth rate of productivity."
      Another  aspect of the economy that has attracted a lot of attention is the apparent low level of inflation d espite the tightness in  labor markets.
" After a ssessing  the recent data, my take is that the current shortfall in inflation from target a s most likely due to transitory factors that will fade through 2018, pushing inflation back up to target."
" Against this economic backdrop, with a strong labor market and likely only temporary softness in inflation, I view it as appropriate that monetary policy should continue to be gradually normalized."
"   - 4 - With the balance sheet normalization plan set to remain on autopilot, barring a material deterioration in the economic outlook, the f ederal f unds rate remains our primary tool for adjusting the stance of monetary policy."
" At our January meeting, the F ederal Open M arket C ommittee  decided to maintain its target range for the federal funds rate between 1 -1/4 percent and 1 -1/2 percent.2  In this range, monetary policy remains accommodative."
 I anticipate further gradual increases in the policy rate will be appropriate to both sustain a healthy labor market and stabilize inflation around our 2 percent objective.
" Of course, it should go without saying that I will keep a c lose eye on economic indicators --and their implications for the outlook for inflation and real activity --and adjust my views on appropriate monetary policy accordingly."
