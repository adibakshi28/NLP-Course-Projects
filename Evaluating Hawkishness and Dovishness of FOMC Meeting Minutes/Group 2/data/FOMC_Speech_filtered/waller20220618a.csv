"Waller   Member     Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at  “Monetary Policy at a Crossroads ,” a panel discussion hosted by  the Dallas Society for Computational Economics         Dallas, Texas           June 18, 2022  Thank you, Meredith and Cullum and thank you to the Society for the invitation to speak  to you today."
" This week, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) took another significant step toward achieving our inflation objective  by raising the Federal Funds rate target by 75 basis points ."
" The Fed is “all in” on re -establishing price stability, and part of that effort involves understanding the forces that have boosted inflation and also examining  how policymakers responded."
" Today, I intend to look back on monetary policy in 2020 and 2021, as I have before in recent speeches, but go a bit f urther and try to discern some  lessons learned.1   In addition to the Federal Reserve’s emergency lending pr ograms , the monetary policy actions taken during this time were deemed extraordinary."
" Structural changes in the economy have tended to lower interest rates and limit the room that the Federal Reserve will have to cut rates during a slowdown.2  I hope we never have another two years like 2020 and 2021 , but because  of  1See Christopher J."

"  2  Research has suggested a large number of developments may have contributed to a decline in the equilibrium real interest rate, focusing on factors that may have shifted aggregate sa vings and/or investment    - 2 - the low -interestrate environment we now face, I believe that even in a typical recession there is a decent chance that we will be considering policy decisions in the future similar to those we made over the p ast two years."
" Besides  support ing smooth market functioning , asset  purchases also aided in the transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions."
" Over the course of 2020, the Fed’s liquidity and credit facilities saw reduced demand  and most of the emergency  in a manner that depresses the real interest rate required to equilibrate savings and investment."
" For example, lower trend economic growth likely lowers aggregate investment, while demographic factors such as an increase in life expectancy may increase s a vings."
" Other research has emphasized an increase in demand for safe assets among emerging market economies, which depresses interest rates in advanced economies."
"Future downturns a re unlikely to see the same global, sharp, a nd intense demand for liquidity, and thus not warrant the same kind of emergency lending."
" Perhaps the most straightforward takeaway for monetary policy is that in times of severe stress, lending facilities, along with sharp  cuts to the federal funds rate and the introduction of large -scale asset purchases , are very effective in reviving the economy."
" There are some other lessons, I think, from the experience of tightening monetary policy, a process which was put in motion by the guidance that the FOMC issued in 2020 about how long it would keep the federal funds rate at the effective lower bound and continue asset purchases."
" In September and December  of 2020, the F OMC  provided criteria or conditions in the meeting statement that would need to be met before the FOMC would consider rais ing interest rates and begin to reduc e asset purchases , respectively ."
  I mention this distinction because some have argued that the FOMC’s new strategy was a factor that led the Committee to wait too long to begin tightening monetary policy.
" In early 2021, the Committee began noting whether the economy was making progress toward our employment and inflation goals, and thus getting closer to decisions on unwinding our highly accommodative policy."
"   - 5 - For asset purchases, the Committee declared that tapering would wait “until substantial further progress has been made toward the Committee’s maximum employment and price stability goals.”4  Meanwhile, t he FOMC said that it would keep rates near zero until our employment goal  had been reached and until inflation had reached 2 percent and was “on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.”5   A fair question is: w hat did these words mean?"
" In November and December 2020, the u nemployment rate was 6.7 percent  and inflation seemed  to be in check : 12month personal consumption expenditures  inflation was declining, and  core inflation, which excludes volatile energy and food prices, was more or less steady at 1.5 percent."
"  The Summary of Economic Projections by FOMC participants in December 2020 had the unemployment rate moving down to 4.2 percent at the end of 2022 and  4 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2021), “Federal Reserve Issues FOMC Statement,” press release, June 16, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20210616a.htm   5 This phrase echoed a new detail in our monetary policy strategy that recognized the  12 years that inflation had run persistently below 2 percent and noted that as a  result, “appropriate monetary policy will likely a im to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time."
"” See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (202 0), “2020 Statement on Longer -Run Goals a nd Monetary Policy Strategy,” policy statement, August 27, https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/review -ofmonetary- policy -strategy -tools -a ndcommunications -statement -onlonger -rungoals -monetary -policy -strategy.htm ."
   - 6 - inflation moving up to 2 percent only in 2023 .
 Inflation averaging doesn’t define how much above 2 percent is moderate and how long some value of elevated inflation should be tolerated.
" Then, later that month, data indicated  inflation was  - 7 - accelerat ing, so the Committee hastened the pace of tapering  at the December  meeting , making a plan to wind  down purchases by early March ."
" Between December and March of this year inflation data came in very elevated, and  at that point there was  no question that inflation had been above 2 percent for “some time.”  Given continued improvement in the labor market and the high inflation readings , the Committee began raising interest rates  in March , as soon as asset purchases were completed ."
" However, i f we had less restrictive tapering criteria and had started tapering sooner , the Committee c ould have had more flexibility  on when to begin raising rates .6  So, by requiring substantial further progress toward maximum employment to even begin the process of tightening policy, one might argue that it locked the Committee into holding the policy rate at the zer o lower bound longer than was optimal."
 It can be argued that this meant getting the economy back to its 2019 state with very low unemployment and inflation near 2 percent .
"   In closing, I hope that our country is not faced with another crisis as severe as the one precipitated by COVID, and that the Fed is not faced with the challenges of setting monetary policy under such conditions."
