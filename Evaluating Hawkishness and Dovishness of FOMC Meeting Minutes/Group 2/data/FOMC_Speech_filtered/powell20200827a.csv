"For release on delivery  9:10 a.m. EDT (8:10 a.m. CDT)  August  27, 2020         New Economic Challenges and the Fed’s Monetary Policy Review     Remarks by  Jerome H."
"Powell   Chair   Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at  “Navigating the Decade Ahead:  Implications for Monetary Policy, ” an economic  policy symposium  sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City   Jackson Hole, Wyoming  (via webcast)         August 27, 2020   Thank you, Esther, for that introduction, and good morning."
" For the past year and a half, my colleagues and I on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) have been conducting the first -ever public review of our monetary policy framework.1  Earlier today we released a revised Statem ent on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, a document that lays out our goals, articulates our framework for  monetary policy, and serves as the foundation for our policy actions.2  Today I will discuss our review, the changes in the economy that  motivated us to undertake it, and our revised statement, which encapsulates the main conclusions of the review."
" Evolution of the Fed’s Monetary Policy Framework  We began this  public review in early 2019 to assess the monetary policy strategy, tools, and c ommunications that would best foster achievement of our congressionally assigned goals of maximum employment and price stability over the years ahead in service to the American people."
" Forty years ago, the biggest problem our economy faced was  high and rising inflation.3  The Great Inflation demanded  a clear  focus on restoring the                                                  1 See Board of Governors (2018) and Clarida (2019)."
 2 The revised Sta tement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy is available on the Board’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20200827a.htm .
"3 Consumer price inflation, which was running below 2 percent in the early 1960s, had risen into the double digits by the late 1970s and was slightly above 12 percent when the Committee gathered for an unscheduled meeting in the Eccles Building in Washington, D.C., on a Saturday in October 1979— before  - 2 - credibility of the FOM C’s commitment to price stability."
" Chair Paul  Volcker brought that focus to bear, and the “Volcker disinflation ,” with the continuing stewardship of Alan Greenspan, led to the stabilization of inflation and inflation expectations in the 1990s at around 2 percent."
 This new era brought new challenges to the conduct of monetary policy.
" Before the Great Moderation, expansions  typically ended in overheating and rising inflation."
" Since then, prior to the current pandemicinduced downturn, a series of historically long expansions had been more likely to end with episodes of financial instability, prompting essential efforts to substantially increase the strength and resilience of the financial system.4 By the early 2000s, many central banks around the world had adopted a monetary policy framework known as inflation targeting.5  Although the precise features of inflation targetin g differed from country to country, the core framework always articulated  an inflation goal as a primary objective of monetary policy."
 Inflation targeting was also associated with increased communication and transparency designed to clarify the central ba nk’s policy intentions .
 Inflation -targeting central banks generally do not focus solely on inflation:  Those with “flexible” inflation targets take into account economic stabilization in addition to their inflation objective.
                                                  the days when transparency was the hallmark of institutional accountability —and decided to change the conduct of monetary policy.
" 5 For a readable explanation of inflation targeting, see Bernanke and Mishkin (1997); also s ee Bernanke and others (1999)."
"  - 3 - Under Ben Bernanke’s leadership, the Federal Reserve adopted many of the features associated with flexible inflation targeting.6  We mad e great advances in transparency and communications, with the initiation of quarterly press conferences and the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), which comprises the individual economic forecasts of FOMC participants."
"  During that time, then –Board Vic e Chair Janet Yellen led an effort on behalf of the FOMC to codify the Committee’s approach to monetary policy."
" I n January 2012, the Committee issued its first Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, which we often refer to as the cons ensus statement ."
" A central part  of this statement was the articulation of a longer -run inflation goal of 2 percent.7  Because the structure of the labor market is strongly influenced by nonmonetary factors that can change over time, the Committee did not set a numerical  objective for maximum employment ."
" The 2012 statement was a significant milestone , reflecting lessons learned from  fightin g high inflation as well as from experience around the world with flexible inflation targeting ."
" Since then, our understanding of the economy                                                  6 For the formalization and development of the concept of flexible inflation targeting, see Svensson (1999) and, more recently, Svensson (2020) ."
  - 4 - has evolved in ways that are central to monetary policy.
" Of course, the conduct of monetary policy has also evolved."
 A key purpose of our review has been to take stock of the lessons learned over this period and identify any further changes in our moneta ry policy framework that could enhance our ability to achieve our  maximumemployment and price -stability objectives in the years ahead.9   Our evolving understanding of four key economic developments motivated our review .
" First , assessments of the potenti al, or longer -run, growth rate of the economy have declined."
" For example, since January 2012, the median estimate of potential growth from FOMC participants has fallen from 2.5 percent to 1.8 percent (see figure 1)."
" Some slowing in growth relative to ear lier decades was to be expected, reflecting slowing population growth and the aging of the population ."
" More troubling has been the decline in productivity growth, which is the primary driver of improving living standards over time.10 Second, the general le vel of interest rates  has fallen both here in the United States and around the world."
" Estimates of the neutral federal funds rate, which is the rate consistent  with the economy operating at full strength and with stable inflation, have fallen substantially, in large part reflect ing a fall in the equilibrium real interest rate, or “rstar.”  This rate is not affected by monetary policy but instead is driven by fundamental factors in the economy, including demographics and productivity growth —the same factor s that drive potential economic growth.11  The median estimate from                                                  9 On the benefits of holding a review, see Fuhrer and others (2018)."
 Fernald (2015) suggests 2003 as a break point for the beginning of the productivity slowdown.
" For evidence on the secular decline in interest rates in the United States and abroad see, for instance, Holston,  - 5 - FOMC participants of the neutral federal funds rate has fallen by nearly half since early 2012, from 4.25 percent to 2.5 percent (see figure 2)."
  This decline in assessments of the neutral federal funds rate has profound implications for monetary policy.
" With interest rates generally running closer to their effective lower bound even in good times, the Fed has less scope to support the economy during an economic downturn by simply cutting t he federal funds rate.12  The result can be worse economic outcomes in terms of both employment and price stability, with the costs of such outcomes likely falling hardest on those least able to bear them."
" The unemployment rate hovered near 50year lows for roughly 2 years , well below most estimates of its sustainable level ."
 And the unemployment rate captures only part  of the story.
" The B lack and Hispanic unemployment rates reached record lows, and the differentials between these rates and the white unemployment rate narrowed to their lowest levels on record .14  As we heard repeatedly in our Fed Listens events, the robust job market  was delivering  lifechanging gains for many individuals, families, and communities, particularly at the lower end of the income spectrum .15  In addition, many who had been left behi nd for too long were finding jobs, benefiting their families and communities, and increasing the productive capacity of our economy."
" I t is hard to overstate the benefi ts of sustaining a strong labor marke t, a key national goal that will require a range of policies in addition to supportive monetary policy."
" Fourth, the historically strong labor market  did not trigger a significant rise in inflation."
" Over the years , forecasts from FOMC participants and privatesector analysts routinely showed a return to 2 percent inflation, but these forecasts were never realized  on a sustained basis (see figure 3) ."
" Inflation forecasts are typically predicated on estimates  of the nat ural rate of unemployment , or “ ustar,” and of  how much upward pressure on inflation arises when the unemployment rate f alls relative to u -star.16  As the unemployment rate moved lower and inflation remained muted, estimates of u -star were revised down."
" For example, the median estimate from FOMC participants declined from                                                  14 The decline in the unemployment rate for African Americans has been particularly sizable, and its average rate in the second half of October 2019 was the lowest recorded since the data began to be reported in 1972; see Board of Governors (2020a)."
16 A discussion of various concepts of unemployment rate benchmarks that are frequently used by policymakers for assessing the current state of the economy is presented in Crump and others (2020).
" The muted responsiveness of inflation to labor market tightness, which we refer to as the flattening of the Phillips curve, also contributed to low inflation outcomes .17  In addition, longer -term inflation expectations, which we have long seen as  an important driver of actual inflation, and global disinflationary pressures may have been holding down inflation more than was generally anticipated."
 Other advanced economies have also struggled to achieve their inflation goals in recent decades.
 The persistent undershoot of inflation from our 2 percent longer -run objective is a cause for concern.
 Many find it counterintuitive th at the Fed would want to push up inflation.
" After all, low and stable inflation is essential for a wellfunctioning economy."
" However,  inflation that is persistently too low can pose serious risks to the economy."
" Inflation that runs below its desired level can lead to an unwelcome fall in longer -term in flation expectations, which, in turn, can pull actual inflation even lower, resulting in an adverse cycle of ever -lower inflation and inflation expectations."
This dynamic is a problem because expected inflation feeds directly into the general level of inte rest rates.
"  Well -anchored inflation expectations are critical for giving the Fed the latitude to support employment when necessary without destabilizing inflation.18  But if inflation expectations  fall below our 2 percent objective, interest rates                                                  17 See, for instance, Blanchard, Cerutti, and Summers (2015)."
 18 The success of monetary policy in taming high and variable inflation in the 1980s and 1990s was instrumental in anchoring inflation expectations at low levels.
" In turn, we would have less scope to cut interest rates to boost employment during an economic downturn, further diminish ing our capacity to stabilize the economy through cutting interest rates."
"  A clear takeaway from these events was the importance of achieving and sustaining a strong job market , particularly for people from low - and moderate -income communi ties."
" When we resumed our discussions last month, we turned our attention to distilling the most important lessons of the review in a revised  Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy."
"New Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy The federated structure of the Federal Reserve, reflected in the FOMC, ensures that we alway s have a diverse range of perspectives on monetary policy, and that is certainly the case today."
" Our                                                  20 The Federal Reserve System’s “Conference on Monetary Policy Strategy, Too ls, and Communication Practices (A Fed Listens  Event)” was hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago in June 2019."
"   - 10 - new consens us statement, like its predecessor, explains how we interpret the mandate Congress has given us and describes the broad framework that we believe will best promote our maximum -employment and price -stability goals."
" We continue to believe that specifying a numerical goal for employment is unwise, because the maximum level of employment is not directly measurable and changes over time for reasons unrelated to monet ary policy."
 The significant shifts in estimates of the natural rate of unemployment over the past decade reinforce this point.
" In addition, w e have not changed our view that a longer -run inflation rate of 2 percent is most consistent with our mandate to promote both maximum employment and price stability ."
" Finally, we continue to believe that monetary policy must be forward looking, taking into account the expectations of households and businesses and the lags in monetary policy’s effect on the economy."
 Our new statement explicitly acknowledges the challenges posed by the proximity of interest rates to the effective lower bound.
" By reducing our scope to support the economy by cutting interest rates, the lower  bound increases downward risks to employment and inflation.22  To counter these risks, we are prepared to use our full range of tools  to support the economy."
" - 11 - With regard to the employment side of our mandate, our revised statement emphasizes that maximum employment is a broad -based and inclusive goal."
" This change reflects our appreciation for the benefits of a strong labor market , particularly for many in lowand moderate -income communities .23  In addition, our revised statement says that our policy decision will be informed by our “assessments of the shortfalls  of employment from its maximum level” rather than by “ deviations  from its maximum level” as in our previous statement.24  This change may appear subtle, but it reflects our view that a robust job market can be sustained without causing an outbreak of inflation."
"In earlier decades when the Phillips curve was steeper, inflation tended to rise noticeably in response to a strengthening labor market."
 It was sometimes appropriate for the Fed to tighten monetary policy as employment rose toward its estimated maximum level in order to stave off an unwelcome rise in inflation.
" The change to “shortfalls” clarifies that, going forward, employment can run at or above real -time estimates of its maximum level without causing concern, unless accompanied by signs of unwanted increases in inflation or the emergence of other risks that could impede the attainment of our goals.25  Of course, when employment is below its maximum level, as is clearly the                                                  23 The analysis of how alternative strategies that succeed in reducing the frequency and/or severity of ELB recessions can induce longer run beneficial effects on economic inequality is presented in Feiveson  and others (2020) ."
" The 2012 statement noted that the Committee would mitigate “deviations” of employment from the Committee’s assessments of its maximum level, suggesting that the Committee would actively seek to lower employment if it assessed that employment was above the Committee’s estimate of its maximum level."
" 25 In addition, because real -time estimates are highly uncertain, we no longer refer to estimates of the natural rate of unemployment from the SEP in our consensus statement."
 Another reason for dropping this reference is that the unemployment rate does not adequately capture the full range of experience in the labor market.
" The SEP will continue to report FOMC participants’ estimates of the longer -run level of the unemployment rate, as such information remains a useful, albeit highly incomplete, input into our policy deliberations."
"  - 12 - case now, we will actively seek to minimize that shortfall by using our tools to support economic growth and job creation."
 Our longer -run goal continues to be an inflation rate of 2 percent.
 Our statement emphasizes that our actions to achieve both sides of our dual mandate will be most effective if longer -term inflation expectations re main well anchored at 2 percent.
" However, if inflation runs below 2 percent following economic downturns but never moves above 2 percent even when the economy is strong, then, over time, inflation will average less than 2  percent."
" Households and business es will come to expect this result, meaning that inflation expectations would tend to move below our inflation goal and pull realized inflation down."
" To prevent this outcome and the adverse dynamics that could ensue, our new statement indicates that we wi ll seek to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time."
" Therefore, following periods when inflatio n has been running below 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time."
" In se eking to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time, we are not tying ourselves to a particular mathematical formula that defines the average."
" Thus, our approach could be viewed as a flexible form of average inflation targeting.26  Our decisions a bout appropriate monetary policy will continue to reflect a broad array of considerations and will not be dictated by any formula."
" The literature has emphasized that the proximity of interest rates to the effective lower bound poses an a symmetric challenge for monetary policy, increasing the likelihood that inflation and employment will tend to be too low."
" An extensive discussion about how these issues affect the design of monetary policy, as well as the relevant related literature, can be found in Duarte and others (2020) , Arias and others (2020) , and Hebden and others (2020)."
"  - 13 - inflationary pressures were to build or inflation expectations were to ratchet above levels consistent with our goal, we would not hesitate to act."
 The revisions to our statement add up to a robust updating of our monetary policy framework.
" Overall, our new Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy conveys our continued strong commitment to achiev ing our goals , given the difficult challenges presented by the proximity of interes t rates to the effective lower bound."
" In conducting monetary policy, we will remain highly focused on fostering as strong a labor market as possible for  the benefit of all Americans."
" As our statement indicates, we plan to undertake a thorough public review of our monetary policy strategy, tools, and com munication practices roughly every five years."
