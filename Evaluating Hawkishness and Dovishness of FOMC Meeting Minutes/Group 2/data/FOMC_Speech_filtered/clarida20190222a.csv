"For release on delivery  Noon EST  February 22, 2019         The Federal Reserve’s Review of Its Monetary Policy  Strategy , Tools, and Communication Practices     Remarks by  Richard H."
"Clarida   Vice Chair   Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at the  2019 U.S. Monetary Policy Forum , sponsored by the Initiative on Global Markets at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business   New York, New York         February 22, 2019   I am pleased to participate in this year’s U.S. Monetary Policy Forum , which, since its inception, has brought together policymakers, academics, and market participants  to share ideas and perspectives on U.S. monetary policy."
" We will examine the policy strateg y, tools, and communication practices that we use to  pursu e our dual -mandate goals of maximum employment and price stability."
" In my remarks, I will describe the motivation f or and scope of this review and will preview some of the events we are planning as part of it.1  The U.S. Monetary Policy Forum is an excellent venue for this presentation."
" S imilarly , the Federal Reserve’s review of its monetary policy framework will be transparent, will be open minded, and will seek perspectives from a broad range of interested individuals and groups , including academics, other specialists, and the public at large ."
" Indeed, we believe our existing framework has served us well , help ing us effectively achieve our statutorily assigned dualmandate goals  of maximum employment and price stability ."
"  - 2 - communication practices to achieve and maintain these goals  as consiste ntly and robust ly as possible.2  I note that central banks in other countries have conduct ed periodic reviews of their monetary policy frameworks, and their experience has informed the approach we are pursu ing."
"economy operating at or close to our maximum -employment and price -stability  goals , now is an especially opportune time to conduct this review."
" The unemployment rate is near  a multidecade low , and inflation is running close to our 2 percent objective."
" The decline in neutral policy rates likely reflects several factors, including aging populat ions, changes in risk -taking behavior, and a slowdown in technology growth."
 All                                                  2 Fuhrer and others (2018) explore the desirability of comprehensive reviews of the monetary policy framework.
" That development, in tur n, could make it more difficult during downturns for  monetary policy  to support  spending and employment , and keep inflation from falling too low .4 Another key development in recent decades is that inflation appears less responsive to resource slack ."
" That is, the short -run Phillips curve appears to have flattened , implying a change in the dynamic relationship between inflation and employment.5  A flatter Phillips curve is, in a sense, a proverbial double -edged sword."
" It permits the Federal Reserve to support employment more aggressively during downturns --as was the case during and after the Great Recession --because a sustained inflation breakout is less likely when the  Phillips curve  is flatter .6  However, a flatter Phillips curve  also increases the cost, i n terms of economic output, of reversing unwelcome increases in longer -run inflation expectations ."
" Thus, a flatter Phillips curve makes it all the more  important that longer -run inflation expectations remain anchored at levels consistent with our  2 percen t inflation objective .7                                                  4 For assessments of the risks tha t U.S. monetary policy will be constrained by the ELB and its implications for economic activity and inflation, see Kiley and Roberts (2017), Erceg and others (2018), Swanson  (2018), and Chung and others (2019)."
"6 One potential contributor to the flattening of the Philli ps curve is a change in the conduct of monetary policy since the 1980s toward greater stabilization of inflation and economic activity; for evidence of such a change, see Clarida, Galí, and Gertler (2000);  Boivin and Giannoni (2006) ; and Boivin, Kiley, and  Mishkin (2010 )."
" Similarly, the adoption of an explicit inflation ob jective, along with greater certainty regarding the conduct of monetary policy, can help anchor longer -term inflation expectations and stabilize actual inflation in response to shocks."
 7 See Yellen (2015) for a discussion of inflation dynamics and monetary  policy ; see Erceg and others (2018) for a quantitative exploration of the monetary policy implications of a flat Phillips curve in an uncertain economic environment.
" Since the mid1980s, movements in both realized inflation and measures of longer -term in flation expectations have been somewhat muted, complicating the task of extracting the precise role of inflation expectations as a determinant of realized inflation."
" Faust and Wright (2013) review  - 4 - Scope of the Review  In the Federal Reserve Act, the Congress assigned the Federal Reserve the responsibility to conduct monetary policy “so as to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long -term interest rates.”8  Our review this year will take this statutory m andate as given and will also take as given that inflation at a rate  of 2 percent is most consistent over the longer run with the congressional  mandate."
"  Our existing monetary pol icy strategy is laid out in the Committee’s Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy.9  First adopted in January 2012, the statement has been reaffirmed at the start of each subsequent year, including at the FOMC’s meeting last month with unanimous support  from all 17 FOMC participants ."
 The statement indicates that  the Committee seeks to mitigate deviations of inflation from 2 percent and deviations of employment from assessments of its maximum level.
" In doing so, the FOMC recognizes tha t these assessments of maximum employment are necessarily uncertain and subject to revision."
" According to the Federal Reserve Act , the employment objective  is on an equal footing with the inflation objective."
                                                  the literature on inflation forecasting and present eviden ce in support of the conclusion that measures of inflation expectations help predict the trend in inflation.
" In a paper discussed at this forum two years ago, Cecchetti and others (2017) showed that while the level of realized inflation and four -quarter -ahead inflation expectations are positively correlated, changes in these variables have been largely uncorrelated since the mid -1980s."
" These authors suggest that, in a low and stable inflation environment, policymakers should pay attention to a wide array of other indicators in determining the implications of movements in realized inflation and measures of inflation expectations."
" 8 Even though the act lists three distinct goals, the Federal Reserve ’s mandate for monetary policy is commonly known as the “dua l mandate.”  The reason is that an economy in which people who want to work either have a job or are likely to find one fairly quickly and in which the price level (meaning a broad measure of the price of goods and services purchased by consumers) is stabl e creates the conditions needed for interest rates to settle at moderate levels."
" - 5 - As a practical matter, our current strategy sh ares many elements with the policy framework known in the research literature as  “flexible inflation targeting .”10  However, the Fed’s mandate is much more explicit about the role of employment than that of most flexible inflation -targeting central banks, a nd our statement reflects this by stating that when the two sides of the mandate are in conflict, neither one takes precedent over the other."
 We believe this transparency about the balanced approach the FOMC takes has served us well over the past decade w hen high unemployment called for extraordinary policies that entailed some risk of inflation.
" Three Questions  The first question is , “Can the Federal Reserve best meet its statutory  objectives with its existing monetary policy strategy, or should it consider strategies that aim to reverse past misses of the inflation objective?”  Under our c urrent approach as well as that of most  flexible inflation -target ing central banks around the world, the persistent shortfalls of inflation from 2  percent  that many advanced economies have  experienced over most of the past decade  are treated as “bygones .”  This mean s that policy today is not adjusted to offset past  inflation  shortfalls with future overshoots of the inflation target (nor do  persistent  overshoots of inflation trigger policies that aim to undershoot the inflation target)."
" Central banks are generally believed to have effective tools for preventing persistent inflation overshoots, but the                                                  10 For a discussion of this terminology and references, see English, López -Salido, and Tet low (2015) and Clinton and others (2015)."
  - 6 - effective lower bound on interest rates makes persistent undershoots more  likely.
" Persistent  inflation shortfalls  carry the risk  that longer -term inflation expectations become poorly anchored or become anchored below the stated inflation goal.11 In part because of that concern, some economists have advocated “makeup” strategies under which policymakers seek to undo, in part or in whole, past inflation deviations from target."
" Such strategies include targeting average inflation over a multiyear period and price -level targeting , in which policymakers seek to stabilize the price level around a constant growth path.12  These strategies could be implemented either permanent ly or as a temporary response to extraordinary circumstances."
"  For example, the central bank could commit, at the time when the policy rate reaches the ELB, to maintain the policy rate at this level until inflation over the ELB period has, on average, run at the target rate.13  Other makeup strategies seek to reverse shortfalls in policy accommodation at the ELB by keeping the policy rate lower for longer than                                                  11 These risks could be exacerbated if households and businesses expect monetary policy to be insufficiently accommodative because of proximity to the ELB."
 12 Eggertsson and Woodford (2003) provide an early discussion of how optimal monetary policy at the ELB entails a commitment to reflate the price level during the subsequent e conomic expansion.
 Nessén and Vestin (2005) discuss the relationship between average inflation targeting and price -level targeting.
 There is a dearth of empirical evidence on strategies seeking to make up for inflation deviations.
 Central banks that pur sue an inflation goal generally seek to achieve a specific rate of inflation by some time horizon --typically a couple years ahead or over the “medium run” --without regard to past inflation deviations.
" One exception is the Reserve Bank of Australia, whose inflation goal is specified as a range of “2 -3 per cent, on average, over the medium term” and thus might embed some notion of history dependence."
" However, Ruge -Murcia (2014) argues that the drift in the price level in Australia is comparable with the drifts observed in economies with purely forward -looking specification of the inflation goal."
 See also Kiley and Roberts (2017) for a strategy in which policymakers aim for inflation higher than 2 percent during  economic expansions to compensate for below -target realizations of inflation during economic downturns.
"  - 7 - otherwise  would be the case .14  In many models that incorporate  the ELB, these makeup strategies lead to better average performance on both legs of the dual mandate and thereby, viewed over time, provide no conflict between the dual -mandate goals.15 The benefits of the makeup strategies rest heavily on households and f irms believing in advance that the makeup will, in fact, be delivered when the time comes --for example, that a persistent inflation shortfall will be met by future inflation above 2 percent."
"  As is well known from the research  literature, makeup strategies , in general , are not time consistent  because when the time comes to push inflation above 2 percent, conditions at that time will not warrant doing so ."
"  The next question the review will consider is , “Are the existing monetary policy tools adequate to achieve and maintain maximum employment and price stability, or should the toolkit be expanded?"
" And, if so, how?”  The FOMC’s primary means of changing the stance of monetary policy is by adjusting its targe t range for the federal  funds rate."
" The box “Complexities of Monetary Policy Rules” in the Board’s July 2018 Monetary Policy Report  contains an application of such a modified rule ; see Board of Governors (2018, pp."
" Overall, the empirical evidence suggests that these added tools helped stem the crisis and support economic recovery by strengthening the labor market and lifting inflation back toward 2 perc ent."
"  In addition to using these two additional monetary policy tools, the Federal Reserve implemented a number of other measures to stabilize the financial system, increase households and business confidence, and more generally support the economic recovery."
" These enhancements include the Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy; postmeeting press conferences; various statements about principles and strategy guiding the Committee’s normalization of monetary policy; and quarterly summaries of individual FOMC  participants ’ economic projections, assessments about the appropriate path of the federal funds rate, and judgments of the uncertainty and balance of risks  around their projections .19                                                  18 Compared with asset purchases during the financial crisis, this approach might give us gre ater rate control at medium to long maturities but carry a risk that the Federal Reserve ’s balance sheet could become unduly large."
" In September 2016, the Bank of Japan announced a target  for the yield on the Japanese 10 -year government bond and stated its commitment to expand the monetary base until inflation exceeded its 2 percent objective and stayed above that level in a stable manner."
" 19 Starting in 1979, the Federal Reserve published a summary of individual economic projections from various Board members, FOMC members, or FOMC participants in the semiannual Monetary Policy Report."
" For example , there might be ways to improve communication about the coordination of policy tools or the interplay between monetary policy and financial stability."
" The sessions will include overviews by academic experts of themes that are central to the review, including the FOMC’s monetary policy since the financial crisis,  assessments of the maximum sustainable level of employment , alternative polic y frameworks and strategies to achieve the dual mandate, policy tools , global considerations , financial stability considerations , and central bank communications."
 Other sessions will feature panels of community leaders who will share their perspectives on the labor market and the effects of interest rates on their constituencies.
" Building on the perspectives we hear and on staff analysis, the FOMC will con duct its own assessment of its monetary policy framework, beginning around the middle of the year."
