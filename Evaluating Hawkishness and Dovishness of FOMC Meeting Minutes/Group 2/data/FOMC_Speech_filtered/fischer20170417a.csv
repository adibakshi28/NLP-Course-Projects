"For release on delivery  5:00 p.m. EDT  April 17, 2017         Monetary Policy Expectations and Surprises     Remarks by   Stanley Fischer   Vice Chair man  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at the  School of International and Public Affairs  Columbia University    New York, New York         April 17, 2017   I will address the topic of central bank communications, with a particular emphasis  on those times when financial market s and the central bank have different expectations about what a central bank decision will be."
" The central bank  must provide its view s regarding the likely evolution of monetary policy, even when this view is not shared by market participants."
 A concern for surprising the market should not be a constraint on following or communicating the appropriate path of monetary policy.
" In recent de cades , it has been increasingly acknowledged that monetary policy implementation relies importantly on the management of market expectations.2  In theory, clarity about the  central bank ’s reaction function--that is , how the central bank adjusts the stance of monetary policy in response to changing economic conditions --allow s the market to alter financial conditions  smoothly ."
" The SEP in particular has been useful in providing information on policymakers’ assessment s of the potential growth rate of the economy and r*, the equilibrium real interest rate, both of which help guide the market’s expectation s of the eventual path of policy."
" To recap, over the course of May and June in 2013, the yield on 10year Treasur y securities  increased almost 1 percentage point amid increased market discussion of the eventual tapering of Fed asset purchases  and some key communications on the topic (figure 1) .4  In particular, the 10 -year yield rose about 10 basis points after then Chairman Bernanke discussed tapering in public for the first time during the questionand-answer  session of his Joint Economic Committee testimony on May 22, commenting that the  FOMC could                                                  3 Historically , there have been times when central banks have preferred to surprise markets --most notably , when changing the value of exchange rate pegs during the era of fixed exchanges."
" This survey, conducted about one week prior to each FOMC meeting, gauges primary dealers’ expectations about the economy, monetary policy, and financial market d evelopments.7   In the June 2013 primary dealer survey, the median expectation was for tapering to start in December 2013, with purchases ending in June 2014, a path not significantly different from that laid out by Chairman Bernanke in hi s postmeeting pre ss conference."
  Standard monetary policy rules suggest that the policy rate should respond to the level of economic variables such as the output gap and the inflation  rate.
" The Federal Reserve could be too predictable if this type of fundamental uncertainty about the economy does not show through to uncertainty about the monetary policy path, which could imply  that the Federal Reserve was not being sufficiently responsive to incoming data bearing  on the economic outlook."
 B ut the t ask of moving from that information to an interest rate decision is not simple and requires a great deal of analysis and back -andforth among FOMC participants at each meeting.
