"EDT  June 28, 2013          Comments on Monetary Policy     Remarks by   Jeremy C."
" To get things going, I thought I would start with some brief remarks on the current state of play in monetary policy."
" Back then, the unemployment rate was 8.1 percent and nonfarm payrolls were reported to have increased at a monthly rate of 97,000 over the prior six  months ; today, those figures are 7.6 percent and 194,000, respectively ."
" Back then, FOMC participants were forecasting unemployment rates around 73/4 percent and 7 percent for year -end 2013 and 2014, respectively , in our Summary of Economic Projections; as of the June 2013 round, these forecasts have been revised down roughly 1/2 percentage point each."
" However, this very progress has brought communications c hallenges to the fore, since the further down the road we get, the more information the market demands about the conditions that would lead us to reduce and eventually end our purchases."
" In particular, I view Chairman Bernanke’s remarks at his press conference--in which he suggested that if the economy progresses generally as we anticipate then the asset purchase program might be expected to wrap u p when unemployment falls to the 7 percent range --as an effort to put more specificity around the heretofore less well -defined notion of “substantial progress.”   It is important to stress that this added clarity is not a statement of unconditional optimism, nor does it represent a departure from the basic data -dependent philosophy of the asset purchase program."
 It would have been difficult for the Committee to put forward a 7 percent unemployment goal when the current program started and unemployment was 8.1 percent; this would have involved a lot of unc ertainty about the magnitude of asset purchases required to reach this goal.
" However, as we get closer to our goals, the balance sheet uncertainty becomes more manageable--at the same time that the market’s demand for specificity goes up."
" If the news is bad, and it is confirmed by further bad news in October and  - 5 - November, this would suggest that the 7 percent unemployment goal is likely to be further away, and the remainder of the program would be extended accordingly."
" Specifically, we  continue to have a 6.5 percent unemployment threshold for beginning to consider a first increase in the federal funds rate."
" If, for example, inflation readings continue to be on the soft side, we will have greater scope for keeping the funds rate at its effective lower bound even beyond the point when unemployment drops below 6.5 percent."
 My only point is that consumers and businesses who look to asset prices for  - 7 - clues about the future stance of monetary policy should take care not  to over -interpret these movements.
