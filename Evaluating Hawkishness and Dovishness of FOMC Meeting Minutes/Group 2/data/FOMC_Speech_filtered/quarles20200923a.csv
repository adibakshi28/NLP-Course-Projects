" From there, I will discuss my views on monetary policy, including the new longrun monetary policy strategy  recently announced by the Federal Open Market Comm ittee (FOMC)."
 The momentum is feeding into many private -sector forecasts that suggest  prospects are good for strong economic growth in the United States and other advanced economies over the rest of this year and  - 3 - next.

 The historic collapse in economic activity in March and April will take time to reverse.
"  For example, the Census Bureau reports tha t applications by people seeking to start new businesses have surged  this summer .2   The median of projections  for 2020 by FOMC participants in Sept ember  showed that both gross domestic product  (GDP)  and inflation had been revised up significantly from the median in the June projections .3  I expect that robust GDP growth over the rest  of this  year  and in 2021 will lead to strong employment gains and move inflation closer to 2 percent ."
"  Turning now to the labor market, unemployment  was still at 8.4 percent  in August  and the labor force participation rate  still down sign ificantly from February."
" But  the act’s unemployment provisions have expired, and most of the businesses that received Paycheck Protection Program ( PPP)  loans report that they have exhausted those  funds.4  In addition, one area where incr eased understanding of the disease has, in many places, not led to general changes in practice is in the widespread school closures this fall ."
"  Although still unacceptably high, an 8.4 percent unemployment rate represents a considerabl e improvement from 14.7 percent in April  and is already much lower than many thought possible  this year .5  By comparison, after the onset of the Great Recession, it took more than two  years to reduce unemployment from the peak of 10 percent t o 8.4 percent ."
" 5 Accounting for employees who still were being paid but not working during April, the Bureau of Labor Statistics believes that the peak unemployment rate may have been about 5 percentage points higher than 14.7 percent."
" However, some indicators point to slower  improvement in the job market going forward."
"  Like employment, consu mer spending has been much stronger than expected, even though spending on travel and many other categories of inperson services remains depressed ."
" Retail sales were extremely strong from May through August , driven by demand for consumer durables  such as automobiles, furniture , and home improvement."
 The strength in the  consumer and housing sectors is being supported by Fed action to lower interest rates and support  credit availab ility for creditworthy borrower s.
" In addition, the recent high rate of household savings likely  represent s a significant source of pent -up demand."
" Since then, vacancy rates have risen significantly  and rents have fallen sharply, putting at risk the  high valuations that our May Financial Stability Report  flagged as a vulnerability.10   The sharp decrease in output and employment , as well as continued slack in the economy, have put downwar d pressure on wages and the prices of  goods and services affected by the COVID event ."
" Although t he recovery since then  has helped prices retrace some of those declines, PCE inflation was still only 1 percent for the 12 months ended in July and is likely to  end 2020 well below our 2 percent longe rrun target.11   Indicators of future inflation do not  point to rapid acceleration ."

 The Committee will be closely watch ing for a further recovery of inflation and signs that inflation expectations remain well anchored  as we set monetary policy.
" Monetary Policy, Short Term and Longer Term  In the near term, with both employment and inflation significantly short of the FOMC’s  economic goals, the prescription is for a sustained aggressive use of monetary policy to support the economy."
" Taking a step back, beginning in 2019, the FOMC undertook a public review of the conceptual framework for how we approach monetary policy."
" And last month, the FOMC updated its Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, which I will call the “ consensus s tatement.”12   I want to emphasize the very public and deliberative nature of thi s policy review under the leadership of Chair Powell  and Vice Chair Richard Clarida ."
" Through a series of 15 public Fed Listens events , we received input from a broad spectrum of people :                                                   12 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2020), “Federal Open Market Committee Announces Approval of Updates to Its Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy,” press release, August 27, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20200827a.htm ."
 I believe the new consensus statement lays out a strategy that is suited  to the deman ds of setting monetary policy in our  constantly changing economy.
" First, over the past two decades, the prevailing level of interest rates in many advanced economies  has declined , leaving central bankers w ith less room to cut interest rates when the economy slows."
" In addition, experience over the past few  decades has shown us that the traditionally strong relationship between unemployment and inflation has weakened, perhaps considerably.15  We saw this weak ening relationship in the United States, as t he robust expansion before  the COVID event  led to historic and broadbased labor market gains."
" Not only did the unemployment rate drop  to longtime lows, but the wages of low - and moderate -income workers also                                                  13 Federal Reserve staff analysis on the Fed Listens initiative was pres ented and discussed at the December 2019 FOMC meeting and is part of the Fed Listens  report; see Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2020), Fed Listens:  Perspectives from the Public  (Washington:  Board of Governors, June), https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/fedlistens -report -20200612.pdf ."

"  - 11 - accelerated , and unemployment rates for historically disadvantaged groups fell to record lows."
" Yet inflation continued to run modestly below our symmetric 2 percent target , for almost the entire period , and longterm interest rates remained very low by hi storical standards.16  This  recent experience in the U nited S tates, which has also played out  elsewhere, has led to a growing consensus in the economics profession that the relationship between unemployment and inflation —commonly known as  the Phillips curve—has flattened."
"  Therefore, given the considerable benefits that we observed when unemployment fell to very low levels in recent years, the Committee determined that  a low unemployment r ate, unless accompan ied by worrisome developments in inflation or othe r risks that could impede the attainment of our goals , would not necessitate a policy response ."
 We capture this  change  in the revised consensus statement by tying future policy decisions to “shortfalls of employment from its maximum level” rather than to  “deviations” from the maximum level  as in the previous statement .
" The new framework statement also highlights that the maximum level of employment is a broadbased and inclusive goal, and it reiterates that the Committee will review a wide range of indic ators —not just the unemployment rate —in its assessments of that level."
 I believe these change s to the way the FOMC responds to labor market conditions  will result in a stronger economy  without jeopardizing our commitment  to low and stable inflation.
" In fact, I think that meeting our longer -run goal of 2 percent inflation as defined by the 12 -                                                 16 A similar experience played out in the 1990s, as the Federal Reserve under Chairman Alan Greenspan  saw unemployment decline to levels well below then -prevailing views of maximum employment, without a significant increase in inflation or unmooring of infl ation expectations."
" Even before the COVID event pushed inflation down to very low levels this year , PCE i nflation ha d been running modestly  below 2 percent  for some time , and some  measures of inflation expectations had decreased  to the low ends  of their historical ranges ."
" These developments certainly bear  watching, especially if inflation were to remain lower than it had been in previous years  or if inflation expectations were to decrease further ."
" A decrease in inflation expectations can lead to a downward spiral in actual inflation, which would further reduce already low equilibrium nominal interest rates and , among other consequences, leave the FOMC with less flexibility to address future economic  slowdowns."
"In order to better anchor long -run inflation expectations at  2 percent , the consensus s tatement makes a distinct change from the old approach."
" The Committee will seek to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time , which means that we will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time following periods when  inflation has been persistently below 2 percent."
" In the previous consensus statement , the FOMC co mmitted to a 2 percent longer -run goal for inflation that was to be “symmetric.”  T his wording already suggested some tolerance for inflation above 2 percent when it was consistent with meeting our employment mandate, and I certainly never viewed 2 percent  inflation as a ceiling."
 One reason to be comfortable with inflation at times running moderately above 2 percent is that defining and measuring inflation are very much an inexact science .
" For that reason , I  - 13 - have always considered  altern ative indicators of inflation —such as the Dallas Fed trimmed mean and, of course, core inflation—in my assessment of the likely longer -run path for  the headline PCE price index."
" As a result, as long as  inflation expectations remain well anchored close to  2 percent , modest deviations of  any particular measure of  inflation around 2 percent  are not a first -order concern in my decision framework."
" In fact, I likely will be even more patient in reacting to small upward deviations, given the Committee’s move  to focus on shortfall s of employment from maximum employment  rather than deviations ."
" By providing additional monetary policy accommoda tion through stronger, outcomes -based forward guidance, the Committee hopes  to quicken the pace of the recovery."
"   Conclusion In conclusion, t he COVID event was an  enormous economic shock in the first half of 2020 , but a recovery is underway, and the world seems to be adjusting in ways that allow us to address public concerns about the virus without sudden stops in economic activity."
