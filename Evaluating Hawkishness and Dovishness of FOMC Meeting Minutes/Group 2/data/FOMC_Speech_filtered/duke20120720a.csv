" In the case of the Federal Reserve, monetary policy is conducte d to achieve our statutory objectives of maximum employment and price stability."
 I will start with the monetary policy responses  of the Federal Reserve and other central banks during the financial crisis.
"   From the outset, the Federal Reserve vigor ously used its traditional toolkit for managing shortterm interest rates."
" These sw ap arrangements pose esse ntially no risk to the Federal Reserve:  They are unwound (with a fe e paid by the central bank drawing on the swap arrangement to the Federal Reserve) at th e exact same exchange rate that applied to the original transaction, they are conducted w ith major central banks with track records of                                                  2 The 14 central banks were those in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, the euro area, South Korea, Japan, New Zealand, Mexico, Norway, Singapore, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom."
" With substantial economic slack remaining, these central banks faced the challenge of finding ways to further ease monetary policy."
 The idea was to put downward pressure on longerterm yields to spur demand and also to encourage some portfolio rebalancing toward  riskier assets and loans to the private sector.
" In August 2011, the Committee statement included forward guidance that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the fe deral funds rate at least through mid2013--a date that was later extended to late 2 014--which put further downward pressure on longerterm interest rates."
" Accordingly, as was also the case in emerging Asia, the monetary policy stance of several central banks in Latin America, such as Brazil a nd Chile, diverged from those of advanced economies."
" The resulting rise in interest rate differentia ls, on top of the generally stronger growth in Latin America, helped to fuel capital inflows, which, at times, have proved challenging for the policymakers of thes e economies to manage."
" Of course, more recently, with intensification of the crisis in Europe, some Latin American countries, most notably Brazil, have again lowered thei r policy rates in respons e to concerns about slowing growth."
" Accordingly, it is imperative for each central bank to have monetary policy tools to appropriately address domestic objectives independent of the actions  of other central banks."
