"                                                   - 2 - Against that background,  I am concerned about several  troubling proposals that would subject monetary policy to undue political pressure and place new limits on the Fed’s ability to respond to future crises."
" The first goes by the somewhat misleading name of “ Audit the Fed ,” and would subject the Federal Reserve’s conduct of monetary policy to unlimited c ongressional policy audits (not  to be confused with financial  audits, which are already conducted regularly .)2  The second is a proposal to require the Fed to adopt and follow a specific equation in setting monetary policy and to face immediate congressional hearing s and investigation by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) whenever it deviates from the policy dictated by that equation.3  And , third, there are discussions about imposing new limitations on the Fed’s long -held powers to provide liquidity during a financial crisis ."
"                                                   - 3 - Third, and most importantly, I believe these proposals fail to anticipate the significant costs and risks of subjecting monetary policy to political pressure  and constraining the Fed ’s ability to carry out its traditional role of providing liquidity  in a crisis."
" At the same time, the Federal Reserve used monetary policy to help stabilize the economy."
" After cutting our target for the overnight interest rate on loans between banks --our usual monetary policy tool --as low as it could go, the Fed took further action using unconventional policy tools ."
" These po licies involved communication, providing “forward guidance” that the Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) expected to keep rates low for longer than had been expected, and also purchasing large amounts of longer -term Treasury debt and other securities to p ut downward pressure on long -term interest rates."
"As the Congress consi ders proposals  that will affect the conduct of monetary policy and the Fed’s  ability to respond in a crisis, I believe it is also important to recognize how effective the Fed’s  response has been."
"  With respect to monetary policy, the unconventional policies were designed to stimulate the economy in the same way as traditional monetary policy, by lowering interest rates."
" Without these steps, the slump in the labor market and the broader economy surely would have been even deeper and more prolonged, and the low wage and price inflation we are still experiencing  might have turned into outrig ht deflation."
"Critics warned that these policies  would unleash uncontrollable inflation, fail to stimulate demand , and court other known and unknown risks ."
 Inflation has continued to run well below the Committee’s 2 percent objective.
" Indeed,  some argue today that low inflation should cause the Committee to hold off from raising interest rates."
" As I noted at the outset, due in part to the Fed ’s effective response to the crisis, the recovery in the United States ha s been stronger  than that of other advanced economies, with more rapid job creation, lower unemployment , and faster growth."
" On the contrary, the Fed ’s lending was targeted t o 6 On the effectiveness of the Fed’s unconventional monetary policy, see  Eric M."

" Loans were extended based on the same terms that the Fed eral Reserve has always applied —the borrowers  must be solvent, the loans must be sec ured, and an appropriate interest rate must be charged."
" First, the Fed does not set its own goals for monetary policy."
" Congress assigned us the goals of price stability and maximum employment-- that is, the highest level of employment achievable without threatening price stability."
"                                                   - 7 - every year to report on monetary policy, and, in practice, to respond to questions about anything and everything related to the Fed’s activities."
"  More generally, the Fed  is open and transparent in its operations, including those related to monetary policy, accounting for itself in timely postmeeting FOMC statements, minutes, broadcast  press conferences, a nd speeches.8  Details about the Fed ’s balance sheet are on the public record; in fact, every security owned by the Fed  is identified individually on the website of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York .9  The FOMC’s plans to normalize the balance sheet hav e been the subject of exhaustive discussion--in FOMC meetings, in speeches by policymakers, and among the many journalists and academics who analyze and discuss Fed policies."
" As always, monetary policy decisions were debated and voted on by the FOMC and announced immediately , with detailed explanations provide d in the minutes of th ese deliberations ."
" The Fed created a website and issued a monthly report to the Congress disclosing details on all  loans, such as the quantity and quality of collateral posted by borrowers.13 The Significant Costs of Restrictions on the Fed ’s Independence  As I said at the outset, I believe these proposals under consideration by the Congress fail to anticipate the significant costs and risks of subjecting the Fed’s conduct of monetary policy to political pressure  and of limiting  the ability of the Fed  to execute its traditional role of keeping credit flowing to American households and businesses in a financial crisis."
" Let me first address “ Audit the Fed ,” which would repeal a narrow but critical exemption, adopted by the Congress in 1978, to limit GAO policy reviews of the Fed’s conduct of monetary policy."
" The Congress granted this exemption because the costs of involving the GAO in monetary policy , including the substantial risk of political interference, far outweigh the potential benefits."
 This could put the GAO in the position of reviewing the FOMC’s pol icy decisions and recommending its own course for monetary policy.
"                                                   - 10 - the subject of GAO policy audits, such as procurement decisions that may be brought to light only by the GAO’s attention, monetary policy decisions occur with all of the world watching."
" With all of this transparency and analysis, very little would be revealed by GAO policy audits that would help evaluate the effectiveness of monetary policy."
 The benefits of frequent GAO policy audits would also be low because the effects of monetary policy are felt with a considerable time lag and are often only clear years later.
" Audit the Fed  also risks inserting the Congress directly into monetary policy decisionmaking , reversing decades of deliberate effort by the Congress to insulate  the Fed from political pressure in  carrying out its day -today duties."
" Long experi ence, in the United States and in other advanced economies, has demonstrated that monetary policy is most successful when decisions are rendered independent of influence by elected officials."
" As recent U.S. history has shown, elected officials have often pushed  for easier policies that serve short -term political interests, at the expense of higher inflation and damage to the long -term health and stability of the economy.14   14 The seminal research establishing a link between central bank independence and macroeconomic performance is Alberto Alesina and Lawrence H."
"                                                  - 11 - After World War II and as recently as the early 1970s, political pressures likely influenced Federal Reserve decision making  in a way which helped cause excessive inflation and related bouts of economic weakness."
" In 1977, as what came to be called the Great Inflation neared its peak, the Congress passed legisl ation that spelled out the goals for monetary policy --maximum employment and stable prices --but left it to the Fed  to precisely define those goals and the means by which they would be achieved.15  To preserve the Fed ’s independence in implementing policy to  reach these goals, the Congress exempted monetary policy from the GAO investigations it was then authorizing for other  Fed operations ."
" Over the 20 years or so prior to the crisis, the Federal Reserve was able to maintain low and stable inflation , and recessions were brief and mild.16  That is not to say that the Fed  got everything just right during this period."
" But it seems to me that any  precrisis shortcomings were in regulation and supervision by the Fed and other agencies , rather than  in monetary policy."
  And there are other costs from subjecting monetary policy to GAO investigations.

"                                                  - 12 - To those who may doubt tha t GAO investigations  would be used by the Congress to try to influence monetary policy, let me briefly describe another proposal which envisions exactly that."
 This bill would require the FOMC to carry out monetary policy according to a simple equation and  require immediate congressional hearings and a GAO audit whenever monetary policy deviates from this equation.17  Simple policy rules of this nature are used by the FOMC and by central banks around the world as a guide to policy.
" 18 As part of its ongoing Initiative on Global Markets (IGM) poll, the University of Chicago, Booth School of Business, asked 44 prominent economists to respond to the following statement:   “Legislation introduced in Congress would require the Fed eral Reserve to “submit to the appropriate congressional committees…a Directive Policy Rule,” which shall describe “the strategy or rule of the Federal Open Market Committee for the systematic quantitative adjustment of the Policy Instrument Target to resp ond to a change in the Intermediate Policy Inputs.” Should the Fed deviate from the rule, the Fed Chair would have to “testify before the appropriate congressional committees as to why the [rule]…is not in compliance.”  Enacting this provision would improv e monetary policy outcomes in the U.S. ”  None of the participants agreed with the statement, and almost all disagreed or strongly disagreed."
 The Congress has wisely given the Fed  the tools it needs to implement monetary policy and respond to future crises  as well as  crucial independence to do its work free from short -term political influence.
" Congressional oversight of the Federal Reserve, including its conduct of monetary policy , is extensive , but no doubt could be improved in ways that do not threaten the Fed’s effectiveness."
 I would welcome discussions with the Congress about ways to aid its important oversight of monetary policy.
