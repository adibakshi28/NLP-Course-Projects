"Bowman   Member    Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at the  New Jersey  Bankers Association Annual Economic Leadership Forum   Somerset , New Jersey         March 7 , 2024 I would like to thank the New Jersey Bankers Association for the invitation to share my thoughts with you today.1  While I welcome the opportunity to share my thoughts about monetary policy, the economy, and the path of regulatory reform, I find it even more valuable to hear your views on local banking and economic conditions in the communities you serve , and your perspectives on trends in bank regulation and supervision."
"Before discussing  bank regulation, I would like to briefly touch on the economy and monetary policy."
" Monetary Policy  Over the past two years, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has significantly tightened the stance of monetary policy to address high inflation."
"  We have seen continued progress on inflation over the past year , with the 12month readings through January of total and core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation moving down to  2.4 percent and 2.8 percent , respectively, both at the lowest rates we have seen  since early  2021."
" Although inflation declined  over the second half of 2023 , the January inflation data suggest that progress in bringing  inflation down further may be slower going forward."
" Throughout  this time , economic activity has remained strong with ongoing strength in consumer spending."
 - 2 -  strong jobs reports —including upward revisions to employment growth— show a continued tight labor market .
" Last year, t he average pace of job gains slowed and the labor force participation rate rose through November, with the unemployment rate edging up to  3.7 percent."
" In recent  months , however, job growth has rebounded, and the  labor force participation rate declined, retracing some of its earlier gains."
"  At its current setting , our monetary policy stance is restrictive and appears to be  appropriately calibrated to reduce inflationary pressures."
" As I’ve noted recently, m y baseline outlook continues to be that inflation will decline further with the policy rate held steady , but I still see a  number of  upside inflation risks that affect my outlook."
" There is also the risk that  a loosening in financial conditions and additional fiscal stimulus  could add momentum to demand, stalling any further progress or even causing inflation to reaccelerate."
" Finally, there is a risk that continued labor market tightness could lead to persistently high core services inflation."
 R ecent labor market data suggest ongoing e levated wage growth as some businesses continue to report above -average wage increases to compensate for  elevated prices and high inflation.
"  Given these risks, and the general uncertainty regarding the economic outlook, I will continue to watch the data closely as I assess the appropriate path of monetary policy."
" The frequency and extent of data revisions over the past few years, as seen in the most recent employment report, make the task of  assessing the current state of the economy as well as predicting how the economy will evolve even more challenging, and I will remain cautious in my approach to considering future changes in the stance of policy."
" Should the incoming data - 3 -  continue to indicate that inflation is moving sustainably toward our 2 percent goal, it will eventually become appropriate to gradually lower our policy rate to prevent monetary policy from becoming overly restrictive."
 Reducing our policy rate too soon could result in requiring further future pol icy rate increases to return inflation to 2 percent over the longer run.
   It is important to note that monetary policy is not on a preset course.
" While the current stance of monetary policy appears to be at a restrictive level that will bring inflation down to 2 percent over time, I remain willing to raise the federal funds rate at a future meeting should the incoming data indicate that progress on inflation has stalled or reversed."
 Restoring price stability is essential for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run.

" Liquidity requirements, if not appropriately designed and calibrated, could trap resources that would otherwise be put to better  4  One avenue by which interested parties can provide feedback is through the recently launched mandatory review of regulatory burdens under the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act of 1996."
