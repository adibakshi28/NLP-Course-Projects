"For release on delivery  11:15 a.m. EST (10:15 a.m. C ST) January 7, 2017         Low Interest Rates and the Financial System     Remarks by  Jerome H."
"Powell   Member   Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at the  77th Annual Meeting of the American Finance  Association   Chicago, Illinois         January 7, 20 17   Thank you for this invitation  to discuss low interest rates and the financial system ."
 The framing of this topic raises the question of whether low interest rates have somehow undermined the stability and functioning of the financial system.
" I will argue that “low  for long” interest rates have supported slow but steady progress to full employment and stable prices , which has in turn suppo rted financial stability."
 I will begin by focusing briefly on the macroeconomic effects of low interest rates .
" Highly Accommodative Monetary Policy  The financial crisis and the G reat R ecession posed the most signi ficant macroeconomic challenges for the United States  in a half -century, leaving behind high unemployment and below -target inflation  and calling for  highly accommodative  monetary polic ies."
" Isolat ing the effects of these policies is challenging , but s tudies generally show that  they  lowered rates across the curve and moved other asset prices as well.1  It is  even  more challenging to evaluate their  effects on aggregate demand."
" And low rates have clearly not produced a boom in corporate investment, although standard ac celerator models suggest that investment has largely been consistent with the weak pace of economic growth."
" Nonetheless, there is good reason to think that low rates have provided significant support for demand, and my view is that they have done so.2  As you can see in slide 1, we are now close to meeting our dual mandate --a reasonable summary statistic for the effects of policy ."
" While growth  has been frustratingly slow , employment gains have been solid."
   Other Factors Are Holding Down Rates There are also many f actors other than monetary policy that are holding down longterm interest rates.
" T he next slide decomposes longterm nominal yields into expected future short -term real rates, expected future inflation, and a term premium."
"  The downward trend in nominal term premiums likely reflects both lower inflation risk and the fact that, with inflation expectations anchore d, nominal bonds have become an increasingly good hedge against market risk."
" The most interest rate sensitive sectors of the economy, such as consumer durables and residential investment, have exhibited higher growth than other sectors since the second round of quantitative easing by the Federal Reserve ."
" G lobal factors may have put downward pressure on term premium s because of  anxiety about the foreign outlook, which may have increased demand for U.S. assets, or because low rates abroad ha ve depressed U.S. term premiums  through a global portfolio balance channel .5  And real rates are quite low globally, reflecting the step -down of  productivity growth over the past 10 years as well as shi fts in savings and investment demand due to demographic change.6 The Core of the Financial System Is Much Stronger  Before turning to the interplay between low rates and the financial system, I will simply  point out that both improved risk management at the  largest, most systemically important  financial institutions  (SIFIs) and stronger regulation have made the core of the system much stronger and more resilient than before the crisis.7  The SIFIs  have more                                                  4 The changing risk profile of nominal Treasury bonds can be seen from its capital asset pricing model (or CAPM) beta, a measure of t he co -movement between returns on longer -term Treasury securities and the  equity market."
  5 Figure A.2  shows the response in daily changes in 10year U.S. Treasury yields to changes in 10 -year German bund yields around European Central Bank (ECB) monetary policy decisions since 2010.
 The significantly positive regression coefficient is evidence of substant ial spillovers from ECB monetary policy to U.S. long -term yields.
"   Low Rates Can Mean Tradeoffs  So far, I have argued that low rates have supported aggregate demand and brought us very close to full employment and 2 percent  inflation ; that forces other than monetary policy have been pushing rat es lower for more than 30 years ; and that the core of the financial system is now much stronger and more resilient than before the crisis."
" All of that said, I would also agree that monetary policy may sometimes face tradeoff s between macroeconomic objecti ves and financial stability."
" F or example, the Fed’s initial unconventional policies suppor ted both market functioning and aggregate demand."
" More broadly, post -crisis monetary policy support ed asset values, reduced interest payments, and increased both employment and income ."
" Low -forlong interest rates can have adverse effects on financial institutions and markets through a number of plausible channels , as listed on t he next slide .8  After all, low interest rates are intended  to encourage some risk -                                                 8 See Adrian and Liang (2014)."
" Historically , recessions often occurred when the Fed tightened to control inflation."
" More recently, with inflation  under control, overheating has shown up in the form of  financial excess."
  Core PCE inflation remained close to or below 2  percent  during both the late1990s stock  market bubble  and the  mid2000s housing bubble  that led to the financial crisis .
"  Low longterm interest rates have weighed on profitability in the financial sector, although firms have so far  cope d with those pressures."
" Even so, data on asset                                                  9 See Dell’Ariccia, Laeven, and Suarez (forthcoming), w hich finds evidence for a risktaking channel of monetary policy based on supervisory ratings of U .S."
" Beka ert, Hoerova, and Lo Duca (2013) find that accommodative monetary policy shocks lead to a decline in the VIX , a measure of implied volatility,  by lowering both expected volatility and the risk premium ."
" Highrisk corporate debt (the sum of highyield bonds and leveraged loans) grew rapidly in 2013 and 2014 (slide), although growth  has declined sharply since then .11  However ,                                                  10 The Federal Reserve, along with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, issued guidance regarding prudent management of risks from  loans secured by commercial real estate (CRE) in late 2015."
" Low interest rates have encouraged risk -taking and higher leverage in some sectors and have weighed on profitability i n others, but the areas where there are  sign s of excess are isolated ."
"Conclusion To sum up, low interest rates have supported economic activity and gradually brought us back to full employment and 2 percent  inflation."
" Still, a period of low rates for a long time could present significant challenges for monetary policy."
" Ultimately, the only way to get sustainably higher interest rates is to improve the broader environment for growth, by adopt ing policies designed to increase productivity and potential output  over the long term--policies that are mainly outside the scope of our work at the Federal Reserve.13                                                      12 See Greenwood and Hanson (2013)."
