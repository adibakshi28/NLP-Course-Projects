" I will begin by  reviewing the outlook, then provide  a brief recap  of how financial market  liquidity  has fared, and finish  by comment ing on the resilience and resolvability  of the large interconnected  banks .1 Outlook  for the United States  I am heartened by the continued strong progress on employment and  the resilience of American consumers , which stand out  against a considerably more challenging  global backdrop."
" In Febru ary, the unemployment rate was 4.9 percent --a level that is one -half its peak  during  the depths of the recess ion in  2009."
" Last Friday , we learned that employment growth has averaged 223,000 per month over the past 12 months."
" And  there likely is  some room to go:  T he prime -age employment -topopulation ratio remains 13/4 percentage points  below levels prevailing prior to the financial crisis, while a relatively large share of employees  who are working  part time would prefer to work full time."
" In addition, wage growth remai ns relatively slow ."
" Over the past two years, consumption has increased at about a 3 percent pace, on average, and I expect to see growth to continue at close to this pace based on s olid job and income  growth --together with  elevated readings                                                  I am grateful to Andrew Figura for his assistance in preparing this text."
The housing sector has also contributed steadily to growth over the past year.
" With housing activity well below pre -recession norms, i t appears there is  still scope  for continued growth in construction activity."
"  In contrast, sectors of the economy that are sensitive to energy prices or international demand have been a drag ."
"  Although the e uro a rea and Japan are recovering, their demand growth remains very low, despite extraordinary monetary accommodation."
 In emerging market economies  growth last yea r came in at only one -half the  average rate from 2009 to 2013.
" Because China has accounted for one -third of the growth in world Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) and trade, the recent  slippage  in Chinese economic growth is  having an important effect globally ."
" Even if Chinese growth does not slide further, the changing composition of its growth toward consumption and services and away from  resource -intensive  manufacturing  and investment  will pose important challenges to commodity exporters and other  emerging economies , especially since China had previously accounted for upwards of one -half of global imports of many base metals ."
"                                                 2 Despite the drop -off in drilling investment, oil production has been surprisingly resilient, as producers have increased the productivity of established wells."
  - 3 - Weak foreign demand relative to the United States has pushed down net exports  and contributed to a nearly 20 percent strengt hening of the real trade -weighted dollar since mid -2014.
" As a result, net exports subtracted a little more than 1/2 percentage point from  GDP growth in 2014 and 2015, and econometric models suggest that past appreciation will lead to close to another  1 pe rcentage point subtraction this year.3 These effects are especially prominent in the U.S. m anufacturing sector, where output is sluggish, and t he agricultural sector has also been hit hard by the rise in the value of the dollar."
" In addition, with profits at many firms adversely affected by the rise in the dollar and weak demand abroad, business fixe d investment increased  only 11/2 percent last year after contributing significantly to growth earlier in the recovery."
" In addition, progress  on inflation has been slow."
" Reductions in energy prices are, in part, responsible for this low rate, and if energy prices stabilize, top -line inflation should move higher."
"  - 4 - But even after discounting  the influence of energy prices, core PCE  inflation has been stubbornly stuck in the vicinity of 11/4 to 11/2 percent  since 2012."
"4  Most recently, the dollar has played an important role in holding down nonoil import prices, which fell 3 -1/2 percent last year and subtracted an estimated 1/2 percentage point from core inflation.5  Should the dollar stabilize, the downward influence on inflation should dissipate."
"If the labor market continues to improve, higher resource utilization should also put some  upward pressure on inflation going forward."
" However, the effect of resource utilization on inflation is estimated to be much lower today than in past decades.6   An important concern about persistently low inflation is that it can lead to a fall in longe rterm inflation expectations, making it much more difficult to achieve our inflation target."
" For the most part,  long erterm inflation expectations appear to have remained reasonably stable, though there are some concerning signs."
 Longer -term inflation expectations of professional forecasters and primary dealers have held quite steady in recent years at levels consistent with the FOMC’s target .
" However, households’ inflation expectations appear to have moved down somewhat r ecently."
 Fiveto-10year inflation                                                  4 Core consumer price index ( CPI) inflation has b een 1/2 percentage point higher than core PCE inflation over the 12 months through January.
" Over the past 15 years , core CPI inflation has averaged about 1/4 percentage point more than core PCE inflation."
"8 -9 of the February 2016 Monetary Policy Report  (Board of Governors, 2016) ."
" Threeyear inflation expectations in the New York Federal Reserve ’s Survey of Consumer Expectations  have also moved steadily lower over the past two  years, though the recent decline in energy prices may explain much of this drift."
"Notably , market -based measures of inflation compensatio n based on Treasury Inflation -Protected Securities  (TIPS ) and nominal Treasury  yields are at historically low levels."
" At the five -year, fiveyear-ahead horizon, inflation compensation is 1 percentage point lower than mid -2014 levels ."
 Declines in swap -based measures of inflation compensation have been similar.
" However, these declines appear correlated with oil prices, and it is not clear  to what extent  these declines reflect  a change in inflation expectations, c hanges in investor demand for TIPS versus nominal Treasury securities,  or an improvement in the risk charact eristics of nominal Treasur y securit ies versus other assets."
" Over the next couple of  years, there are reasons to expect energy prices and the dollar to  eventually stabilize, output to increase at  around the moderate pace it has averaged over the recovery thus far, foreign growth to recover somewhat, the U.S. labor market to improve further, and inflation to move toward our 2 percent target."
" For example, China faces  risks  as it navigates a  sharp slowing in its goods sector, a large buildup in corporate debt , and an apparent surge in demand for foreign assets, although China possesses resources  to deal with these challenges ."
" More broadly, sources of robust demand around the globe are few, and sources of weakness relatively  - 6 - greater , as evidenced by persistently below target i nflation in all of the major  advanced economies."
"  Monetary Policy  In today’s circumstances,  policy could usefully follow  two simple guidelines."
" Given weak and decelerating foreign  demand , it is critical to carefully protect and preserve the progress we have made here at home through prudent adjustments to the policy path."
 T ighte r financial conditions and softe r inflation expectations  may  pose  risks to the downside for  inflation and domestic activity .
" From a risk -management perspective, th is argu es for patience as the outlook become s clearer .7 Second, we should put a high premium on clear evidence that inflation is moving toward our 2 percent target."
 Inflation has persistently under performed relative to our target.
" Moreover, measures of inflation compensation and some survey -based measures of inflation expectations suggest that inflation expectations may have edged lower."
" Given the  currently  weak relationship between economic slack  and inflation and the persistent , depressing effects of energy price declines and exchange rate increases, we should be cautious in assessing  that a tightening labor market will soon move inflation back to 2 percent."
"  In this regard, core PCE inflation increased 1.7 percent over the 12 months ending in January, a noticeable stepup from an increase of 1.3 percent over the preceding 12 months.8                                                  7 To the extent that the neutral rate of interest --the rate that keeps output at its potential level and inflation at its target --has fallen in the U nited States and is low around the world, this may weigh on the policy path."
"   8 Because the most recent 12 -month change in core PCE prices includes several relatively large monthly increases in core PCE prices in the first part of 2015, it is possible that 12 -month core PCE inflation will  - 7 - Liquidity   In addition to raising uncertainty around t he outlook, the  recent financial market volatility has underscored the importance of ongoing attention to  the resilience of market liquidity."
" Although it is fair to say that the recent uptick in volatility ha s in part re duced earlier concerns about  prolonged low volatility and associated  reach -foryield behavior , it has placed added focus  on the resilience of liquidity , particularly in markets, such as the market for corporate bonds, that may be prone to gapping  between liquidity demand and supply in stressed conditions."
