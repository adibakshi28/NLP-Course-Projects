"Quarles   Vice Chair man for Supervision   Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at   “Currencies, Capital, and Central Bank Balances: A Policy Conference”  a Hoover Institution  Monetary Policy Conference  Stanford University   Stanford, California         May 4 , 2018   Thank you very much to the Hoover Institution for hosting this  important conference and to John Taylor for inviting me to participate.1  In my capacity a s both the Vice Chairman for Supervision  at the Board of Governors and a member of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), part of my job is to consider the intersection of regulatory and monetary policy issues, the subject of my discussion today."
" This  topic  is a very complex and dynamic nexu s, especially  as regulation and the implementation of monetary policy continue to evolve."
" Such a topic is admittedly difficult to address in the time we have today, so I  will focus on a particular component of the regulation --the Liquidity Coverage  Ratio (LCR) --and its link to banks’ demand for U.S. central bank reserve balances."
"  - 2 - Monetary Policy and the Efficiency of the Financial System  Before I delve into the more complicated subject of how one type of bank regulation affects the Fed’s balance sheet, let me say a few words about financial regulation and how it relates to monetary policy more generally."
 So how is efficiency of the financial syste m connected to monetary policy?
" To put it in the  simplest fashion , to the extent that the efficiency of t he financial system is improved, it will improve the transmission of monetary policy to the real economy."
"With this backdrop, a relevant question for monetary policymakers is, what quantity of central bank reserve balances will banks likely want to hold, and , hence, how might the LCR affect banks’ reserve demand and thereby the longer -run size of the Fed’s balance sheet?"
 Let me emphasize that policymakers have  long been aware of the potential influence that reg ulation s may have on reserve demand  and thus the longer -run size of the Fed’s balance sheet .
" And, of course, regulatory influences on banks’ behavior, my focus today, is just one of many factors that could affect policymakers’ decisions regarding the appropriate long -run size of the Fed’s bala nce sheet.7  In particular, in augmenting its Policy Normalization Principles  and Plans, the FOMC stated in June 2017 that it “c urrently anticipates reducing the quantity of reserve balances, over time, to a level appreciably below that seen in recent year s but larger than before the financial crisis ” and went on to note that “ the level will reflect the banking system ’s demand for reserve balances  and the Committee’s decisions about how to implement monetary  policy most efficiently and effectively in the fu ture.”8                                                      7 For example, a separate factor  that is relevant for policymakers in this regard is the FOMC’s choice of longrun framework for monetary policy implementation."
" As you can see, the current l evel of reserves --at around $2 trillion --is many orders of magnitude higher than the level that prevailed before  the financial crisis, a result of the Fed’s large -scale asset purchase programs that aimed to mitigate the sever e economic downturn and stem  disinflationary pressures in the wake of the crisis."
" In addition, because these changes happened together, it is reasonable to conclude that the current environment is likely not ver y informative about banks’ underlying  demand for reserve balances."
" Let me emphasize that this question is highly speculative --policymakers have not decided the desired long -run size of the Fed’s balance sheet , nor, as I noted earlier, do we have a definitive handle on banks’ longrun demand for  reserve balances ."
" Indeed, the FOMC has said that it “ expects to learn more about the underlying demand for reserves  during the process of balance sheet normalization .”10  Nonetheless, let me  spend a little time reflecting on this challenging  question."
" If relative asset returns are a key driver of reserve demand, then interest rates across various types of HQLA will adjust on an ongoing basis  until banks are satisfied  holding the aggregate quantity of reserves that is available ."
 This finding suggests that there  likely  is no single “representative bank” behavioral model that can capture all we might want to know about banks’ demand for central bank reserve balances .
" In any case, this picture illustrates the complexities that are inherent in understanding banks’ underlying demand for reserve balances, a topic for whic h more research would be quite valuable to policymakers."
"    So, what does this finding say about the longer -run level of reserve balances demanded by banks?"
        It is important to poin t out that the Fed’s balance sheet will remain larger than  it was before the crisis even after abstracting from the issue of banks’ longer -run demand for reserve balances.
 - 11 - that generally reflects the pace of expansion of economic activity in nominal terms.
 Recent growth in such items means that the longer -run size of the Fed’s balance sheet will be noticeably larger than before the crisis  regardless of the volume of reserve balances that might ultimately prevail.
" The kink in each curve captures what the FOMC has referred to as the point of “nor malization” of the size of the Fed’s balance sheet --that is, the point at which the balance sheet will begin to expand again to support the underlying growth in liabilities items such as Federal Reserve notes in circulation."
" All else being equal, greater longer -run demand for currency,  reserve balances, or other liabilities implies an earlier timing of balance sheet normalization and a higher longer -run size of the balance sheet, as illustrated by the top line."
" And the converse --smaller demand for these l iabilities and a later timing of normalization , illustrated by the bottom line --is also possible."
" That  is quite a range of time, so a s the balance sheet normalization program continues, the Fed will be closely monitoring developments for clues about banks’ underlying demand for reserves."
"  Retail deposits  have grown quite a bit since the crisis, especially in light of the prolonged period of broad -based low interest rates and accommodative monetary policy, limiting the need for bank s to compet e for this  most stable form of deposits."
" However, the combination of rising interest rates  and the Fed’s shrinking balance sheet, together with banks’ ongoing need to meet the LCR,  may alter these competitive dynamics."
 The overall effects of the decline in the Fed’s balance sheet will depend both on who ultimately ends up holding the securities in place of the Fe d and on the full range of portfolio adjustments that other economic agents ultimately make as a result.14   We will also be monitoring movements in interest rates.
"  This situation could occur if some banks eventually find that they are holding fewer reserves than desired at a given constellat ion of interest rates  and, in response, begin to bid for more federal funds while selling Treasury securities  or other assets."
  Interest rates will adjust up until banks are indifferent with regard to holding the relatively smaller volume  of reserves available in the banking system .
"Overall, policymakers will be monitoring to make sure that the level of reserves the Fed supplies to the banking sector, which influences the composition of assets and liabilities on banks’ balance sheets as we ll as market interest rates, provides the desired stance of monetary policy to achieve the FOMC’s dual mandate of maximum employment and stable prices."
" That is, broadly speaking, should the Fed continue to use an operational framework that is characterized by having relatively abundant reserves  and operate in what is termed a “floor regime ,” or should it use one in which the supply of reserves is  managed so that it is much closer to banks’ underlying demand for reserves as in a “corridor regime ”?"
" Second, while U.S. liquidity regulations likely influence banks’ demand for reserves, the Fed is not constrained by such regulations i n deciding its operational framework , because U.S. banks will be readily able to meet their regulatory liquidity requirements using the range of available high -quality liquid assets, of which reserve balances is one type."
" The final and most general point is simply to underscore the premise with which I began these remarks:  Financial regulation and monetary policy are , in important respects , connected."
