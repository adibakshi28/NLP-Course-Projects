 I will conclude with a discussion of monetary policy.
" The Current State of the Economy  As you know, the Congress has tasked the Federal Reserve with achieving  stable prices and maximum employment--the dual mandate."
"  The Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) has a n objective  of 2 percent  for inflation , as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures."
" The Committee sees th is objective as symmetrical, so that minor deviations above or below 2 percent are treated alike.1  Inflation has consistently run below 2 percent since 2011, and  is now at 1.2 percent  over the p ast 12 months  (figure 1)."
 This headline measure of inflation has recently been held down by falling energy and food prices.
" W e also monitor c ore inflation, which excludes the volatile energy and food components because they often send a misleading signal about underlying inflation pressures ."
 Core inflation is running at 1.7 percent  over the past 12 months .
U.S. i nflation trended steadily lower after the Volcker disinflation of 1981 to 1982 and has been low and reasonab ly stable  for many years.
" In fact, for the past several years inflation has  run below policy targets in many parts of the world, including here in the                                                  1 See the FOMC’s  “Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy,” FOMC, January 26, 2016, www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_LongerRunGoals_20160126.pdf ."
  Many of us  are old enough to remember  when the only challenge was to keep inflation low.
 But toolow inflation can also be a serious problem.
 Below -target inflation increases the real value of debts ow ed by households and businesses  and reduces the ability of central banks to respond to downturns.
    The public’s e xpectations about inflation are thought to be an  important driver of actual inflation.
" Many measures of U.S. inflation expectations --both from surveys and from market -based  readings --are still well below their pre -crisis levels , although some have moved up as of late ."
 The  only way to en sure that inflation  expectations remain safely anchored near  the FOMC’s target is to keep inflation close to th at target  on a consistent bas is.
" So, while the current shortfall may seem small, it is important that inflation continue to move up to 2 percent , as I expect it will."
"The FOMC does  not have a numeri cal goal for maximum employment because the long -run sustainable level of employment c hanges over time and is determined mainly by nonmonetary factors that are outside the Fed’s control, such as evolving labor market practices, demographics, social change, and fiscal and regulatory policies."
" Nonetheless, four times each year FOMC participants write down their estimates of the longer -run normal level of the unemployment rate (the natural rate) ; at the September FOMC meeting the median estimate was 4.8 percent , very close to the current unemployment rate of 4.9 percent."
" E mployers have been adding roughly 180,000 jobs per month so far this year--a pace a little below  that of the past several years  but significantly h igher than underlying growth in the labor force  (figure 2) ."
" Despite the se strong job gains, the  - 3 - unemployment rate has flattened  out this year after several years of sharp declines , thanks to welcome developments in  labor force participation (figure 3)."
" When people enter or re enter the labor force and begi n to search for a job, that is generally a good thing even though at the margin their entry tends to increase the unemployment rate (or prevent it from declining) ."
"                                                   2 The current participation rate is within the range of estimates cited in  Stephanie Aaronson, Tomaz Cajner, Bruce Fallick, Felix Galbis -Reig, Christ opher Smith, and William Wascher (2014), “Labor Force Participation:  Recent Developments and Future Prospects,” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity , Fall ,  pp."
 - 4 - Surveys of households and firms also suggest that we are near full employment (figure 5 ).
" For example, respondents  are now more likely to say that jobs are plentiful than that they are hard to get --a response that has generally been seen  when the economy is near full employment."
" Moreover, wages are now rising faster than inflation , and faster than  output per hour ."
" Taken together , labor market indicators show an economy that is on solid footing  and close to our mandate of maximum employment."
 Employment is now 6.5 million higher than its pre -crisis  peak.
    But this expansion has also had the slowest pace of GDP growth of  any post war recover y (figure 6).
" Given steady but modest growth , we have seen  surprisingly large  gains in employment and, until this year , a rapid  reduction in the unemployment  rate."
" Even though GDP growth has been slow, job gains during this recovery have been strong er than those during  the previous expansion--the so -called jobless recovery of the early 2000s."
" The combination of weak growth and strong hiring in this expansion implies small increases i n output per hour, or productivity."
" In fact, productivity  has been increas ing at a dismal pace, compared with  virtually any period in the post war era ."
 I will return to productivity and growth in a moment .
" Output has increased faster , and unemployment has declined faster,  in the United States than in other major advanced economies ."
" And  the Fed’s challenges in getting inflation back up to 2 percent  are similar to, but not as severe as, those faced by some other major monetary authorities ."
" Turning to the near -term outlook, a fter a slow patch in  the first half of this year, growth has clearly streng thened."
" I expect that the economy will continue on its path of the last few years , with  real GDP growth of about 2 percent, strong job gains, a tightening labor market, and inflation moving up toward our 2 percent objective."
 Growth and inflation are low around the world.
" With interest rates so low, we are not well positioned to respond to negative shocks, whatever the source."
"  Longer -Run Challenges  Productivity and Growth Let’s turn to longer -run challenges , and start by asking w hy growth has been so slow , and how fast  we are likely to grow going forward ."
 This next slide shows the  fiveyear trailing average annual real GDP growth  rate (figure 8) .
" By this measure , growth averaged about 3.2 percent  annually through the 1970s , the 1980s , and the 1990s."
 But growth began to decline after 2000 and then nose -dived with  the onset of the G lobal Financial C risis in 2007 and the slow expansion that followed.
" Since the financial crisis  ended in 2009, forecasters have gradually reduced their estimates of long -run trend  - 6 - growth from about 3 percent  to about 2 percent --a seemingly small difference that would make a huge difference in living standards over time.3 How much of this decline is just a particu larly bad business cycle, and how much represents a long -run downshift?"
" To get at that question, l et’s take a deeper look at the growth slowdown."
 We can think of economic growth as coming from two sources:  more hours worked (labor supply) or higher output per hour (productivity).
" Hours worked mainly depends on growth in the labor force, which has been slowing since the mid2000s as the baby -boom generation ages."
" This long -expected  demographic fact  has now arrived, and it has challenging implications for our potential growth and also for our fiscal policy.4 The unexpected part of the growth slowdown reflects weak productivity growth rather than lower labor supply."
 Labor productivity has increased only 1/2 percent per year since 2010--the smallest five -year ra te of increase since World War II and about onefourth  of the  average postwar rate ( figure 11).
 The slowdown in productivity has been worldwide and is evident even in countries that were little affected by the crisis (figure 12).
"Powell (2016), “Recent Economic Developments, the Productive Potential of the Economy, and Monetary Policy,” speech delivered at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, Washington, D.C., May 26,  www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20160526a.htm ."
  - 7 - A portion of the productivity slowdown is  undoubtedly due to low levels of investment by businesses .
" If businesses expect s lower  growth  to continue, that will also hold down investment."
"   The other  important factor is the decline in what economists call total factor productivity , or TFP , which is the part of produ ctivity that is not explained by capital investment or increases in the skills of the labor force."
"  There is no consensus  about the future direction of productivity .5  The pessimist s argue that the bi g paradigm -changing innovations , such as electrification or the advent of computers , are behind us ."
 Still o thers argue that we are currently underestimating productivity and output because of the real difficulties we face in measurin g GDP in a modern economy.
 But I would sum up the growth discussion as follows .
" Growth in the labor force has slowed , and we can estimate it with reasonable                                                  5 On the pessimistic end of the spectrum are analysts such as Robert Gordon, The Rise and Fall of American Growth:   The U.S. Standard of Living s ince the Civil War  (Princeton University Press, 2016)."
"Reinsdorf (2016), “Does the United States Have a Productivity Slowdown or Measurement Problem?” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity,  March 4 , www.brookings.edu/bpea -articles/does -theunited -states -have -aproductivity -slowdown -ora-measurement -problem ."
 Growth in productivity is both more important and much harder to predict.
" Productivity varies significantly over time, as figure 11 showed."
" If productivity growth returns t o, say,  1.5 percent , then the U.S. economy could grow at  about 2.0 percent  over the long term."
" Actual growth may turn out to be weaker or stronger , and the choices we make as a society  will have something to say about that ."
" In fact, this next chart shows that , as growth and inflation have fallen, longer term interest rates  have fallen  as well over the past 35 years  (figure 13)."
 The FOMC has considerable control over short -term interest rates .
" Long -term interest rates represent  the price that balances  the supply of saving by  lenders and demand for funds by borrowers , such as businesses needing to fund their c apital expenditures ."
 Lenders expect to receive a real return and to be compensated for inflation and for the risk of nonpayment.
" Meanwhile, borrowers adjust their demand for funds based on their changing assessment of  the risks and expected return s of th eir investment projects."
"  When  desired saving rises or investment  - 9 - demand falls, then long -term interest rates will decline ."
     Both e xpectations of slower growth and the aging of our population are having significant effects on desired saving and investment and are thus important cause s of lower interest rates .
" If the economy is expanding more slowly, then the level of investment  needed to meet demand will be lowe r."
" The lower path of growth reduces future income prospects of households , and they will tend to raise their saving."
" In addition, the lower rate of return on capital owing to lower productivity growth will lead to less investment and lower interest rates."
" As with productivity, t he factors behind the fall in U.S. interest rates include  an important global component, as rates are low around the world."
" What can we do to prevent low growth, low  inflation , and low  interest rate s from becoming the new normal?"
 We need to  focus on ways to increase our longterm growth  and spread that prosperity as broadly as possible .
" We need polic ies that  support productivity growth, business hiring and investment, labor force participation , and the development of skills ."
" Increased spending on public infrastructure may raise private - - 10 - sector productivity over time, particularly with the growth of the stock of public infrastructure near an all -time low.7  Greater support for public and private research and development, and policies that improve product and labor marke t dynamism may also be fruitful .8  Monetary policy can contribute by supporting a strong and durable expansion in a context of price stabilit y."
    Monetary Policy  The low interest rate environment presents special challenges for monetary policy.
" In setting  our target for the  federal funds rate, a good place to start is  to identify  the rate that would prevail if the economy were at 2 percent inflation and full employment-- the so -called neutral rate."
" If the fed funds rate is lower than the neutral  rate, then policy is stimulative or accommodative , which will tend to raise growth and inflation ."
" If the fed funds rate is higher than the neutral rate, then policy is tight and will tend to slow growth and reduce inflation."
 Many analysts believe that the neutral rat e is even lower than that today  and will only return to its long -run value over time.9  The low level of the n eutral  interest rate has several important implications.
" First, today’s low rates are not as stimulative as they seem --consider that , despite historically low rates, inflation has run consistently below target a nd housing construction remains  far below pre -crisis levels ."
" Third, persistently low interest rates can r aise financial stability concerns."
" A long period of very low interest rates could lead to excessive risk -taking and, over time, to unsustainably high asset prices and credit growt h."
 Higher growth would increase the neutral rate and help address these issues.
" Turning to the outlook for monetary policy, incoming data show an economy that is growing at a healthy pace,  with solid payroll job gains and inflation gradually moving up to 2 percent ."
" With inflation below target, relatively slow growth , and some slack remaining in the economy, the Committee has been patient about raising rates."

" Today, we are reasonably close to achi eving ful l employment and our 2 percent  inflation objective."
" Our aging population will mean slower growth, all else held equal."
" If living standards are to continue to rise , we need policies that will support productivity and allow our dynamic economy to generate widespread gains in prosper ity."
