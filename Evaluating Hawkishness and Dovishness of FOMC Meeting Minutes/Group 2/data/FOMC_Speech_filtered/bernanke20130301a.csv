"For release on delivery  10:00 p.m. EST (7 p.m. PST)  March 1 , 2013         Long -Term Interest Rates     Remarks by   Ben S."
"Bernanke   Chairman   Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at the  Annual Monetary/Macroeconomics Conference:  The Past and  Future of Monetary Policy   Sponsored by Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco   San Francisco, California         March 1 , 2013   I will begin my remarks by posing a question:  Why are long -term interest rates so low in the United States and in other major industrial countries?"
"  At first blush, t he answer seems obvious:  C entral banks in those  countries are pursuing accommodative monetary policies to boost growth and reduce slack in their economies."
" However, while central banks  certainly  play a key role in determining the behavior of long -term interest rates, theirs is only a proximate influence."
 Let me start with a brief overview of the recent history of long -term interest rates in some  key econo mies .
" The similar behavior of these yields attests to the global nature of the economic and financial developments  of recent years, as well as to the  broad similar ity in how the  monetary policymakers  in the advanced economies  have responded to these developments."
" Of course, Japanese yields are clearly a case apart, as Japan has endured an extended period of deflation, while inflation in the other four countries has been positive and generally close to the stated objectives of the monetary aut horities."
"  In my comments, I will delve more deeply into the reasons why these long -term interest rates h ave fallen so low."
 Why Are Long -Term Interest Rates So Low?
" So, why are long -term interest rates currently so low?"
"  To help answer this question , it is useful to decompose longer -term yields into three components:  one reflecting expected inflation over the term of the security; another  capturing the expected path of short -term real, or inflation -adjusted, interest rates; and a residual component known as the term premium."
" That model employs the “arbitrage -free” term structure framework and jointly models real yields, nominal yields , and inflation as functions of four underlying latent factors."
" Historical data on nominal yields, real yields, an d inflation can be used to estimate these underlying factors and the relationship of real and nominal yields to the factors."
 The expected inflation component has drifted  gradually downward for many years and has become quite stable.
" In large part, the downward trend and stabilization of expected inflation in the United States are products of the increasing credibility of the Federal Reserve’s commitment to price stability."
" In January 2012, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) underscored this commitment by issuing a statement --since reaffirmed at its January 2013 meeting --on its longer -run goals and policy strategy, which included a longer -run inflation target of 2 percent.3  The anchoring of long -term inflation expectations near 2 percent has been a key factor influencing long -term interest rates over recent years."
 It almost certainly helped mitigate the strong disinflationary pressures immediately following the crisis.
" While I have not shown expected inflation for other advanced economies, the pictures would be very similar --again , except  for Japan."
" With the expected inflat ion component of the 10 -year rate near 2 percent and the rate itself a bit below 2 percent recently, it is clear that the combination of the other two components --the expected path of short -term real interest rates and the term premium --must make a small n et negative contribution."
" Note that i nflation in chart 2 is measured by the consumer price index ; inflation measured by this index is close to but on average slightly higher than inflation as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditure s, the measure to which the Fed eral Open Market Committee ’s 2 percent inflation objective refers."
" 3 See Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy , as amended effective on January  29, 2013 , at www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_LongerRunGoals.pdf ."
" - 4 - The expected path of short -term real interest rates is, of course, influenced by monetary policy, both the current stance of policy and market participants’ expectations of how policy will evolve."
" The stance of monetary policy at  any given time, in turn, is driven largely by the economic outlook, the risks surrounding that outlook, and at times other factors, such as whether the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates is binding."
" In the current environment, both policymakers a nd market participants widely agree that supporting the U.S. economic recovery while keeping inflation close to 2 percent will likely require real short -term rates, currently negative, to remain low for some time."
"4  As the persistence of the effects of the crisis have become clearer, the Federal Reserve’s communications have reinforced the expectation that conditions are likely to warrant highly accommodative pol icy for some time:  Most recently, the FOMC indicated that it expects to maintain an exceptionally low level of the federal funds rate at least as long as the unemployment rate is above 6.5 percent, projected inflation between one and two years ahead is no  more than a half percentage point above the Committee’s 2 percent target, and long -term inflation expectations remain stable.5 In discussing the role of monetary policy in determining the expected future path of real short -term rates, I have cheated a lit tle:  What monetary policy actually controls is                                                  4 Real interest rates are not constrained by the zero bound, and th e fact that expected average real short -term interest rates are near zero reflects that the nominal rate is expected, on average, to run close to the expected inflation rate, which is near 2 percent."
" However, because inflation adjusts slowly, control of nominal short -term rates usually translates into control of real short -term rates over the short and medium  term."
" In the longe r term, real interest rates are determined primarily by nonmonetary factors, such as the expected return to capital investments, which in turn is closely related to  the underlying strength of the economy."
" The fact that market yields currently incorporate an expectation of very low short -term real interest rates over the next 10  years suggests that market participants anticipate persistent ly slow  growth and , consequently,  low real returns  to investment ."
" In other words, the low level of expected real short rates  may reflect not only investor  expectations for a slow cyclical recovery  but also some downgrading of longer -term growth prospects.6 Chart 3, which display s yields on inflation -indexed, long -term government bonds for the same five countries represented in chart 1, shows that expected real yields over the longer term are low in other advanced industrial economies as well."
" While indexed yields spiked up around the end of 2008, reflecting market stresses at the height of the crisis that undercut the demand for these bonds, these eff ects dissipated in 2009."
" Since that time, inflation -indexed yields have declined steadily  and now stand below zero  in each country .7  Apparently,  low longer -term real rate expectations are playing an important role in accountin g for low 10 -year nominal ra tes in other industrial countries , as well as in the United States."
"                                                  6 Between April 2009 and October 2012, expectations for average growth over the next 10 years, as reported in Consensus Forecasts, have fallen about 0.2 percentage points for the United States."
" This  reduction in growth expectations is a broad ph enomenon:  Between April 2009 and October 2012, the average prediction for growth over the next 10 years for Canada, Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom has fallen between 0.1 and 0.6  percentage points."
"  - 6 - The third and final component of the long -term interest rate is the term premium, defined as the residual component not captured by expected real short -term rates or expected inflation."
" In part, the term premium compensates bondholders for interest rate risk --the risk of capital gains and losses that interest rate change s imply for the value of longer -term bonds."
 Two changes in the nature of this interest rate risk have probably contributed to a general downward movement of the term premium  in recent years.
" Second , the correlation of bond prices and stock prices has become increasingly negative over time, implying that bonds have becom e more valuable as a hedge against risks from holding other assets.8   Beyond interest rate risk, a number of other factors also affect the term premium  in practice ."
" For example, during periods of financial turmoil, the prices of longer -term Treasury secu rities are often driven up by so -called safe -haven demands of investors who place special value on the safety and liquidity of Treasury securities."
" Indeed, even during more placid periods, global demands for safe assets increase  the value of Treasury securities."
" The global economic and financial stresses of recent years --triggered first by  the financial crisis, and then by the problems in the euro  area--appear to have signific antly elevated the safehaven demand for Treasur y securit ies at times, pushing down Treasury yields and implying a lower , or even a negative , term premium.9   Federal Reserve actions have also affected term premiums in recent years, most prominently throug h a series of Large -Scale Asset Purchase (LSAP) programs."
" To the extent that Treasur y securit ies and agency -guaranteed  securities are not perfect substitut es for  other assets, Federal Reserve purchases of these assets should lower their term premiums, putting downward  pressure on longer -term interest rates and easing financial conditions more broadly."
" For example, the Treasury term premium is likely also depressed by the global demand for Treasury securities for use as collateral or margin in funding or derivatives markets."
" Long -term interest rates are the sum of expected inflation, expected real short -term interest rates, and a term premium ."
" Expected inflation has been  low and stable, r eflecting central bank mandates and credibility as well as considerable resource slack in the major industrial economies."
" Real interest rates are expected to remain low , reflecting the weakness of the recovery  in advanced economies  (and possibly some down grading of longer -term growth prospects  as well )."
" This weakness, all else being equal, dictates that monetary policy must  remain accommodative  if it is  to support the recovery and reduce disinflationary risks."
" However, i t is now a bedrock principle of central banking that transparency about  - 9 - the likely path of policy, in general, and interest rates , in particular , can increase the effectiveness of policy."
"If, as the FOMC anticipates, the economic recovery continues at a moderate pace, with unemployment slowly declining and inflation expectations remaining near 2 percent , then longterm interest rates would be expected to rise gradually toward more normal levels over the next several years."
" Finally, the purple  line shows  a forecast based on the term structure model used for the decomposition of the 10 -year yield in chart 2.12  While these forecasts embody a wide range of underlying models and assumptions, the basic message is clear --longterm interest rates are expected to rise gradually over the next few years, rising  (at                                                  12 This projection assumes that two key components of the 10year Treasury yield shown in chart 2 --the expected average real short -rate and the term premium --revert to their respective mean levels over the period 2000 to 200 6 during the next 5 years; the expected average inflation component is assumed to remain constant near the 2 percent level prevailing at the end of 2012."
" The dark gray bars in the chart are based on the range of forecasts reported in the Blue Chip Financial Forecasts, the blue bars are based on the historical uncertainty regarding long -term interest rates as reflected in the Board staff’s FRB/US  model  of the U.S. economy , and the orange  bars give a market -based measure of uncertainty derived from swaptions."
" Note, though,  that while the risk of an unexp ected rise in interest rates has drawn much attention, the level of long -term interest rates also could prove to be lower than forecast."
" For example, in 1994, 10 -year Treasury yields rose about 220 basis points over the course of a year, reflecting an unexpected quickening in th e pace of economic growth and signs of building inflation pressures."
" Th is increase in long -term rates appears to have reflected a mix of a pronounced rise  in the expected path of the  - 11 - policy interest rate and some increase  in the term premium.13  A rise of more than 200 basis points in a year is at the upper end of what is implied by the mean paths and uncertainty measures shown in charts 4 and 5 , but these measures still admit a substantial probability of  higher --and lower --paths."
" Managing Risks Associated with the Future Course of Long -Term Interest Rates  As I noted when I began my remarks, one reason to focus on the timing and pace of a possible increase in  longterm rates is that these outcomes may have implications for  financial stability."
"  Notably, i n this episode, the rise in rates created some stress in financial markets but did not lead to serious financial instability, nor did it significantly impair economic activity."
" Of course, t he two risks may very well be mutually reinforcing :  Taking on duration risk is one way investors may reach for yield, and the losses resulting from a sharp rise in longer -term rates will be  greater if investors have done so.15  One might argue that the right response to these risks is to tighten monetary policy, raising long -term interest rates with the aim of forestalling any undesirable buildup of risk."
" Long -term interest rates in the major  industrial countries are low for good reason:  Inflation is low and stable and, given expectations of weak growth, expected real short rates are low."
" Throughout the Federal Reserve System, w ork in these areas is conducted by experts in banking, financial markets, monetary policy, and other disciplines, and  at the Federal Reserve Board  we have established our Office for Financial Stability Policy and Research to help coordinate this work ."
 Findings a re presented regularly  to the Board and to the FOMC  for use in its monetary policy deliberations .
" In a related exercise, we  are also asking banks to stress -test the adequacy of their capital in the face of a hypothetica l sharp upward shift in the term structure of interest rates."
" Third, our approach to communicating and implementing monetary policy provides the Federal Reserve with new tools that could  potentially be used to  mitigate the risk of sharp increases in intere st rates ."
" In 1994 --the period discussed earlier in which sharp increases in interest rates strained financial markets --the FOMC ’s communication tools were very limited; indeed, it had just begun issuing public statements following policy moves."
" By contra st, in recent years, the Federal Reserve has provided a great deal of additional information about its expectations for the path of the economy and the stance of monetary policy."
" Most recently,  as I mentioned,  the FOMC announced unemployment and inflation  thresholds characterizing conditions that will guide the timing of the first increase in the target for the federal funds rate."
"  Further, the FOMC stated that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy is likely to remain appropriate for a considera ble time after our current asset purchase program ends."
" By providing greater clarity concerning  the likely course of the federal funds rate , FOMC  communication should both  make policy more effective and reduce the risk that market misperceptions of the Co mmittee’s intentions  would lead to unnecessary interest rate volatility."
"  In particu lar, adjustments to the pace or timing of asset sales could be used, under some circumstances, to dampen excessively sharp  adjustments in longer -term interest rates."
" On the one hand, the Fed’s dual mandate has led  us to provide strong support for the recovery, both to promote maximum employment and to keep inflation from falling below our price stability objective."
 One purpose of this support is to prompt a return to the productive risk -taking that is essential to robust growth and  to getting the unemployed back to work.
" On the other hand, we must be mindful  of the possibility  that sustained periods of low interest rates and highly accommodative policy could lead to excessive risk -taking  in some financial markets ."
" In light  of the  moderate  pace of the recov ery and the continued high level of economic slack , dialing back accommodation with the goal of deterring excessive risk -taking in some areas  poses its own risks to growth, price stability, and, ultimately , financial stability."
" We will, however, be evaluating these issues carefully and on an ongoing basis ; we will be alert for any developments that pose risks to the achievement of the Federal Reserve ’s mandated objectives of price stability and maximum employment; a nd we will , of course , remain prepared to use all of our tools as needed to address  any such developments ."
