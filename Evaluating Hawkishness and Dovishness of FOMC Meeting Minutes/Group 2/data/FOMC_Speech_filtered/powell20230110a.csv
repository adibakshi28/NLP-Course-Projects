" First, the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy independence is an important and broadly supported institutional arrangement that has served the American public well."
" Second, the Fed must continuously earn that independence by using our tools to achieve our assigne d goals of maximum employment and price stability, and by providing t ransparen cy to facilitate understanding and effective oversight by the public and their elected representatives in Congress ."
"Central bank independence and transparency  On the first point, t he case for monetary policy independence lies in the benefits of insulating monetary poli cy decisions from short -term political considerations .1  Price stability is the bedrock of a healthy economy and provides the public with immeasurable benefits over time."
 But restoring price stability when inflation is high can require  measures that are not popular in the short term  as we raise interest rates to slow the economy.
" I believe that the benef its of independent monetary policy in the U.S. context are well understood and broadly accepted.2  1 In the past several decades, support for arrangements in which central banks made monetary policy decisions in  pursuit of legislated goals of economic and price stability has been  buttressed by theoretical and empirical research contributions, including by Kenneth Rogoff, on the benefits of central bank independence."
" This continuous dialogue goes well beyond the regular testimony, established by statute, in which I report to the congressional committees that have oversight responsibilities regarding monetary policy."
" The existence of the dual mandate reflects the fact that the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy independence corresponds to operational, or instrument, independence, rather than goal independence."
"But without explicit congressional legislation, it would be inappropriate for  us to use our monetary policy or supervisory  tools to promote a greener economy or to achieve other climate -based goals.7  We are not, and will not be, a “climate policymaker .”    5 Like our monetary policy independence,  our independence in this area comes with a high level of transparency about our policies and proce dures ."
" 7 While U.S. monetary policy has the dual mandate  of maximum employment and price stability, some other central banks have somewhat more expansive mandates."
