"  The Rebound in Economic Growth and Capital Flows  in Emerging Market s  After real GDP growth plummeted in many EMEs du ring the Global Financial Crisis ( GFC ), economic activity rebounded sharply (slide 1)."
" But that recovery proved to be short  lived and was followed by a notable, widespread fall in EME growth as advanced economies remained sluggish, economic imbalances in China mounted, and commodity prices plunged."
" Lately, however, the streak of weak growth in the EMEs                                                  1 For more on this linkage, see Powell (2013)."
"   - 2 - appears to have been broken:  The downward trend in Chinese growth has flattened, growth in other EMEs has picked up some, and Brazil seems to be moving into recovery mode."
" Part of t his retrenchment reflected Chinese net inflows turning into net outflows due to what might be considered special circumstances —notably , changes in expectations of Chinese exchange rate policy."
" In a recent study, Federal Reserve staff regress ed net private capital inflows into several key EMEs on measures of investment opportunities in these economies, monetary policy va riables, and risk sentiment variables.3  As can be seen in slide 5 , by comparing the solid and dashed lines, the model does a fairly good job overall of fitting the data."
" Note that the falloff in commodity prices (the red portion of the                                                  3 The specific variables in the regression include the GDP growth differential between EMEs and advanced economies, commodity prices, EME interest rate differentials with advanced economies, measures of the Federal Reserve’s quantitative easing, the VIX  (which is the  onemonth -ahead optionimplied volatility of the S&P 500 index ), and country -specific emerging market credit spread s (see Clark and oth ers, 2016)."
 The decline in economic growth differentials between the EMEs and advanced economies (the yellow portions) was also a major contributor .
" In fact, growth differentials became a slightly negative contributor in 2015 after being substantially positive in 2010.4  Monetary policies (the blue portions) also became less of a factor in 2015 in driving flows  to EMEs.   As for the recent rebound in flows, over the past year the model’s predicted net inflows (the dashed line) have actually been significantly above actual net inflows (the solid line), suggesting that there is some room for flows to increase further without raising concerns."
" The growth differential is not playing a major role because the rise in EME growth has been accompanied by a rise in advanced -economy growth.5   All in all, this evidence suggests that the recent pickup of capital flows to EMEs has not outrun it s fundamental determinants, which provides some encouragement that these flows will not reverse themselves and endanger EME prospects, a situation that is also encouraging for U.S. prospects."
"                                                   4 This negative contribution reflects that the average growth dif ferential between the selected group of EMEs, which does not include China, and the advanced economies itself became negative."
   - 5 - Risks to E merging M arket E conomy Prospects from the Future Cou rse of Monetary Policy  Some observers have noted that the risk of a reversal of EME capital flows may become more pronounced as U.S. and global interest rates return to more normal levels.
" These developments could encourage capital to return to the advanc ed economies and , by raising domestic interest rates and putting downward pressures on emerging market currencies , could also enlarge EME debt burdens."
" Emerging M arket E conomy  Vulnerabilities  There is clear empirical evidence that the response of EME financial markets to different shocks, including changes in U.S. interest rates, depends importantly on the state of economic fundamentals in the EMEs themselves."
" For example, Bowman and coauthors  document in their study that a deterioration in a country’s economic conditions significantly increases its vulnerability to adverse effects from changes in U.S. interest rates.6  A case in point is the socalled taper tantrum in 2013, when rises in sover eign bond spreads were significantly greater in those EMEs with greater relative vulnerabilities."
" Observers have been expressing concerns about the mounting levels of corporate debt and the risk that a normalization of global conditions could exacerbate debt service burdens of EME corporations --particularly those with elevated levels of dollar -denominated debt --by raising global interest rates, boosting the value of the dollar, and perhaps damping economic activity."
" On the other hand, Chinese corporates are much less exposed to changes in exchange rates and global interest rates."
"                                                   7 Variables used in creating the index include external debt, the current account position, foreign reserves, public debt, control of inflation, and bank credit to the private sector."
" Although on the face of it, this shock does not seem too large, as discussed in Beltran and others (2017), it is applied to the averag e interest rate on the entire existing debt, not just on new debt."
" Given that the average interest rate for EME  firms is about 43/4 percent, a 1 percentage point rise increases the interest expense by about a fifth ."
"  12 In computing the new debt -atrisk after exchange rate shocks, we need the share of debt that is foreign currencydenominated, which is taken from Ayala, Nedelijkovic, an d Saborowski (2015) ."
"   - 9 - that U.S. monetary policy normalization has been and should continue to be gradual, as long as the U.S. economy evolves roughly as expect ed."
  The expectation of gr adual policy normalization should reduce the likelihood of outsized movements in interest rates.
" And, as we saw earlier, interest rate changes of this magnitude should not lea d to generalized corporate distress in EMEs, although undoubtedly some corporates are more exposed and could experience difficulties."
  Most of the time bouts of market turbulence lead to relatively quick corrections that leave markets more resilient without substantially depressing global growth.
" Although, EME vulnerabilities have been rising, they are still well below the levels of the crisis -                                                 13 The IMF’s most recent Global Financial Stability Report , released October 11, (IMF, 2017), also concludes that EMEs should be able to handle any reduction in flows from global monetary policy normalization “in a relatively smooth manner, given their enhanced resilience and stronger growth outlook.”   - 11 - prone  years of the 1980s and 1990s ."
