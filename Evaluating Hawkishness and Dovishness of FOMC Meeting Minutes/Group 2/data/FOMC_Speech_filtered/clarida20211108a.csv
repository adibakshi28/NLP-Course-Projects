Monetary Policy     Remarks by   Richard H.
"Clarida   Vice Chair   Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at the   Symposium on Monetary Policy Frameworks  The Brookings Institution   Washington, D.C.  (via webcast)         November 8, 2021       Outlooks and Outcomes  for the U.S. Economy  The U.S. economy in the second quarter of this year made the transition from economic recovery to economic expansion.1  Given the catastrophic collapse in U .S."
"economic activity in the first half of 2020 as a result of the global pandemic and the mitigation effort s put in place to contain it, few forecasters could have expected —or even dared to hope —in the spring of last year that the recovery in gross domestic product (GDP ), from the sharpest decline in activity since the Great Depression , would be either so robus t or as rapid."
"  Indeed, the National Bureau of Economic Research ’s Business Cycle Dating Committee determined in July that the recession that began in March of last year ended in April, making it not only the deepest recession on record,  but also the briefest.2  The recovery that commenced in the summer of 2020 was quite robust, and , with one quarter to go,  GDP growth in 2021  is projected by the Fed and many outside forecasters to be the fastest since 1983 ."
" That said, under the median projection for GDP grow th in the September Summary of Economic projections, the level of real GDP will have returned to its pre pandemic trend growth trajectory  by the fourth  quarter  1 The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of other Federal Reserve Board members or Federal Open Market Committee  participants."
"  - 2 - of 2021 , which if realized would represent  one of the most rapid such recoveries  in 50 years.3 In the September  SEP round, my individual projections for GDP growth , the unemployment rate , inflation, and the policy rate path turned out to be quite close to the path of SEP medians for each of these variables over the 2021 –24 projection window."
" Under the se projections, GDP growth step s down from 5.9 percent this year to 3.8 percent in 2022 and further to  2.5 percent and 2 percent in 2023  and 2024 , respectively ."
" Not surprisingly, the projected path of above -trend  GDP growth in 2021 and 2022  trans lates into rapid declines in the projected path for the unemployment rate, which is projected to fall to 3.8 percent by the end of 2022 and 3.5 percent by the  end of 2023."
" This modal projection for the path of the unemployment rate is, according to the Atlanta Fed jobs calculator , consistent with a rebound in labor force participation to its estimated demographic trend and is also consistent with cumulative employment gains this year and next that, by the end of 2022, eliminate the 4.2 million “employment gap” relative to the previous cycle peak.4  My projections for headline and core PCE (personal consumption expenditures) inflation are , alas, also similar to the median SEP numbers ."
" Under the projected SEP path for inflation, core PCE inflation surges to at least 3.7 percent this year before reverting back to 2.3 percent in 2022, 2.2 percent in 2023 , and 2.1 percent  in 2024 ."
" Thus, the baseline outlook for inflation over the three -year projection window reflects the judgment, shared with many outside forecasters, that  under appropriate monetary policy,  3 The most recent SEP, released following the conclusion of the September 2021 F OMC meeting, is available on the Board’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm ."
"  - 3 - most of the inflation overshoot relative to the longer -run goal of 2 percent will, in the end, prove to be transitory."
" Although in a number of sectors of the economy the imbalances between demand and supply —including labor supply —are substantia l, I do continue to judge that these imbalances are likely to dissipate over time as the labor market and global supply chains eventually adjust and, importantly, do so without putting persistent upward pressure on price inflation  and wage gains adjusted f or productivity."
" First,  realized PCE inflation so far this  year represents , to me , much more than a “moderate” overshoot of our 2 percent longer -run inflation objective , and I would not consider a repeat performance nex t year a policy success."
"  Second, as always, there are risks to any outlook, and I and 12 of my colleagues  believe that the risks to the outlook for inflation are to the upside."
" Prospects for U.S. Monetary Policy  In September 2020 , the FOMC introduced —and since then has  reaffirmed —outcome -based, threshold guidance that specifies three conditions that the Committee expects will be met before it considers increasing the target range for the federal funds rate, currently 0 to 25 basis points.5  This guidance in September of last year brought the forward guidance on the federal funds rate in the statement into alignment with the new flexible average inflation targeting framework adopted in August 2020.6  To quote from  5 The FOMC statement s containing the guidance (see the fourth paragraph in each statement) are  available on the Board’s websi te at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm ."
" 6 The revised Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, unanimously approved on August  27, 2020 , is available on the Board’s website at https://www.federalreserv e.gov/monetarypolicy/review -ofmonetary -policy -strategy -toolsand-   - 4 - the statement, th ese conditions are that “labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessment s of maximum employment  and inflation has risen to 2 percent  and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time .”   While we are clearly a ways away from considering raising interest rates , if the outlook s for inflation and unemployment I summarized a moment ago  turn out to be the actual outcome s realized over the forecast horizon, then I believe that these three necessary conditions for raising the target range for the federal funds rate will have been met by yearend 2022 .7  Core PCE inflation since February 2020 —a calculation window that smoot hs out any base effects resulting from “round trip” declines and rebounds in the price levels of COVID -19sensitive sectors and, coincidentally, also measures the average rate of core PCE inflation since hitting the effective lower bound (ELB) in March 2020—is running at 2.8 percent through September  2021  and is projected to remain  moderately above 2 percent in all three years of the projection window."
"  Moreover, my inflation project ions for 202 3 and 2024, which forecast inflation rates similar to  the SEP medians, would by year -end 2022 , to me , satisfy the “on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time ” threshold  specified in the statement."
" Finally, while my assessment of maximum employment incorporate s a wide range of indicators to assess  the state of the labor market —including indicators of labor compensation, productivity, and price -cost markups —the employment data  I look at , such as the Kansas City Fed’s Labor Market Conditions Ind icators , are historically highly correlated with the  communications -statement -onlonger -rungoals -monetary -policy -strategy.htm ."

   - 5 - unemployment rate .8  My expectation today is that the labor market by the end of 2022 will have reach ed my assessment of maximum employment if the unemployment rate has declined by then to the SEP median of modal projections of 3.8  percent.
" Given this econom ic outlook and so long as inflation expectations remain well anchored at the 2 percent longer -run goal —which, based on the Fed staff’s common inflation expectations  (CIE)  index, I judge  at present to be the case —a policy normalization path similar to the m edian SEP dot  plot on page 4 of our September 2021 projections  would , under these conditions,  be entirely consistent , to me,  with our new flexible average inflation targeting framework  and the policy rate reaction function I discussed in remarks here at Brookings in November 2020 .9  In the context of our new framework, it is important to note that while the ELB can be a constrain t on monetary policy, the ELB is not a constraint on fisc al policy , and appropriate monetary policy under our new framework , to me , must —and certainly can —incorporate this reality."
" Indeed, under present circumstances, I judge that the support to aggregate demand from fiscal policy —including the rough ly $2 trillion in accumulated  excess saving s accruing from (as yet) unspent transfer payments —in tandem  with appropriate monetary policy, can fully offset the constraint, highlighted in our Statement o n Longer -Run Goals  and Monetary Policy Strategy , that the ELB  impose s on the ability of  inflation -targeting monetary policy, acting on its own  and in the absence of sufficient fiscal support , to  8 The Labor Market Conditions Indi cators can be found on the Kansas City Fed’s website at https://www.kansascityfed.org/data -andtrends/labor -market -conditions -indicators ."
"  - 6 - restore , following a recession , maximum employment  and price stability  while keeping inflation expectations well anchored at the 2 percent longer -run goal.10 Before I conclude, let me say a few words about our Treasury and mortgage -backed securities  (MBS) purchase programs."
" In our December 2020 FOMC statement, we indicated  that we would maintain the pace of Treasury and MBS purchases at $80 billion and $40 billion per month, respectively, until “substantial further progress” has been made toward our maximum -employment and price -stability goals ."
