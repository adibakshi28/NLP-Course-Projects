 Deposit growth has outpaced loan demand  and reli ance on wholesale funding has been reduced.
" The interest margin pressure banks face today is partly due to low interest rates and partly due to weak loan demand, both of which are consequences of a s luggish economy."
" For instance, it is not surprising that community banks operating in markets experiencing high unemployment rates have been less profitable since the financial crisis ."
" This pattern is consistent with previous  Federal Reserve  studies, which found  that bank performance is heavily affected by the local econom y, but I think it is important to note that even in states with high unemployment rates or sharp declines in property values, some community banks were able to thrive."
" And t hriving banks did more than just rate well with  supervisors --the thriving bank s outperformed the surviving bank s on a wide range of performance in dicators , including return on assets , return on equity, loan losses, provision expense, efficiency ratio, asset growth, net interest margin , and net noninterest margin."
" In the planning  process , banks should define the portion of the lending portfolio they plan to allocate to different loan categories, the investments they are willing to make to develop expertise and to manage credit and compliance risk , and the levels of credit and interest rate risk they are willing to assume."
" While I certainly understand their frustration, I still believe that community  bankers can respond within the new environment by creating products that are profitable and meet the needs of their customers, while still manag ing their interest rate and funding risk s."
" As you may know, in 2006 the federal banking agencies issued supervisory guidance that set fo rth screening criteria based on certain types of CRE concentrations and rapid growth of CRE portfolios.14  These guidelines contained specific numerical thresholds for the ratios of construction and total CRE  lending to an institution ’s total capital, as well as for identifying rapid growth of such lending.15  These criteria were never intended to result in hard caps, but were instead meant to trigger conversations between a bank and its supervisors about the  bank’s ability to manage the risks arising from these concentrations."
" Moreover, it was apparent that banks that exceeded the criterion for construction and land developm ent were far more likely to have failed  over the period  from 2007 to 2011 than were those banks that exceeded the criterion for overall CRE exposures and portfolio growth."
" We now recognize the importance of  the rapid growth criterion, which may have recei ved less attention than the criteria for construction and overall CRE lending concentrations."
