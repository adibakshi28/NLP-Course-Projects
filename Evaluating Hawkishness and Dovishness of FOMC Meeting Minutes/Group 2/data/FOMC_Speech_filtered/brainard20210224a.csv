"For release on delivery  10:30 a.m. EST  February 24, 2021         How Should We Think about Full Employment in the Federal Reserve’s Dual Mandate?"
" So the one message I hope you remember from today is that economics provides powerful tools to enable you to analyze and affect the issues that matter most to you.1 With jobs down by 10 million relative to pre -pandemic levels, one issue that matters fundamentally to  all of us is achieving full employment."
 So today I want to talk about both the Federal Reserve’s responsibilities with regard to full employment and different approaches to assessing where we are relative to that goal.
  The belief that the federal government has a responsibility for full employment has its roots in the Great Depression.
" It was given statutory expression at the end of the Second World War when policymakers and legislators feared that the millions of American soldiers returning to the lab or market would face Depression -era conditions.2  In the Employment Act of 1946, the Congress directed the federal government as a whole to pursue “conditions under which there will be afforded useful employment for those able, willing, and seeking work, and to promote maximum employment, production, and purchasing power.”3    1 I am grateful to Kurt Lewis, Mark Carlson, Christopher Nekarda, Edward Nelson, Ivan Vidangos, and Nicholas Zevano ve of the Federal Reserve Board for their assistance in preparing th ese materials ."

"Garfield, Emanuel Alexandrovich  Goldenweiser, Everett Einar  Hagen , and Board of Governors of the Federal  - 2 - The postwar policy discussion raised important issues surrounding the definition and measurement of full employment."
" In 1950, t he Review of Economics and Statistics  published a symposium titled “How Much Unemployment?” which debated the accuracy of the Census Bureau’s value for unemployment.4  Dr. Palmer was a critical contributor to the symposium."
" Palmer was a professor at Wharton, a fellow of the American Statistical Association,  a worldwide expert on manpower and labor mobility, and a consultant with the Office of Statistical Standards.5  She argued that “ a single  figure of unemployment, regardless of how it is defined or derived, is inadequate as a basis for selection among [policy] programs."
"”6   With concerns about  employment  again on the rise,  in 1976, Senator  Hubert Humphrey joined with Congressman Augustus Hawkins to sponsor legislation promot ing full employment.7   An amendment to the  Federal Reserve Act in 1977 specifically assigned monetary policy  responsibility for promoting “the goals of maximum employm ent, stable prices, and moderate longterm interest rates ,” commonly referred to  Reserve System , eds.,  Jobs, Producti on, and Living Standards (Baltimore:   Waverly Press) , p."

"   - 3 - as the dual mandate .8  This amendment was followed by the HumphreyHawkins Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act , passed in 1978, requiring that the Federal Reserve regularly report to the Congress on how monetary policy was supporting the goals  of the act.9   Congressman Hawkins was a prominent advocate of full employment, emphasizing its importance not only for providing a job to every American seeking work, but also for reducing poverty, inequality, discrimination, and crime and improving the quality of life of all people.10  A congressman from southern California, Hawkins was one of the founders of the Congress ional Black Caucus and played a major role in the drafting of the Civil Rights Act of 1964."
" He was also influenced by the work of economists such as Robert Browne and Bernard Anderson, which highlighted the persistent disparity between Black and white employment and the connection between  8 As noted by Frederic Mishkin, “ Because long -term interest rates can remain low only in a stable macroeconomic environment, these goals are often referred to as the dual mandate ; that is, the Federal Reserve seeks to promote the two coequal objectives of maximum employment and price stability.”   See Frederic S."
"Mishkin (2007) “ Monetary Policy and the Dual Mandate ,” speech delivered  at Bridgewater College, B ridgewater, Va., April 10 (quoted text in paragraph 3), https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/mishkin20070410a.htm ."
"9 A few other central banks have an explicit employment mandate that has the same weight as their pricestability  mandate, such as  the Reserve Bank of Australia and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand ."
" For m ost central banks , price stability is the single objective of monetary policy (Bank of Canada, Riksbank , and Bank of Japan ) or the priority objective ( for example,  European Central Bank and  Bank of England)."
" Economic r esearch suggests that inflation outcomes have been as good, or better , in the United States compared with jurisdictions in which  employment either is not  a monetary policy objective or is subordinate  to price stability."

" - 4 - elevated Black unemployment and economic challenges facing Black communities.11  Hawkins emphasized that “without genuine full employment it would be impossible to eliminate racial discrimination in the provision of job  opportunities.”12  The HumphreyHawkins Act noted that “i ncreasing job opportunities and full employment would greatly contribute to the  elimination  of discrimination based upon s ex, age, race, color, religion, national  origin, handicap, or  other  improper  factors."
"”13 The centrality of achieving full employment for all Americans is as pressing today as it was in 1930, 1946, and 1977."
" And the statutory dual mandate assigned to monetary policy has ensured an unwavering, strong focus on maximum employment as well as price stability at the Federal Reserve in research and measuremen t no less than policymaking."
"  The Federal Reserve recently concluded a review of our monetary policy framework , which included extensive outreach to a broad range of people over the course of 2019."

   - 5 - their communities.14  They challenged whether the overall economy could be characterized as at “full employment” while unemployment remained in the double digits in their communities.
"  Reflecting this input, and in light of persistently below -target inflation, low equilibrium interest rates, and low sensitivity of inflation to resource utilization, we made several important changes to the monetary policy framework."
"Two changes have particular relevance for the employment leg of the dual mandate.15   The new framework calls for monetary policy to seek to eliminate shortfalls  of employment from its maximum level, in contrast to the previous approach that called for policy to minimize deviations  when employment is too high as well as too low."
 The new fra mework also defines the maximum level of employment as a broad -based and inclusive goal assessed through a  wide range of indicators .
 So how should we assess this broadbased and inclusive concept of maximum employment?
" When discussing aggregate indicator s about the labor market, people tend to focus on the headline U -3 measure of the unemployment rate.16  Although the unemployment rate is a very informative aggregate indicator, it provides only one narrow measure of where the labor market is relative to maximum employment."
" 15 See Lael Brainard (2021), “Full Employment in the New Monetary Policy Framew ork,” speech delivered at the Inaugural Mike McCracken Lecture on Full Employment , sponsored by the Canadian Association for Business Economics  (via webcast) , January 13, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/brainard20210113a.htm ."
   - 6 - rather consulting a variety of indicators that together provide a holistic picture of where we are relative  to full employment.
 So let us start by seeing what insights we gain by disaggregating the unemployment data into different groups of workers.
 The unemployment rate has improved very rapidly from its peak of 14.8 percent last April to 6.3 percent today.
" But this number is closer to 6.8 per cent when taking into account a substantial number of people on temporary layoff, who have been misclassified  as “employed but on unpaid absence”  but instead should be counted as unemployed.” 17  Disaggrega ting the overall unemployment rate reveal s that workers in the lowest wage quartile face Depression -era rates  of unemployment of around 23 percent .18  In part, this rate likely reflects the concentration of lower -wage jobs in service industries that are strong ly reliant on in -person contact, or at least in -person work, while a larger proportion of higher -wage jobs are currently being performed remotely or with reduced levels of in -person contact."
  There is also important information in the disaggregation of un employment by different racial and ethnic groups.
" Figure 1 shows the prime -age unemployment rate overall and on a disaggregated basis.19  There are notable persistent gaps between  17 Since March 2020, the Bur eau of Labor Statistics (BLS) has instructed its household survey interviewers to classify employed persons who are absent from work due to temporary, pandemic -related business closures or cutbacks as being unemployed on temporary layoff."
"  Each month, the BLS provides an estimate of the likely size of this effect on the unemployment rate."
 More information is available on the BLS website at https://www.bls.gov/covid19/employment -situation -covid19 -faqjanuary -2021.htm .
"18 For more information on this analysis, see the box “Disparities in Job Loss during the Pandemic ” in Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2021), Monetary Policy Report  (Washington:  Board of Governors, February), pp."
"  For example, historically, the ratio of the Black unemployment rate to the white unemployment rate is around 2 for prime -age workers."
" On average, a 1  percentage point increase in the white unemployment rate is accompanied by a  2 percentage point increase in the Black unemployment rate."
" At the beginning of 2015, a time when many economists believed the overall unemployment rate had reached its “normal” rate, the  gap between the Black and white prime -age unemployment rates stood just under 5 percentage points, roughly at its average level since 1972."
" By September 2019, that gap had reached a historical minimum of 1.7 percentage points, and the gap between the His panic and white prime -age unemployment rates had fallen to 0.3 percentage point."
  The unemployment  gaps between racial and ethnic groups widened again during the pandemic.
" Currently, for prime -age individuals, the gaps between the white unemployment rate  and the Black and Hispanic unemployment rates are roughly 4 percentage points and 3 percentage points, respectively."
 The unemployment rate obscures  important information about people leaving and entering the workforce.
" The unemployment rate is the number of individuals who are not currently working but are actively looking for a job, divided by the size of the labor force, which includes only those people who a re either working or actively seeking work:  𝑈𝑈=𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝑈𝑈𝐿𝐿 𝐹𝐹𝑈𝑈𝐿𝐿𝐹𝐹𝑈𝑈."
     - 8 - Changes in labor force participation contain important information about the strength of the labor market that is not captured in the unemployment rate.
"When we take into consideration the more than 4 million workers who have left the labor force since the pandemic started, as well as misclassification, the unemployment rate is close to 10 percent currently —much higher than the headline unemployment rate of 6.3 percent —and similar to the  peak unemployme nt rate following the financial crisis."
"  For more information on this analysis, see the box “Disparities in Job Loss during the Pandemic ” in Board of Governors, Monetary Policy Report,  pp."
"  - 9 - participation rate for prime -age women could have longer -term implications for household incomes and potential growth.21   While there are long -term structural trends in pa rticipation, such as population aging, there are also cyclical dynamics that are important for our assessment of maximum employment."
 The two panels in figure 3 show prime -age unemployment and labor force participation over the previous recession and recovery.
" Following the onset of the global financial crisis, as the number of unemployed people was rising, the size of the labor force was also contracting, pushing the numerator of the unemployment rate up and the denominator down."
" When the unemployment ra te started to decline at the end of 2010, this decline in part reflected unemployed people dropping out of the labor force through 2013."
" The  subseq uent seemingly modest decline in the unemployment rate from 4.3 at the end  of 2015 to 3 percent at the end of 2019 was much more significant, taking into account that  more than 3 -1/2 million prime -age workers joined or rejoined the labor force  during that period."
"    This brings me to figure 4 and the employment -topopulation (EPOP) ratio, which is the number of individuals employed divided by the working -age population:  𝐸𝐸𝐿𝐿𝐸𝐸𝐿𝐿= 𝐸𝐸𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝐿𝐿𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑃𝑃𝑈𝑈𝐿𝐿𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈."
 - 10 - The EPOP ratio synthesizes the informat ion contained in the unemployment rate and LFPR.
" For instance, as you can see in figure 4 , a decline in participation almost entirely offset the decline in unemployment in 2010 and 2011, leaving the prime -age EPOP ratio essentially flat at 75  percent."
" A glance back at figure 3 shows that the reductions in employment last spring were accompanied by many prime -age workers leaving the labor force, and the participation rate among prime -age workers has declined further since last May."
" That gap closed in 2015, and employment for both groups surged over the next four years."
" The part -time for economic rea sons (PTER) indicator shown in f igure 7 measures those who are working part time because they are unable to find a full -time job or whose hours ha ve been reduced and who would prefer full -time employment.25  This indicator is an important  23 See Connor Maxwell and Danyelle Solomon  (2020),  “The Economic Fallout of the Coronavirus for People of Color,” Center for American Progress, April 14, https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/race/news/2020/04/14/483125/economic -fallout -coronavirus -people -color ."
" Their usual hours of work  - 12 - measure of labor market slack, which tends to jump rapidly during recessions and improve more slowly than headline unemployment during recoveries."
" PTER jumped during the financial crisis as workers who were unable to secure  fulltime employment moved to part -time work, ac counting for more than half of the increase in involuntary parttime work  during 2008.26   Today there are 6.0 million people working part time who would prefer full -time work, up 1.6 million relative to the pre -COVID level."
" The Bureau of Labor Statistics has six alternative measures of labor underutilization, the most expansive of which is the U -6 measures, which adds to the headline unemployment rate those employed part time for economic reasons, along with all persons marginally attached to the labor force as a percentage of the civilian labor force."
" T he incidence of involuntary part -time work was especially notable for Hispanic workers at the trough of the Great Recession, nearing 12 percent of employment and almost double its rate before the recession."
" Economic reasons include the following:  slack work, unfav orable business conditions, inability to find full -time work, and seasonal declines in demand."
"  - 13 - parttime employment rates remain for Blacks, as well as Hispanics, relative to white s after controlling for age, education, marital status, and state of residence , although education and occupation can explain a portion of the gap for Hispanics.28  Before concluding, I would like to point to two other labor market indicators that provide useful evidence of the extent of labor market slack."
" The quits rate, shown in figure 9, is a measure of voluntary separations that provides information about how confident people are that they will be successful in finding a new job they prefer and, relatedly, of how aggressively firms are pursuing talent.29  Research indicates that the quits rate and wage growth are highly correlated, suggesting that these voluntary jobto-job transitions reflect individuals moving up a “job ladder” to higher -paying jobs.30  The quits rate fell rapidly during the 2008 recession as workers’ options became more limited, then recovered slowly, only surpassing its pre –financial crisis level of roughly 2.5 percent in 2018."
"Jason Faberman and Alejandro Justiniano  (2015), “Job Switching and Wage Growth,” Chicago Fed Letter  337 (Chicago:  Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago), https://www.chicagofed.org/publications/chicago -fedletter/201 5/337."
 Figure 10 shows the 12month growth rate of the employment cost index for total compensation for p rivate i ndustry w orkers  (ECI).
" About two years after the onset of the financial crisis, the ECI moved up slightly in 2010 and then remained essentially flat at an annual growth rate of 2 percent over a five -year period between 2010 and 2015."
" Even so, the growth rate of the ECI did not return to the levels experienced before 2008."
"  First, the headline unemployment rate by itself can obscure important dimensions of labor market slack, so it is important to heed Dr.  Palmer’s dictum and consult a broad set of aggr egated and disaggregated measures."
"  - 15 - expansion, consistent with Augustus Hawkins’s emphasis on the importance of full employment for all Americans."
" The assessment of shortfalls from broad -based and inclusive maximum employment will be a critical guidepost for monetary policy, alongside indicators of realized and expected inflation."
  The Federal Open Market Committee has said it expects the policy rate to remain in the current target range until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee’ s assessments of maximum employ ment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time .
 It has noted that asset purchases will continue at least at the current pace until substantial further progress has been made toward the maximum -employ ment and inflation goals.
" In assessing substantial further progress, I will be looking for sustained improvements in realized and expected inflation and examining a range of indicators to assess shortfalls from maximum employment."
" I will be looking for in dicators that show the healing in the labor market is broad based, rather than focusing on the narrow  - 16 - aggregate U -3 unemployment rate, in light of the significant decline in labor force participation since the spread of COVID and the extremely elevated une mployment rate for workers in the lowest wage quartile."
" For nearly four decades, monetary policy was guided by a strong presumption that accommodation should be reduced preemptively when the unemployment rate nears its normal rate in anticipation that high  inflation would otherwise soon follow."
 But changes in economic relationships over the past decade have led trend inflation to run persistently somewhat below target and inflation to be relatively insensitive  to resource utilization.
" With these changes,  our new monetary policy framework recognizes that removing accommodation preemptively as headline unemployment reaches low levels in anticipation of inflationary pressures that may not  materialize may result in  an unwarranted loss of opportunity for many A mericans."
" It may curtail progress for racial and ethnic groups that have faced systemic challenges in the labor force, which is particularly salient in light of recent research indicating that additional labor market tightening is especially beneficial fo r these groups when it occurs in already tight labor markets, compared with earlier in the labor market cycle.33  Instead, t he shortfalls approach means that the labor market will be able  to continue to improve absent high inflationary pressures or an unmooring of inflation expectations to the  upside ."
"Inflation remains very low , and although various measures of inflation expectations have picked up recently, they remain within their recent historical ranges ."
"” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity,  Spring, pp."
" - 17 - percent on a 12month basis in a few months  when the low March and April price readings from last year fall out of the 12 -month calculation, and we could see transitory inflationary pressures refle cting imbalances if there is a surge of demand that outstrips supply in certain sectors when the economy opens back up."
" While I will  carefully monitor inflation expectations, it will be important to see a sustained improvement in actual inflation to meet our average inflation goal."
"Today the economy remains far from our goals in terms of both employment and inflation , and it will take some time  to achieve substantial further progress."
" I look forward to the time when this K -shaped recovery becomes a broadbased and inclusive recovery and when vaccinations are widespread, the services sector springs back to life, and all Americans enjoy the benefits of full employment."
 I cannot think  of a more meaningful time to be studying economics or a more important  time to be thinking about  the different ways to assess our shared goal of full employment.
