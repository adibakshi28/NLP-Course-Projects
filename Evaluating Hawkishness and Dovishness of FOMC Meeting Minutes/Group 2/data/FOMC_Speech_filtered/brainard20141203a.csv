"For release on delivery  2:00 p.m. E ST December 3 , 2014         The Fed eral Reserve ’s Financial Stability Agenda     Remarks by   Lael Brainard   Member   Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at the  Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy  The Brookings Institution  Washington, D.C.        December 3 , 2014    Although its  founding statute  makes no explicit mention of financial stability , the Federal Reserve was  created  in response to a severe financial panic, and safeguarding financial stability is deeply ingrained in the mission  and culture  of the Federal Reserve Board ."
" Recognizing the se limitations , the Federal Reserve is likely to  actively utilize  the tools under its authority , which means  placing  a strong em phasis  on structural resilience in the largest and most complex institutions , while strengthening less tested time -varying tools to lean against the buildup of risks  and, in some circumstances,  looking  to the unique capacity of monetary policy to act acros s the financial system ."
"  Second, we undertake periodic analyses of potential systemwide consequences of possible , particularly salient  shocks, such as a sharp rise in the level or volatility of interest rates, including  possible 3 According to the International Monetary Fund, only about one in three credit booms have historically ended in some form of financial crisis."
" The severely adverse scenario is anticipated to feature an unemployment rate over the first six to eight quarters of the scenario that increases between 3 percentage po ints and 5 percentage points, which is the amount by which unemployment has increased in the most recent three severe recessions."
" However, if such an increase does not raise the level of the unemployment rate to at least 10 percent-- the average level to w hich it has increased in the most recent three severe recessions --the path of the unemployment rate in most cases will be specified so as to raise the unemployment rate to at least this level."
" Under this methodology, the increase in the unemployment rate would be slightly greater if the initial unemployment rate were low --as it would be after a sustained long expansion."
" Moreover, setting a floor for the unemployment rate recognizes the fact that not only do cyclical systemic risks build up at financial in termediaries during robust expansions, but that these risks are also easily obscured by the buoyant environment."
The classic case for timevarying broad macroprudential tools is to lean against a dangerous acceleration of credit growth at a time when the degree of monetary tightening  that would be needed to slow it down would be highly inconsistent with conditions in the real economy.
"  The existing research would suggest  that indicators related to debt growth, leverage, and other signs of growing financial imbalances would provide guidance on when to implement the buffer  and when to deactivate  it."
" However, it may prove to be less effective in leaning against credit growth, s ince, as credit booms progress, there is greater potential for capit al to be relatively cheap , asset valuations to be inflated, and risk weights to be incorrect."
" Four th pillar:  Monetary p olicy  Recognition of the limits to the  macroprudential framework brings us to a consideration of monetary policy —a powerful tool with broad reach, but also relatively  blunt .10  Monetary policy is the only tool available to the Federal Reserve that has far -reaching effects  on private credit creation across the entire financial system and one of the few tools that can be changed rapidly  (although its effects have famously long and variable lags)."
" While recognizing the  farreaching  effects  of monetary policy  on financial conditions , there are good reasons to view monetary policy as the second line of defense ."

"                                                   - 13 - Nevertheless, there may  be times when standard monetary policy and financial stability considerations  conflict."
"In several recent instances,  foreign economies have faced some tensi on between high unemployment and shortfalls in inflation relative to the central bank ’s target , on the one hand, and financial stability concerns associated with rapidly rising real estate prices  on the other ."
policymakers have acknowledged the potential for monetary policy adjustments to play  a role in the pursuit of financial stability.
" T he Bank of England’s 2013 forward guidance had a specific financial stability “knockout” for monetary policy accommodation if the Financial Policy Committee ( FPC) judges that the stance of monetary policy poses a significant threat to financial stability that cannot be contained by the substantial range of mitigating policy actions available to the FPC.”11 If, in the future, the United States did face a similar dilemma, where financial imbalances are growing  rapidly  against a backdrop of subpar economic conditions, the Federal Reserve may consider  monetary policy for financial stability purposes more readily than some foreign peers because our  regulatory perimeter is narrower, the capital markets are more imp ortant , and the  macroprudential toolkit is not as extensive."
" Even in these circumstances, however, it is important to be prudent about the role of monetary policy, recognizing that the necessary adjustments in monetary policy could have broader consequenc es."
" For example, a tightening in monetary policy sufficient to limit strong 11 See Bank of England (2013), “Forward Guidance,” webpage, www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetarypolicy/Pages/forwardguidance.aspx , August 7, paragraph 5."
                                                   - 14 - credit growth could depress employment and potentially  trigger a sharp correction  in financial markets .
 But it is equally important to acknowledge the potential utility  of monetary policy for addressing  risks to financial stability and to the broad er economy  and to continue  expand ing our work  on the appropriate role of financial stability in our monetary policy framework.
" It is therefore important that we actively utilize  the tools under our authorit y—which place particular emphasis on building structural resilience at the largest, most complicated institutions  through tougher throughthe-cycle standards, along with broad countercyclical measures to limit the buildup, and potential consequences, of risks to financ ial stability , while exploring the design of time -varying sector -specific  tools, and, at times, looking to monetary policy  as a powerful tool that unlike any other operates across the entire financial system."
