"For release on delivery 10:00 a.m. EDT (8:00 a.m. MDT) August 31, 2012         Monetary Policy since the Onset of the Crisis   Remarks by  Ben S."
" Sixteen months later, with the financ ial crisis in full swing, the FOMC  had lowered the target for the federal funds rate to nearly zero, thereby en tering the unfamiliar te rritory of having to conduct monetary policy with th e policy interest rate at its effective lower bound."
Today I will review the e volution of U.S. monetary policy since late 2007.
" I’ll discuss what we have le arned about the efficacy and drawbacks of these less familiar forms of monetary policy, a nd I’ll talk about the implications for the Federal Reserve’s ongoing efforts to promote a return to maximum employment in a context of price stability."
"Monetary Policy in 2007 and 2008    When significant financial stresses firs t emerged, in August 2007, the FOMC responded quickly, first through liquidity acti ons--cutting the discount rate and extending term loans to banks--and then, in September, by lowering the target for the federal funds rate by 50 basis points.1  As further indications of economic weakness appeared over subsequent months, the Comm ittee reduced its target for the federal funds rate by a cumulative 325 basis points, leaving the targ et at 2 percent by the spring of 2008."
" When the crisis inte nsified markedly in the fall, the Committee responded by cutting the target for the federa l funds rate by 100 basis points in October, with half of this easing coming as part of an unprecedented coordinated interest rate cut by six major central banks."
 The unemployment rate in the United States rose from about 6 percent in September 2008 to n early 9 percent by Apr il 2009--it would peak at 10 percent in October--while inflation declined sharply.
 Declining yields and rising asset prices eas e overall financial c onditions and stimulate economic activity through channels similar to  those for conventiona l monetary policy.
" For instance, they can signal that the central bank intends to pursue a persistently more  accommodative policy stance than previously thought, thereby lowering investor s’ expectations for the future path of the federal funds rate and putting additional downward pressure on longterm interest rates, particularly in real terms."
"- 6 -    About a year ago, the FOMC introduced  a variation on its earlier purchase programs, known as the maturity extension program (MEP), under which the Federal Reserve would purchase $400 billion of longterm Treasury securi ties and sell an equivalent amount of shorterterm Treasury securities over the period ending in June 2012.10  The FOMC subsequently extended the MEP through the end of this year.11  By reducing the average maturity of the s ecurities held by the public, the MEP puts additional downward pressure on longerterm interest rates and further eases overall financial conditions."
 Mode l simulations conducted at the Federal                                                                                                                                                                                    arbitrage model of the term structure of interest rates and timeseries data from 1994 to 2007 to estimate the effects on term premiums of changes in the amount of longerterm Treasury debt and agency MBS held by the public.
" Using this model, Li and Wei are able to  infer the effects of the two LSAP programs and the MEP, controlling for changes in the expected path of the federal funds rate and its implications for longterm interest rates."
 Early skeptics of balance sheet policies worried that any ef fects on Treasury yields would not be transmitted to other interest rates and asset prices.
" For example, a study using the Board’s FRB/US model of the economy found that, as of 2012, the first two rou nds of LSAPs may have raised the level of output by almost 3 percent and increased private payroll employment by more than 2 million jobs, relative to what otherwise would have occurred.15  The Bank of England has used LSAPs in a manner similar to that of the Federal Reserve, so it is of interest that researchers have found the financial and m acroeconomic effects of the British programs to be qualitatively similar to those in the United States.16 To be sure, these estimates of the macroeconomic effects of LSAPs should be treated with caution."
" It is lik ely that the crisis and the re cession have attenuated some of the normal transmission channels of monetary policy relative to what is assumed in the models; for example, restrictive mortgage  underwriting standards have reduced the effects of lower mortgage rates."
 Those estimates suggest a peak effect of 11/2 to 2 percent for real output and between 3/4 and 11/2 percent for inflation in the United Kingdom.
" In part icular, forward guidance that lowers privatesector expecta tions regarding future shortte rm rates should cause longerterm interest rates to decline, leadi ng to more accommodative financial conditions.18    The Federal Reserve has made considerab le use of forward guidance as a policy tool.19  From March 2009 through June 2011, the FOMC’s postmeeting statement noted that economic conditions “are likely to warrant  exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period.”20  At the August 2011 meeting, the Committee made its guidance more precise by st ating that economic conditions  would likely warrant that the federal funds rate remain excep tionally low “at least through mid2013.”21  At the beginning of this year, the FOMC extended the anticipated period of exceptionally low rates further, to “at least through late 2014,” guidance that has been reaffirmed at subsequent meetings.22  As the language indicates, this  guidance is not an unconditional promise; rather, it is a statement about the FOMC’s collective judgment regarding the                                                             18 See Eggertsson and Woodford (2003) and Levin and others (2010) for discussions of the role of communication at the zero lower bound."
" The Bank of Canada, for example, announced in April 2009 its intention to hold the overnight policy at 25 basis points through the second quarter of 2010; this conditional guidance was subject to the bank’s assessment of future inflation trends."
"  The views of Committee members regardi ng the likely timing of policy firming represent a balance of many factors, but the current forward guidance is broadly consistent with prescriptions coming from a range of standard benchmarks, including simple policy rules and optimal control methods.23  Some of the policy rules informing the forward guidance relate policy interest rate s to familiar determinants, such as inflation and the output gap."
"24 On responding to unusual headwind s (technically, a situation in which a lower real interest rate is required to achieve full employment), see Williams (2009)."
" For example, since 2009, forecasters participating in the Blue Chip survey have repeatedly marked down their projections of the unemployment rate they expect to prevail at the time that the FOMC begins to lift the target for the federal funds rate away from zero."
" Thus, the Committee’s forward guidance may have conveyed a greater willingness to maintain accommodation than private forecasters had previously believed.25  The behavior of financial market prices in periods around changes in the forward guidance is  also consistent with  the view that the guidance has affected policy expectations.26 Making Policy with Nontraditional Tools:  A CostBenefit Framework   Making monetary policy with nontraditional tools is challenging."
" In light                                                             25 In October 2009, private forecasters in the Blue Chip  survey projected that the unemployment rate would be near 10 percent and overall inflation as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) would be 2 percent at the time that shortterm interest rates (threemonth Treasury bill rates) rose above 50 basis points."
" By March 2011, forecasters had lowered the projected unemployment rate at  the policy liftoff date to about 81/2 percent, again accompanied by inflation near 2 percent."
" And by March 2012, forecasters projected that the unemployment rate would have fallen below 71/2 percent, and that CPI inflation would be moving up to close to 21/2 percent, before shortterm intere st rates would rise appreciab ly above the current target range."
" As the global financial system depends on d eep and liquid markets for U.S. Treasury securities, significant impairme nt of those markets would be  costly, and, in particular, could impede the transmission of monetary policy."
" Even if - 13 -    unjustified, such a reduction in confidence might increase the risk of a costly unanchoring of inflation expectations, lead ing in turn to financial and economic instability."
" It is noteworthy, however, that the e xpansion of the balance sheet to date has not materially affected inflation expectations, likely in pa rt because of the great emphasis the Federal Reserve has placed on developing tools to ensu re that we can normalize monetary policy when appropriate, even if our securities holdings remain larg e."
" In particular, the FOMC will be able to put upward pressure on shortte rm interest rates by raising the interest rate it pays banks for reserves they hold at the Fed."
  A fourth potential cost of balance sheet pol icies is the possibility that the Federal Reserve could incur financial lo sses should interest rates rise  to an unexpected extent.
" Extensive analyses suggest that, from a purely fi scal perspective, the odds are strong that the Fed’s asset purchases will make money for the taxpayers, reducing the federal deficit and debt.27  And, of course, to the extent that  monetary policy helps strengthen the economy and raise incomes, the benefits for the U.S. fiscal position would be substantial."
" As of July, the unemployment rate had fallen to 8.3 percent from its cyclical peak of 10 percent and payr olls had risen by 4 million jobs from their low point."
" And despite periodic concerns about deflation risks, on the one hand, and repeated warnings that excessive policy  accommodation would ignite inflation, on the other hand, inflation (except for temporary deviations caused primarily by swings in commodity prices) has remained near the Co mmittee’s 2 percent objective and inflation expectations have remained stable."
" The unemployment rate remains mo re than 2 percentage  points above what most FOMC participants see as  its longerrun normal value, and other indicators--such as the labor force participation rate and th e number of people working part time for economic reasons--confirm that labor force utilization remains at very low levels."
" I have noted on other occasions that the declines in unemployment we have seen would likely continue only if economic growth picked up to a rate above its longerterm trend.28  In fact, growth in recent quarte rs has been tepid, and so, not surprisingly, we have seen no net improvement in the unemployment rate si nce January."
"- 16 -    grow more quickly than it has recently, the unemployment rate is likely to remain far above levels consistent with ma ximum employment for some time."
" In light of the policy actions the FOMC  has taken to date, as well as the economy’s natural recovery mechanisms, we might have hoped for greater progress by now in returning to maximum employment."
" Some have taken the lack of progress as evidence that the financial crisis caused stru ctural damage to the economy, rendering the current levels of unemployment impervious  to additional monetary accommodation."
" The literature on this issue is extensive,  and I cannot fully review it today.29  However, following every previous U.S. recession sin ce World War II, the unemployment rate has returned close to its prerecession level,  and, although the recent recession was unusually deep, I see little evidence of substantial structural change in recent years."
"Rather than attributing the slow recovery to longerter m structural factors, I see growth being held back curre ntly by a number of headwinds."
" Second, fiscal policy, at both the federal a nd state and local levels, has become an important headwind for the pace of economic growth."
" Notwithstanding some recent improvement in tax revenues, state and local governments still face tight budget situations and continue to cu t real spending and employment ."
" Earlier in the recovery, limited credit availa bility was an importan t factor holding back growth, and tight borrowing conditions fo r some potential homebuyers and small businesses remain a problem today."
"Conclusion  Early in my tenure as a member of the Bo ard of Governors, I gave a speech that considered options for monetary policy when th e shortterm policy interest rate is close to its effective lower bound.31  I was reacting to common assertions at the time that monetary policymakers would be “out of a mmunition” as the federal funds rate came closer to zero."
" Estimates of the effects of nontraditional policies on economic ac tivity and inflation are uncertain, and the use of nontraditional policies involves cost s beyond those generally associated with morestandard policies."
" In a ddition, in the present context, nontraditional policies share the limitations of monetary po licy more generally:  Monetary policy cannot achieve by itself what a broader and more  balanced set of economic policies might achieve; in particular, it cannot neutralize the fiscal and financial risks that the country faces."
" The stagnation of the labor market in particular  is a grave concern not only because of the enormous suffering and waste of human talent it entails, but also because persistently high levels of unemployment will wreak structural damage on our economy that could last for many years."
"  Over the past five years, the Federa l Reserve has acted to support economic growth and foster job creation, and it is important to achieve further progress, particularly in the labor market."
