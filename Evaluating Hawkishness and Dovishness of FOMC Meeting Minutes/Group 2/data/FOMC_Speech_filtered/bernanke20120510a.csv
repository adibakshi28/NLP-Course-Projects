" The hypothetical supervisory stress scenario used in the CCAR was quite severe ; it included a peak   - 2 - unemployment rate of 13 percent, a 50  percent drop in equity prices, and a 21 percent further decline in housing prices , as well as steep falls in prices of  financial assets most exposed to conditions in Europe ."
" In addition to strength ened regulatory and supervisory requirements,  banks face market demands that they operate with  more resilient business models."
"  In many contexts, counterparties are demanding greater security  in the form of more  and better -quality collateral or higher margins."

" The SLOOS also indicates that demand for many types of loans has continued to  increase , with  demand for C&I loans ha ving risen to relatively high levels."

"  Auto lending also has reportedly been solid, reflecting strong  fundamentals in auto markets --such as robust  demand for use d cars and relatively low delinquency rates on existing auto loans ."

"  The Fe deral Reserve is keenly interested in understanding how shifts in loan supply , loan demand , and borrower quality  may be affecting lending and , by extension , the broader economy."
" Of course, sorting out the relative effect of changes in loan demand from the effect of changes in loan supply can be quite difficult  because they can be influenced by the same factors ."
" As the  recovery  gains  greater  traction,  increasing both the demand for credit and the creditworthiness of potential borrowers, a    - 12 - financially stronger banking system will be well positioned to expand its lending."
