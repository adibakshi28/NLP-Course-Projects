"   Remarks by   Lael Brainard   Member   Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at  “2016 Monetary Policy Forum ”  An annual  conference sponsored by  University of Chicago Booth School of Business   New York, New York         February 26, 2016    Beginning  in 2014, we saw  confident predictions  of a coming strong  divergence in monetary policy among the major economies."
Such limits might reflect common forces buffeting economies  around the world or  the powerful transmission of shocks across borders through exchange rate and other financial channels that may have the effect of  front -running monetary policy adjustments  in the vicinity of the zero lower bound.
monetary policy would chart a notably  divergent path have been tempered  by powerful crosscurrents from abroad .1  How Different  Are Underlying Conditions?
" The U.S. unemployment rate is now under 5 percent, compared with 10 percent at its recent peak."
" 2 The employment -topopulation ratio for prime -age individuals, for example, is nearly 2 percentage points below its 200407 average, while part -time work remains elevated and progress on wages has been slow."
"  - 2 - experienced a rapid drop in unemployment to 5.1 percent, as low as  precrisis levels, and labor force participation has remained relatively strong."
" In contrast, unemployment in the euro area was 10 -1/2 percent in the fourth quarter, down just 13/4 percentage points from its recent peak and still well above pre -crisis levels."
" Accordingly , market participants have expect ed policy in the United States and the U nited K ingdom  to become less accommodative, while  remain ing very accommodative over the medium term in the euro area .3 In Japan, expectations of monetary policy divergence have reflected Japan’s  long period of disappointments  on its inflation target to a greater extent  than its remaining resource gap ."
" Japan’ s unemployment rate is 3.3  percent, already below the previous cyclical trough, and the I nternational M onetary Fund estimates the output gap  to have been the same in Japan and the United States  in 2015 at 11/2 perc ent."
" However, with inflation in Japan previously having been near zero for an extended period and inflation expectations under pressure, the Bank of Japan’s commitment to increasing inflation expectations and moving inflation up to its 2 percent target ha s led market participants to expect extremely accommodative monetary policy to persist for quite a while ."
"  Currently , however, there are smaller differences among the major economies on measures of realized and expected inflation than there are on resourc e utilization."
" In 2015, t he 12month change in total  personal consumption expenditure s (PCE) inflation in the U nited S tates was 0.6 percent, while  headline inflation in the U nited K ingdom, e uro area, and Japan we re 0.2 percent."
 All inflation rates are well below target.
"24 of the February 2016 Monetary Policy Report  (Board of Governors, 2016)."
"   - 3 - the extent that the downward pressure on global inflation is due  to falling oil prices, this pressure  would be expected  to abate if oil prices stabilize."
"  But even after removing energy prices, core PCE inflatio n has come in consistently under the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target here in the United States and does not look very different from inflation in economies that are expected to maintain accommodative monetary policy for some time."
" Core PCE inflation, or inflation excluding food and energy prices, has remained stubbornly in the vicinity of 11/4 to 11/2 percent over the past three  years in the United States, similar to the United Kingdom and not very different from the roughly 1 percent core inflation i n the e uro area and Japan."
 We also see notable  similarities in the recent deterioration in market measures of inflation expectations.
" While in the e uro a rea, swaps -based inflation compensation has fallen about 3/4 percentage point since the middle of 2014 and is now around 11/2 percent at the five -year, fiveyear-ahead horizon, in the U nited S tates,  swaps -based inflation compensation has fallen 1 full percentage point over the same period and is now at 13/4 percent."
" With realized and expected  future  inflation not showing large differences , the expectation of monetary policy divergence between the United S tates, on the one hand, and the United Kingdom and the  euro area, on the other , must rest to a large extent on remaining differences in resource utilization and expectations that inflation outcomes will diverge as a result of these differences ."
" However, it is important to note that the extent of inflation divergence generated by differences in resource utilization across countries is  - 4 - likely much smaller now than it has been in earlier decades ."
" Recent research suggests a dramatic flattening of the Phillips curve in recent decades.4  If this finding continues to hold true , resource utilization would need to differ more sharply across national economies to produce a noticeable difference in inflation."
" The persistence of relatively soft core PCE  inflation readings  in the U nited States , despite a substantial improvement in employment, suggests we should be cautious in relying on the historical relationship between employment gains and stronger inflation in today’s economy."
" Moreover, t he softening in market -based measures of inflation expectations and some hints of weakening in survey measures deserve our attention."
 This  deterioration in inflation expectations  and a weake ned link between labor market tightening and inflation --together with the asymmetry of policy in the vicinity of the lower bound--lead me to put a high premium on evidence that actual inflation is firming  sustainably .
" Putting these pieces of evidence together suggests that if  core inflation remains below target in all major advanced economies and inflation expectations remain under pressure in m any, I might expect policy divergence to  remain  more  limited  than previously p redicted ."
"Common Conditions  To the extent that we are observing limited divergence in inflation outcomes and less divergence in realized policy paths than many anticipated, this could be attributable to common shocks  or trends that cause economic conditions to be synchronized across                                                  4 In the United States, for example, Blanchard (2016) estimates that the slope of the Phillips curve has declined by more than two -thirds since the 1970s ."
" The sharp repeated declines in the price of oil  have been a major common factor depressing headline inflation  and are also  likely feeding into low core inflation, although to a lesser extent.5  As noted previously , these price declines have led headline inflation across the globe to behave quite similarly over this time period."
" Even so, most observers expect this s ource of convergence in inflationary outcomes to eventually fade and there after not affect monetary policy paths over the medium term."
" The neutral rate of interest --or the rate of interest consistent with the economy remaining at its potential rate of output and inflation remaining at target level --appears to have declined over the past 30 years in the U nited States and is now at hist orically low levels.6  Similarly, longer -run interest rates appear also to have fallen across a broad group of advanced and emerging market economies, suggesting that neutral rates are at historically low levels in many countries around the world and near or below zero in the major advanced foreign economies.7  Although the reasons for the declines in neutral rates are not perfectly understood and may differ across countries, there are some common drivers, such as slower productivity and labor force growth and a heightened sensitivity to risk.8                                                    5 In five of the six quarters since mid -2014, the price of oil has dec reased for a cumulative decline of 70 percent."
"8 While the empirical link between potential growth and the neutral rate is not precisely estimated, the evidence suggests that slower trend growth is associated with lower interest rates ; see Laubach and Williams (2015) and Hamilton and others  (2015)."
 U.S. labor force growth has slowed from 1 percent from 2001 to 2004 to 1/2 percent over the most recent 4 years.
" Over the same periods, e uroarea growth has slowed from 1.3 percent to 0.4 percent."
" Productivity growth over the same periods has slowed from 3.0  percent to 0.5 percent in the U nited States, from 0.6 percent to 0.2 percent in the e uro area, and 1.5 percent to 0.5 percent in Japan."
"The global economy is also experiencing a downshift in emerging market growth momentum led by China, which may prove somewhat persistent."
" Wher eas earlier in the recovery there was a striking divergence between the relatively buoyant growth in major emerging economies and depressed growth in advanced economies, lately the extent of divergence has diminished noticeably.9  China is undergo ing a challenging se t of economic transitions ."
" Trend growth has slowed substantially and is expected to slow further, and the composition of growth is shifting away from resource -intensive manufacturing and exports toward a greater share for consumption and servic es."
" Commodity e xporters and close trading partners in Asia will be most affected, but the  changes  in the composition and rate of growth in a country that has accounted for about one -third  of the growth in world   output and trade will likely ripple through the global economy much more generally."
"  9 From the end of 2009 to the end of 2013, growth in important U.S. emerging market trading partners averaged 4.7 percent, while growth in advanced economies averaged 1.8 percent."
" However, in 2014 emerging country growth slowed to 3.3 percent, compared with  1.6 percent in advanced economies, and for the fir st three quarters of 2015 , annualized growth was  2.5 percent and 1.1 percent, respectively ."
" By one rough estimate , accounting for the net effect of exchange rate appreciation  and changes  in equity valuations and long term yields,  over the past year and a half, the United States has experienced a tightening of  financial conditions tha t is the equivalent of an additional increase of over 75 basis point s in the federal funds rate.10   The transmission of divergent economic conditions across borders typically occurs though a couple of different channels."
" First, a decline in demand in one country reduces its demand for imports from other countries."
" Second, the fall in economic activity would be expected to trigger a more accommodative monetary policy, which helps offset the effect of the shock by  both supporting domestic demand and weakeni ng the exchange rate."
 The weaker exchange rate in turn leads domestic consumers to switch their expenditures away from more expensive foreign imports to cheaper domestic products  while increasing the competitiveness of exports .
" The extent to which monetary policy offsets the shock by dispersing it to trade partners as opposed to strengthening                                                  10 These estimates are based on rough rules of thumb regarding the effects  on output  of changes in longterm interest rates, equity prices, the exchange rate, and the federal funds rate from the FRB/US model  and assume a highly persistent change in the federal funds rate ."
   - 8 - domestic demand depends on the responsiveness of domestic demand relative to the exchange rate.
"  The exchange rate channel, by raising the price of imports in domestic currency, also pushes up domestic inflation and exerts downward pressure on foreign inflation."
" The recent experience of Sweden suggests that for highly open economies, the effect  of foreign shocks  can be extremely powerful.11  Sweden’s economic growth has been relatively rapid recently, reaching nearly 4 percent over the most recent four quarters."
" Moreover, the employment gap is estimated to be nearly closed, and there are signs of financial excess in the housing market."
" In ordinary times , these conditions would be consistent with relatively tight monetary policy."
" However, inflation has run persistently well below the central bank’s 2 percent inflation target."
" Given the relative openness of Sweden’s economy, moving the inflation rate back up to target has been greatly complicated by the sensitivi ty of Sweden’s exchange rate and financial conditions to developments in the e uro a rea, where domestic economic conditions are consistent with much more  accommodative policy."
" As a result, the Riksbank has been pursuing extremely accommodative monetary pol icy, most recently lowering th e interest rate on deposits to minus  0.5 percent and authorizing the Governor and Deputy Governor  to intervene in foreign currency markets."
" Since the middle of 2014, with a reassessment of demand growth in the euro area and subsequently in emerging markets and other commodity exporters, the real trade -weighted value of the dollar has increased nearly  20 percent."
" As a result, in 2014 and 2015, net ex ports subtracted a little over 1/2  percentage point from GDP growth each year , and econometric models point to a subtraction of a further 1 percentage point this year.12  In addition, the dollar’s appreciation is estimated to have put significant downward pressure on inflation:  N onoil import prices fell 31/2 percent in 2015, subtracting an estimated 1/2 percentage point from core PCE inflation.13   Financial channels can powerfully propagat e negative  shocks in one market by catalyzing a broader  reassessment of risks and increases in risk spreads across many financial markets."
" Since the beginning of the year , U.S. financial markets have reacted strongly to adverse news on emerging market growth, even though the news on the U.S. labor market has remained positive."
" In this regard, although China’s direct imports from the U nited S tates are modest, uncertainty about changes to its  exchange rate system  and financial imbalances , together with changes in the composition of its growth, have had broader global spillovers that may pose risks to the U.S. outlook."
  Recent events suggest the transmis sion of foreign shocks  can take place extremely quickly such that  financial markets anticipate and indeed may thereby  front -run the expected monetary policy reaction s to these developments .
 It also appears that the exchange rate channel may have play ed a particularly important role recently in transmitting economic and financial development s across national borders.
"8 -9 of the February 2016 Monetary Policy Report  (Board of Governors, 2016) ."
" - 10 - recent research suggests that financial transmission is likely to be amplified in economies with near -zero interest rates, such that anticipated monetary policy adjustments in one economy may contribute more to a shifting of demand across borders than a boost to overall demand.14  This  finding  could explain why the sensitivity of exchange rate movements to economic news and to changes  in foreign monetary policy appear to have been relatively elevated recently."
" Under certain conditions --such as flexible exchange rates, deep and well -regulated financial markets, and flexible product and labor markets --policies designed for the domestic economy can readily offset any spillovers from economic conditions abroad, and policies designed to address domestic conditions can achieve desirable outcom es both within the national economy and more broadly.15   In some circumstances,  howeve r, cooperation can be quite helpful."
" With intensified transmission effects in the vicinity of the zero lower bound, there is a risk that uncoordinated policy on its own could have the effect of shifting demand across borders rather than addressing the underlying weakness in global demand."
 This might be a good time for policymakers to reaffirm their commitment to work toward the common goal of strengthening global demand.
" Similarly, w ith anemic global  demand and interest rates near zero, in some economies there is scope for monetary policy to  be more effective w ith fiscal policy working in the same direction."
"With potential growth and nominal borrowing rates both low, public  investment that increases p otential in the longer  run and demand in the shorter run could make an important contribution."
 A  joint determination  by policymakers  across major economies  to better deploy  polic y tool s to provide  support for global demand could be beneficial .
