" In the case of the Federal Reserve, our responsibilities include ensuring that banks are well supervised and regu lated, working with other government agencies through the Financial Stability Oversight Council to promote financial stability, and , of course , conducting a U.S. monetary policy that aims to achieve our dual -mandate goals of maximum employment and price st ability."
" As the title of my talk suggests, my remarks today will focus on the importance of some specific global financial linkages that are relevant to the execution and communication of U.S. monetary policy aimed at achieving our domestic mandates."
" First, yield curves for nominal and inflation -indexed bonds provide usef ul—if also noisy —information about the expected future path of the policy rate, inflation, the business cycle, and the term premium required to hold sovereign bonds."
" Second, yields on longmaturity bonds represent , generally , a key channel in the transmis sion of monetary policy to the real economy and, specifically, are a fundamental building block markets use to discount cash flows relevant for valuing financial assets."
" First, this correlation will be  - 4 - present  if the underlying macro fundamentals —for example, productivity growth, saving–investment imbalances, and longer -term inflation expectations —that drive the factors are correlated across countries.2  Second, as is emphasized in Clarida (2019c ) and Obstfeld (2020), this correlation will also be present  if countries are tightly financially integrated even if fundamentals themselves a re independent across countries.3  Interpreting the Global Level  Factor  From any set of level and slope factors extracted across a collection of sovereign yield curves, one can in turn extract a global level factor and a global slope factor that account for the correlation among the countryspecific level and slope factors.4  As can be seen in figure 1, the global level factor (the bl ue line) accounts for most of the evident downward trend and much of the variation relative to that trend in the estimated U.S., U.K., and German level factors."
" Plausibly, the global level factor embedded in these three sovereign yield curves reflects the contribution of possibly several global macro fundamental drivers —includi ng global productivity growth, the balance between global saving and investment, and longer -term inflation expectations —and likely also other “market” or “technical” factors specific to the trading of these sovereigns in the global bond market."
" As can be seen in f igure 2, however, most of the trend and variation in the global level factor about this trend can be accounted for by the evolution of estimates of the  2 For instance, Clarida (2019b) discusses the role of falling neutral real rates and longer -term inflation expectations worldwide in the decline in global sovereign bond yields."
 3 See Ferreira and Shousha (2021) for a rigorous econometric study of the fundamental determinants of real interest rates in global general equilibrium.
"   - 5 - neutral real interest rates in these countries.5  Figure 2 plots the global level fac tor against a simple average of the Holston, Laubach, and Williams ( 2017, henceforth HLW) time -series estimates of r* —the neutral real interest rate consistent with trend growth and stable inflation —for the U nited S tates, the U nited K ingdom , and Germany."
" And because central banks, including the Federal Reserve, typically  channel Milton Friedman (1968) and believe that the evolution of r* primarily reflects nonmonetary factors that are beyond the central bank’s control , an “r* theory” of the level factor —if true —has important implications for how central banks extract signal from noise from sovereign yield curves as well as for how they calibrate the stance of monetary policy consistent with a credible inflation target."
"  Under this interpretation, and as was anticipated years ago by Greenspan  (2005), Bernanke (2005), Clarida (2005) , and others, credible inflation -targeting central banks operating in an integrated global capital market—at least when they are operating away from their effective lower bound ( ELB )—are primarily in the yield curve “slope” business, but much less so in the yield curve “level” business.6   Figure 3 shows the relationship between the yield on a 10year Treasury note and an estimate of the neutra l nominal U.S. policy rate, which I set equal to the HLW  5 Recent work by Bauer and Rudebusch (2020) highlights the role of movements in neutral real interest rates in the dynamics of the yield curve."
" 6 Interestingly, it was the success of credible inflation targeting, in addition to financial globalization, that has put central banks in the “slope” business."
" In a world in which inflation expectations are not well anchored, monetary policy  can have a major effect on the level of interest rates by shifting, for  better or worse, long erterm inflation expectations, as was the case in the U nited States from the 1960s through the early 1990s (Clarida, Gal í, and Gertler,  2000)."
"  - 6 - estimate of r* for the U nited S tates plus a 2  percent  inflation objective, a proxy for the neutral nominal interest rate when long erterm inflation expectations are anchored at the 2 percent  target."
" As is evident from the figure and as can be verified econometrically, there has been since at least the 1990s a stable, mean -reverting dynamic relationship  between the benchmark nominal Treasury yield and a neutral nominal interest rate proxy derived from the HLW time -series estimates for r* in the U nited S tates."
 Interpreting the Slope  Factor  I would now like to illustrate what I mean when I say that the slope of the yield curve is an important channel through which monetary policy is transmitted.
" See also the appendix for a simple model linking the neutral nominal interest rate, the yield curve, the policy rate spread, and the term premium."
" For example,  the Ferreira and Sousha (2021) specification for r* includes six explanatory variables, one of which is a trade -weighted index of global productivity and demogr aphic trends."
" There is a vast literature (Claessen s, Stracca, and W arnock, 2016, provide an overview) that documents the existence of spillovers from U.S. monetary policy, especially to emerging market (EM)  financial conditions, although the recent paper by Hoek, Kamin, and Yoldas  (2020) suggests that the degree of those spillovers depe nds importantly on the source of the shock that triggers changes in Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC)  policy."
" In particular, as summarized in f igure 5.1, they identified FOMC actions associated with “growth news” as those that were immediately followed  by changes in the 10year Treasury yield and the S&P 500 index in the same direction, whereas actions associated with “monetary news” elicited changes in yields and equity prices  in opposite directions."
" Their key finding, illustrated in figure 5.2, was t hat FOMC policy rate surprises attributed to stronger U.S. growth generally have only mode rate spillovers to EM financial conditions, whereas FOMC policy rate surprises attributed to U.S. inflationary pressures trigger more substantial spillovers to EM fin ancial conditions ."
" For instance, Curcuru, De Pooter, and Eckerd (2018) examined 12 years of monetary policy announcements by the FOMC and the European Central Bank ( ECB) —a combined total of 266 monetary policy communications —focusing on how sovereign yields in one jurisdiction responded to monetary policy announcements made in the other."
" But , as is shown in the right panel, the  10 For example, Ferreira and Sousha (2021) attribute 85 basis points of the decline in U.S. neutral real interest rates since 2000 to global spillovers."
" Moreover, in their model, foreign central bank purchases of U.S. Treasury securities are a significan t contributor to fluctuations in the supply of safe assets, which in turn empirically account for much of the variation in global real interest rates in their model."
"  11 Also note from figure 6 that in the weeks before and after the Brexit vote, the 10 -year Treasury yield and the dollar –pound exchange rate were rising a nd falling together as the market assessed the likelihood of a Brexit vote (before) and the implications of a Brexit vote (after)."
"    - 10 - authors found that the spillover effect from ECB policy announcements to U.S. yields is roughly as large as that from the FOMC announcements to b und yields.12  In another influential study using a very different identification methodology, Ehrmann, Fratzscher, and Rigobon (2011) estimated significant and approximately equal spillovers from U.S. bond market shocks to EU bond markets, and from EU bond market shocks to the U.S. Treasury market.13  They attributed their findings to significant incipient and anticipated portfolio allocation flows across the two jurisdictions that respond elastically to expected rate -ofreturn differentials.14  Concluding Remarks To sum up, I believe that in extracting signal from noise from the Treasury yield curve, it is essential to incorporate the fact that observed yields in the U nited S tates and other major sovereign markets are determined in a global general equilibrium that is reflected, at least in part, in the global level of neutral policy rates and the state of long erterm global inflation expectations.15  Conditional on neutral policy rates and longer -term inflation expectations, the Federal Reserve and other major central banks can be thought of as calibrating and conducting the transmission of policy—be it through rates, forward  12 The finding of twoway causality suggests that major central banks (not just the Federal Reserve) still retain a fair amount of “monetary autonomy,” as discussed recently by Panetta (2021)."
" 15 Of course , there are very likely other fundamentals —such  as equilibrium term premi ums required to hold longduration sovereign bonds and, in many countries, default and illiquidity premium s required to hold riskier sovereign debt —that are embedded in yield curve level and slope factors in addition to neutral policy rates and long erterm inflation expectations."
"    16 The focus of these remarks has been on sovereign bond markets and monet ary policy, but monetary policy is , of course , also transmitted through the foreign exchange market."

" - 15 - Appendix  We derive in this appendix a simple model that can be used to interpret the empirical relationship between Treasury yields, the neutral real interest rate, and the policy rate spread."
" Begin with the identity that the policy rate spread equals the difference between the neutral interest rate (𝑟𝑟𝑡𝑡∗+𝜋𝜋∗) and the current policy rate :   𝑠𝑠𝑡𝑡=𝑟𝑟𝑡𝑡∗+𝜋𝜋∗−𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡,1."
" Consider a simple data -generating process  consistent with L aubach and Williams (2003) for the neutral real interest rate   𝑟𝑟𝑡𝑡∗= 𝑟𝑟𝑡𝑡−1∗+𝑤𝑤𝑡𝑡  and a simple firstorder au toregression  for the policy rate spread   𝑠𝑠𝑡𝑡= 𝜌𝜌 𝑠𝑠𝑡𝑡−1+𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡,  where 𝑤𝑤 𝑡𝑡 and 𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡 are assumed to be some unforecastable disturbances."
" The difference  between the long rates  𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡,𝑛𝑛 and the neutral interest rate (𝑟𝑟𝑡𝑡∗+ 𝜋𝜋∗) is a linear function of the policy rate spread with a  loading that depends on the dynamics of the policy rate spread as well as the covariance between the spread and the term premium."
