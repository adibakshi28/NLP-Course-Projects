"For release on delivery 8:00 p.m. EDT  June 6, 2012         Perspectives on Monetary Policy    Remarks by  Janet L."
" Before continuing, let me emphasize that  my remarks reflect my own views and not necessarily those of others in the Federal Reserve System.1 Economic Conditions and the Outlook In my remarks tonight, I will describe my perspective on monetary policy."
" The unemployment rate is almost  1 percentage point lo wer than it was a year ago, but we are still far from full employment."
"  Looking ahead, I anticipate that significant headwinds will continue to restrain the pace of the recovery so that the remaining employment                                                             1 I appreciate assistance from members of  the Board’s staff--Jon Faust, Thomas Laubach, Andrew Levin, and David Reifschneider--who contributed to th e preparation of these remarks."
" At the same  time, inflation (abstracting from the transitory effects of movements in oil prices ) has been running near 2 percen t over the past two years, and I expect it to remain at or below the Federal Open Market Committee’s (the FOMC’s) 2 percent objective for the foreseeable future."
" As always, considerable uncertainty  attends the outlook for both growth and inflation; events could prove eith er more positive or negative than what I see as the most likely outcome."
 The deceleration of payroll employment from the first to the second quarter was probably exacerbated by some co mbination of seasonal adjustment difficulties and an unusually mild wi nter that likely booste d employment growth earlier in the year.
" Smoothing through these fluc tuations, the average pace of job creation for the year to date, as well as recent unemployment benefit claims data and other indicators, appear to be consistent with an economy expanding at only a moderate rate, close to its potential."
"Such modest growth would imply little additi onal progress in the near  term in improving labor market conditions, which remain very w eak."
" Currently, the unemployment rate stands around 3 percentage points above wh ere it was at the onset of the recession--a figure that is stark enough as it is, but does not even take account of the millions more who have left the labor force or who would have joined under more normal circum stances in the past four years."
" All told, only about half of the collapse in privat e payroll employment in 2008 and 2009 has been - 3 -  reversed."
 A critical question for monetary policy is the extent to which these numbers reflect a shortfall from full employment versus a rise in  structural unemployment.
" While the magnitude of structural unemployment is un certain, I read the evidence as suggesting that the bulk of the rise during the recession was cycl ical, not structur al in nature."
" The black solid line is the unemployment gap, defined as the di fference between the actual unemployment rate and the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estima te of the rate consistent with inflation remaining stable over time."
" Other evidence also points to the dominant role of cyclical forces in the recent rise in unemplo yment:  job losses have been widespread, rather than being concentrated in the construction and financial sectors, and the comovement of job vacancies and unemployment over the past few years does not appear to be unusual.2   As I mentioned, I expect several factors to restrain the pace of the recovery and the corresponding improvement in the labor market  going forward."
"Yellen (2012), “The Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy,” speech delivered at the Money Marketeers of New York University, New York, April 11, www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/yellen20120411a.htm."
" Housi ng has typically been a driver of economic recoveries, and we have seen some modest im provement recently, but continued uncertainties over the direction of house prices, and very restricted mortgage credit availability for all but the most creditworthy buyers, will likely weigh on hous ing demand for some time to come."
" When housing demand does pick up more noticeably, the huge overhang of both unoccupied dwellings and homes in the foreclosure pipeline will likely allow a good deal of that demand to be met for a time without a sizeable expansion in homebuild ing."
" At the federa l level, stimulusrelated policies are scheduled to wind down, while both defense and nondefense purchases  are expected to decline in inflationadjusted terms over the next several years."
A third factor weighing on the outlook is the likely sluggish pace of economic growth abroad.
" Even without a further intensif ication of stresses, the slowdown in economic activity in Europe will li kely hold back U.S. export growth."
" Moreover, - 5 -  the perceived risks surrounding the European situation are already having a meaningful effect on financial conditions here in the United States, further weighing on the prospects for U.S. growth."
" Figur e 2 shows the unemployment rate together with the median forecast from last mo nth’s Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF), the dashed blue line.3  The figure also shows the cent ral tendency of the unemployment projections that my FOMC colleagues and I made at our April meeting: T hose projections reflect our assessments of the economic outlook give n our own individual judgments about the appropriate path of monetary po licy."
" Included in the figure as well is the central tendency of FOMC participants’ estimates of the longerr un normal unemployment rate, which ranges from 5.2 percent to 6 percent."
" Like private for ecasters, most FOMC part icipants expect the unemployment rate to remain well above its longerrun normal value over the next several years."
"  Of course, considerable uncertainty attends this outlook:  The shad ed area provides an estimate of the 70 percent confidence interval for the future path of the unemployment rate based on historical experience and model simulations.4  Its width suggests that  these projections could be quite far off, in either direction."
"- 6 -  Turning to inflation, figure 3 summarize s private and FOMC forecasts."
" Overall consumer price inflation has fluctuated quite a b it in recent years, largely reflecting movements in prices for oil and other commodities."
" Smoothing through th ese fluctuations, inflation as measured by the price index for personal cons umption expenditures (PCE) averaged near 2 percent over the past two years."
" In recent w eeks, however, oil and ga soline prices have moderated and are now showing through to the headlin e inflation figures."
" Looking ahead, most FOMC participants at the time of our April meeti ng expected inflation to be at, or a bit below, our longrun objective of 2 percent through 2014; private forecasters on average also expect inflation to be close to 2 per cent."
" As with unemployment, uncertainty around the inflation projection is substantial."
"In the view of some observers, the stability of inflation in the fa ce of high unemployment in recent years constitutes evidence that much of the remaining unemployment is structural and not cyclical."
" They reason that if there were tr uly substantial slack in the labor market, simple accelerationist “Phillips curve” models would predict more noticeable downward pressure on inflation."
" However, substantial crosscountry  evidence suggests that, in lowinflation environments, inflation is notably less responsiv e to downward pressure from labor market slack than it is when inflation is elevated."
"                                                              5 The simplest accelerationist vers ion of the Phillips curve relates the change  in inflation to the level  of labor market slack; morecomplicated versions also highlight the infl uence of inflation expectations, changes in marginal production costs, and other factors."
" Evidence for the United States and other countries that the sensitivity of inflation to resource slack may be nonlinear can be foun d in André Meier (2010), “Still Minding the Gap--Inflation Dynamics during Episodes of Persistent Large Output Gaps,” IMF Working Paper WP/10/189 (Washington:  International Monetary Fund, August), www.imf."
" This pileup phenomenon at zero suggests that, even when the unemployment rate was around 10 percent, many firms we re reluctant to cut nominal wage rates."
" In the absence of this ba rrier, nominal gains in wages and unit labor costs would have likely been even more subdued give n the severity of the economic downturn, with the result that inflation would probably now be runni ng at a lower rate."
  Anchored inflation expectations  are another reason why infla tion has remained close to 2 percent in the face of very low resource utilization.
" As shown in  figure 5, survey measures of longerhorizon inflation expectations have remained  nearly constant since the mid1990s even as actual inflation has fluctuated."
" As a result, th e current slump has not generated the downward spiral of falling expected and actual inflation th at a simple accelerationi st model of inflation might have predicted."
" Indeed, keeping inflati on expectations from d eclining has been an important success of monetary policy over the past few years."
" At the same time, the fact that longerterm inflation expectati ons have not risen above 2 perc ent has also proved extremely                                                             6 The data shown in figure 4 refer to the change in wa ges over the 12 months to March 2010."
" Sim ilar results, based on a different source of data, are reported in Mary Daly, Bart Hobijn, and Brian Lucking (2012), “Why Has Wage Growth Stayed Strong?” Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, FRBSF  Economic Letter  201210, April 2, www.frbsf.org/publications/economics/letter/2012/el201210.h tml."
"- 8 -  valuable, for it has freed the FOMC to take st rong actions to support the economic recovery without greatly worrying that higher energy and commodity prices would become ingrained in inflation and inflation expecta tions, as they did in the 1970s."
"While my modal outlook calls for only a gra dual reduction in labor market slack and a stable pace of inflation near th e FOMC’s longerrun objective of 2 percent, I see substantial risks to this outlook, particularly to the downside."
" However, federal fiscal policy could turn even more restrictive if the Congress does not reach agreement on several important tax and budget policy i ssues before the end of  this year; in fact, the CBO recently warned that the potential hit to gross domestic product (GDP) growth could be sufficient to push the econo my into recession in 2013.7  The deterioration of financial conditions in Europe of late, coupled with  notable declines in global equ ity markets, also serve as a reminder that highly destabilizing outcomes cannot be ruled out."
" Finall y, besides these clearly identifiable sources of risk, there remains th e broader issue that economic forecasters have repeatedly overestimated the strength of the recovery and so still may be too optimistic about the prospects that growth  will strengthen."
" Although I view the bulk of the increase in  unemployment since 2007 as cyclical, I am concerned that it could become a permanent problem  if the recovery were to stall."
" Continued high unemployment could wreak longte rm damage by eroding the skills and labor                                                             7 See Congressional Budget Office (2012), Economic Effects of Reducing the Fiscal Restraint That Is Scheduled to Occur in 2013  (Washington:  CBO, May), www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/FiscalRestraint_0.pdf."
"  - 9 -  force attachment of workers suffering longte rm unemployment, thereby turning what was initially cyclical into structural unemployment."
 This risk provides another important reason to support the recovery by maintaining a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy.
"The Conduct of Policy with  Unconventional Tools  Now turning to monetary policy, I will begin by discussing the FOMC’s reliance on unconventional tools to address the disappointing pace of recovery."
 Figure 6 illustrate s the magnitude of the disappoi ntment by comparing Blue Chip forecasts for real GDP growth made two years ag o with ones made earlier this year.
" However, actual growth in 2011 and early 2012 ha s turned out to be much w eaker than expected, and, as indicated by the dotted red line, private forecast ers now anticipate only a modest acceleration in real activity over the next few years."
 Figure 7 illustrates how dramatically forecasters’ expectati ons of future shortterm interest rates have changed.
" As the dashed blue line indicates, the Blue Chip consensus forecast made in early 2010 anticipated that the Treasuryb ill rate would now stand at cl ose to 31/2 percent; today, in contrast, private forecasters expe ct shortterm interest rates to remain very low in 2014."
"  Of course, much of this revision in interest rate projections would likely have occurred in the absence of explicit forward guidance; given th e deterioration in projec tions of real activity due to the unanticipated pers istence of headwinds, and the continued subdued outlook for inflation, forecasters would naturally have antici pated a greater need for the FOMC to provide continued monetary accommodation."
"- 11 -  forecasters and market participan ts appear to have marked down their expectations for future shortterm interest rates by more than they otherwise would have, thereby putting additional downward pressure on longterm interest rates,  improving broader financial conditions, and lending support to aggregate demand."

" A wide range of such rules has been examined in the academic literature, the most famous of which is that proposed by John Taylor in his 1993 study.13  Rules of the general sort proposed by Ta ylor (1993) capture well our statutory mandate to promote maximum employment and price stabili ty by prescribing that the federal funds rate should respond to the deviation of inflation from  its longerrun goal and to the output gap, given that the economy should be at or close to full employment when  the output gap--the difference between actual GDP and an estimate of potential output--is closed."
" In my view, this latter rule is more consistent with the FOMC’s commitment to                                                             12 The term premium effect also wanes over time because th e size of the effect depends on the expected difference between the actual size of the balance sheet now and in the future and its normal size, where the latter is rising steadily over time, primarily as a result of the trend growth in currency."
"Williams (2011), “Simple and Robust Rules for Monetary Policy,” in Benjamin M."
"- 14 -  follow a balanced approach to promoting our du al mandate, and so I will refer to it as the “balancedapproach” rule.15 To show the prescriptions these rules would have called for at the April FOMC meeting, I start with an illustrative baseline outlook constructed using the projections for unemployment, inflation, and the federal funds rate that  FOMC participants reported in April.16  I then employ the dynamics of one of the Federal Reserve’s eco nomic models, the FRB/US model, to solve for the joint paths of these three variables if the shortterm interest rate had instead been set according to the Taylor (1993) rule or the balanc edapproach rule, subject, in both cases, to the zero lower bound constraint on the fe deral funds rate."
" The dashed red line in figure 10 shows the resulting path for the federal funds rate under Ta ylor (1993) and the soli d blue line with open circles illustrates the corresponding path  using the balancedapproach rule.17  In both simulations, the private sector fu lly understands that monetary po licy follows the particular rule in force.18  Figure 10 shows that the Tayl or rule calls for monetary policy to tighten immediately, while the balancedapproach rule pr escribes raising the federal funds rate in the fourth quarter of                                                             15 The balancedapproach rule is defined as Rt = 2 + πt + 0.5(πt - 2) + 1.0 Yt.  In this expression, R is the federal funds rate, π is the percent change in the headline personal consumption expenditures price index from four quarters earlier, and Y is the output gap."
 Since Taylor’s own strong preference is for his original rule--Taylor (1993)--I now refer to the later rule as the “balancedapproach rule.” 16 The baseline paths for unemployment and inflation track the midpoint of the central tendency of the Committee’s projections through 2014 and thereafter gradually conver ge to values consistent with participants’ longrun projections.
" For further details on the construction of the baseline, see Yellen, “The Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy,” in note 2."
" The output gap is approximated using Okun’s law; specifically, Yt = 2.3(5.6Ut), where 2.3 is the estimated value of the O kun’s law coefficient and 5.6 is the assumed value of the nonaccelerating inflation rate of unemployment, or NAIRU."
" The loss function attempts to quantify the social co sts resulting from deviations of inflation from the Committee’s longerrun goal and from devi ations of unemployment from its longerrun normal rate.19  The solid green line with dots in figure  10 shows the “optimal control” path for the federal funds rate, again conditioned on the ill ustrative ba seline outlook.20  This policy involves keeping the federal funds rate close to zero until late 2015, four quarters longer than the balancedapproach rule prescripti on and several years longer than the Taylor rule."
" Importantly, optimal control calls for a later liftoff date even though this benchmark--unlike the simple policy rules--implicitly takes full account of the a dditional stimulus to real activity and inflation                                                             19 Under this approach, the central bank’s plans are assumed to  be completely transparent and credible to the public."
" In particular, both the policymaker and private agents are assumed to act as if  they have perfect foresight about the evolution of the economy, including the future path of monetary policy, in that they ignore the possibility of unanticipated future shocks to the economy."
" First, the FRB/US m odel’s projections of real activity, inflation, and interest rates are adjusted to replicate the base line forecast values."
" For the purposes of the exercise, the loss function is equal to the cumulative discounted sum from 2012:Q2 through 2025:Q4 of three factors--the squared deviation of the unemployment rate from 51/2 percent, the squared deviation of overall PCE inflation from 2 percent, and the squared quarterly change in the federal funds rate."
 The third term is added to damp quarterto-quarter movements in interest rates.
"- 16 -  being provided over time by the Federal Reserv e’s other policy tool, the past and projected changes to the size and matur ity of its securities holdings.21    Figure 11 shows that, by keeping the federal funds rate at its  current level for longer, monetary policy under the balanc edapproach rule achieves a more rapid reduction of the unemployment rate than monetary policy under the Taylor (1 993) rule does, while nonetheless keeping inflation near 2 percent."
"  But the improvement in labor market conditions is even more notable under the optimal control path, even as inflation remain s close to the FOMC’s longrun inflation objective."
 A second is that they do not fully take account of the protracted nature of the forces  that have been restraining aggregate demand in the aftermath of the housing bust.
" The headwinds that explain this disappointing perfor mance represent a substantial departure from normal cyclical                                                             21 Optimal control takes account of the s timulus provided by the balance sheet  operations because it conditions on a baseline forecast of real activity and inflation that (at least implicitly) incorporates  the effects of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet operations on projected financial conditions, real activity, and inflation."
" As a result, the economy’s equilibrium r eal federal funds rate--that is, the rate that would be consistent with full employment ove r the medium run--is probably well below its historical average, which the in tercept of simple po licy rules is supposed to approximate."
" If the Committee were to judge that the recovery is unlikely to pr oceed at a satisfactory pace (for example, that the forecast entails little or no improvement in the la bor market over the next few years), or that the downside risks to the outlook had become sufficiently  great, or that inflation appeared to be in danger of declining notably below its 2 percent ob jective, I am convinced that scope remains for the FOMC to provide further policy accommoda tion either through its forward guidance or through additional balancesheet actions."
"Dudley (2012), “Conducting Monetary Policy:  Rules, Learning and Risk Management,” speech delivered at the C."
 I disagree with  this view: The FOMC has tested  a variety of tools to ensure that we will be able to raise shortterm interest rates when needed while gradually returning the portfolio to a more normal size a nd composition.
" But even if unjus tified, such concerns could in theory reduce confidence in the Fe deral Reserve and so l ead to an undesired increase in inflation expectations."
"  Conclusion In my remarks this evening I have sought  to explain why, in my view, a highly accommodative monetary policy will remain appropriate for some time to come."
" My views concerning the stance of monetary policy reflect  the FOMC’s firm commitment to the goals of maximum employment and stable prices, my appr aisal of the medium te rm outlook (which is - 19 -  importantly shaped by the persistent legacy of the housing bust and ensuing financial crisis), and by my assessment of the balance of risks facing th e economy."
" For this reason, the FOMC’s forward guidance is explicitly conditioned on its anticipation of “low ra tes of resource utiliz ation and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run.”23  If the recovery were to proceed faster  than expected or if inflation pressures were to pick up materially, the FOMC could adjust policy by bri nging forward the expected date of tightening."

  •Simple Phillips curve model predicts downward pressure on inflation from labor market slack.
" •But cross country evidence shows that once inflation is low, it is less responsive to slack."
 •Potential for cyclical unemployment to become structural if the recovery were to stall.
