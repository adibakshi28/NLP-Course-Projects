"For release on delivery  12:20 p.m. EDT    March 23 , 2015         Monetary Policy Lessons and the Way Ahead     Remarks by   Stanley Fischer   Vice Chair man  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at the  Economic Club of New York   New York, New York         March 23 , 2015    For over  six years, the federal funds rate has , effectively,  been zero."
" However it is widely expected that the rate will lift off before the end of this year, as the normalization of monetary policy gets underway."
  The approach of liftoff reflects the significant progress we have made toward our objectives of maximum employment and price stability.
" The extraordinary monetary policy accommodation that the Federal Reserve has undertaken in response to the crisis has contributed importantly to the economic recovery, though the recovery has taken longer than we expected."
" T he unemployment rate , at 5.5 percent in February, is nearing estimates of its natural rate, and we expect that inflation will gradually rise toward  the Fed’s target of 2 percent."
" Beginning the normalization of policy will be a significant step toward the restoration of the economy’s normal dynamics, allowing monetary policy to  respond to shocks without recourse to unconventional tools."
"  I would like to take this occasion to look back on some lessons learned during our time at the effective lower bound on the interest rate , and also to look forward.1 Monetary Policy since the C risis  Let me first take a step back in time."
" 6 On October 8, 2008, the Federal Reserve and five other major central banks jointly announced a reduction in policy interest rates."
" In the United States, when the Federal Reserve sought to pr ovide more accommodation despite the federal funds rate being, essentially, zero, we chose not to use negative rates, judging at the time that the small additional support for aggregate demand was not worth the accompanying risks to U.S. money markets and the intermediation of credit."
"With the federal funds rate near zero and the Fed creating and adjusting new asset purchase programs, it became difficult for the public to anticipate how the FOMC would likely conduct monetary policy and respond to changing economic conditions."
" The early literature focused on the inability of central banks, in normal times, to commit to high future interest rates and low inflation."
" Interestingly, at the zero lower bound, centra l banks may face nearly the opposite commitment problem:  To escape a liquidity trap, a central bank may want to commit to keep interest rates low and accommodate an output boom even after the headwinds from a crisis have dissipated."
" When interest rates are extremely low, risks to financial stability might grow."
" Interestingly, the  asset purchases recently announced by the European Central Bank (ECB) appear to be putting downward pressure on longer -term interest rates in the United States ."
" In addition, the ECB’s policy should increase growth in Europe , which will be  beneficial for U.S. exports ."
" Though it is likely that remittances to the Tr easury will decline later in the decade as interest rates increase, such developments would not impair the Federal Reserve’s conduct of monetary policy, and it is highly likely that average annual remittances over the period affected by our asset purchases  will be higher than pre -crisis norms."
" In addition, the asset purchases also affect Treasury revenue by lifting economic activity and thereby tax revenue, as well as by lowering interest rates and thereby debt service costs."
" The slow recovery provides more evidence that severe financial crises have longlived effects, as Reinhart and Rogoff , and others, have documented.14   The gradual pace of the recovery has likely reflected both demand and supply factors ."
" With respect to aggregate demand , the economy faced several  important headwinds: efforts by households and businesses to rebuild their balance sheets, persistently tight credit conditions, the extreme weakness of the housing sector, the significant drag  from fiscal policy  in the years from 2011 to 2013, and the growth slowdown in Europe and other parts of the world."
"  Turning to aggregate supply, it appears that productivity growth has slowed.15  One notable manifestation of slow productivity growth is that last year, unemployment fell significantly further than we had anticipated as of the start of the year --a pattern that occurred in the prior four years as well --whereas gross domestic product  growth fell short of our expectations, as it ha d in three of the four prior years."
" However, productivity is  13 See, for example, Yellen (2011)."
 15 The slowdown in productivity growth may predate the recession and may have been exacerbated by it.
" For my part, I believe that t he enormous gains in human welfare that the information technology  explosion seem s to be generating are likely to continue, and will perhaps event ually return measured productivity growth to its long -run historical pace."
 Liftoff should occur when the expected return from raising the interest rate outweighs the expected costs of doing so.
" In deciding when that time has come, we will continue to monitor a wide range of information  regarding labo r market conditions, inflation, and financial and international developments."
 We anticipate that it will be appropriate to raise the target range when there has been further improvement in the labor market and we are reasonably confident that inflation wi ll move back to our 2 percent objective over the medium term.
 Policy N ormalization  Full normalization of monetary policy would allow the Fed to rely on its traditional policy framework of adjustments to the federal funds rate.
" However, as long as our bal ance sheet remains sizable, we will not be able to implement monetary policy with our traditional tool of repurchases."
" Because ON RRP co unterparties include many money market participants that are not eligible to receive IOER , the facility c an be a powerful tool for controlling money market interest rates ."
" In addition, in times of stress, demand for the safety and liquidity of ON RRPs with the central bank might increase sharply, potenti ally exacerbat ing disruptive flightto-quality flows.18  To mitigate these risks, the FOMC has agreed that it will use an ON RRP facility only to the extent necessary and will phase it out when it is no longer needed."
" In part because of this adaptability, I am confident that by using IOER and, as needed, these supplementary tools, we will be able to raise short -term interest rates when it becomes appropriate."
"  Mon etary Policy after Liftoff  The focus of the great bulk of the discussion on monetary policy during the last  few years, has been on liftoff --on the circumstances under which the FOMC will choose to raise the federal funds rate, on the date on which t hat will happen, and on the effe ct of the Fed’s very large portfolio on how it will manage the liftoff process."
" Accordingly,  discussion of monetary policy needs to begin to shift to the future path of  - 10 - interest rates, and thus to the basis on which the FOMC will set interest rates following liftoff."
" Standard in terest rate projections might incline one to believe that the path of the federal funds r ate after liftoff will consist of a steady rate of increase from zero to the longer -run normal nominal federal funds rate, which will be equal to the natural real rate of interest plus our 2 percent  inflation goal ."
" But a smooth path upward in the federal funds rate will almost certainly not be realized , because, inevitably, the economy will encounter shocks --shocks like the unexpected decline in the price of oil, or geopolitical developments that may have major budgetary and confidence implications, or a burst of greater productivity growth, as the Fed dealt with in the mid1990s ."
" Accordingly there is considerable uncertainty about the l evel of future interest rates --a degree of uncertainty that can be estimated statistically, and that should be taken into account by market participants and recognized by the FOMC when it discusses future levels of interest rates."
" The uncertainty about future levels of the federal funds rate can be represented in a “ fan chart ”--that is, a figure showing the expected path of the federal funds rate as well as a range representing the degree of uncertainty around that path.20      The two sure elements of forward guidance that the FOMC will be able to offer after liftoff are that monetary policy will continue to be aimed at fostering the Committee’s dual objectives, and that it will be data driven."
" Whatever the  state of the economy, the federal funds rate will be set at each FOMC meeting on the basis of what the members of the FOMC believe will best enable us to meet our dual goals of maximum employment and price stability over the course of time."
" As the FOMC  responds to incoming information, it will continue to be absolutely transparent in explaining its decisions and how and why they contribute to meeting the legally mandated dual goals of monetary policy."
"                                                   - 12 - best way of ensuring that monetary policy decision makers continue to follow sensible and rational policies; and third, it is the best way of informing the private sector of the basis on which monetary policy decisions are made and will continue to be made."
 With respect to forward guidance: its role has been and continues to be important in the long period in which eventual liftoff has been the key interest rate decision confronting the F OMC and the focus of market expectations.
" However, as monetary policy is normalized, interest rates will sometimes have to be  increased, and sometimes decreased."
" Market participants will be able to form their expectations of future interest rates on the basis of three elements: first, the policy record of the FOMC, which might be approximated as a reaction function; second, their analysis of the current economic and financial situation and outlook; and , third, whatever guidance the FOMC will provide as to how it sees monetary policy decisions likely to unfold given the economic situation and outlook."
 It is likely that explicit long -term forward guidance will play less of  a role in monetary policy after liftoff than it has during the past few years .
"Policy makers’ behavior is sometimes summarized as a reaction function, which can be  an algebraic description of how the  interest rate is set --for instance, a Taylor -type rule in which the federal funds rate reacts simultaneously to the rate of inflation and expectations of inflation as well as to the rate of unemployment and expected changes in the level of unemployment.21  However, a simple rule of that sort will, by necessity, leave out many factors that appropriately influence monetary policy, such as financial  developments, temporary divergences in relationships between different measures of 21 Svensson (1997) notes that the reaction function might take the form of a “targ eting rule” expressing how the policymaker’s target variables are expected to move over time."
"                                                    - 13 - economic activity or inflation, and the like."
" A simple rule can provide the starting point for the decisions made by the FOMC, but in reaching their interest rate decision, members of the Committee will always have to use their judgment to identify the special circumstances confronting the economy, and how to react to them."
" To ensure that monetary policy operates in as stabilizing a way as possible, the FOMC will continue to set out , as clearly as it can , the basis of every decision that it makes, and to provide guidance on its expectations of future decisions."
