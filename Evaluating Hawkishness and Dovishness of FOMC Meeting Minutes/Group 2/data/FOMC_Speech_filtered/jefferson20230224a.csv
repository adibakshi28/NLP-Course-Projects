"For release on delivery  10:15 a.m. EST  February 24, 2023         Discussion of the Paper “Managing Disinflations”  by Stephen G."
"Jefferson   Member   Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at the   U.S. Monetary Policy Forum   New York, New York         February 24, 2023   Thank you very much for inviting me to discuss this paper."
" It is a timely review for central bankers charged with lowering inflation to targets or, in the terminology of the authors, managing disinflation."
" In the first part, the authors review historical disinflationary episodes in the U nited States and other countries to  see what lessons we might learn from past experience."
" In the second part, the authors present a simple, tractable model  that relates interest rates , inflation, inflation expectations, and slack in the labor market."
 They use the model to make predictions about future inflation.
"In the third part, the authors provide a dvice to monetary policymakers on how to address the current situation ; that is, how to manage disinflation."
"  The authors’ first takeaway, based on past disinflation episodes in the United States and abroad, is that policymakers should expect that disinflation will be  costly  in terms of foregone output or employment."
" They find that all 16 of the large policy -induced disinflations in the four advanced economies they study were associated with a  - 2 - recession .1 As the paper makes clear, however, a good measure of judgment comes into the exercise of identifying and quantifying disinflationary episodes."
" These factors include supply shocks, labor market structure, economi c conditions at the start of the disinflationary episode, how “well anchored” are inflation expectations, and the speed at which a disinflation is carried out."
" And while one may quibble with bits and pie ces, their argument that policymakers should accept that disinflation is likely to be costly is well reasoned."
 The state dependency they note is that a higher initial inflation rate is associated with a lower sacrifice ratio .
" Specifically, they argue that a high initial inflation rate enhances the plausibility of central banks’ willingness to incur the cost of reducing inflation."
 Central bankers are constantly warning of combat ting inflationary shocks before those forces become embedded in inflation expectations.2 The Volcker disinflation of 1981–82  1 They draw this conclusion by replicating some of the methodology from the literature on sacrifice ratios.
" 2 For example, Chair Powell, in testimony before the U.S. Senate, said, “ We will use our tools to support the economy and a strong labor market and to prevent higher inflation from becoming entrenched” (Powell, 2022a)."
" This reasoning has a lengthy history, as evidenced by  remarks in 2008 by then Vice  Chair of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System  Donald Kohn:  “ As demonstrated by historical experiences around the world and in the United States during the 1970s and 1980s, efforts to bring inflation and inflation expectations back to desirable levels after they have risen appreciably involve costly and undesirable changes in resource utilization” (Kohn, 2008)."
" And the sentiment is shared internationally, as remarks by Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem attest:   “If we don’t do enough [policy tightening], Canadians will continue to endure the hardship of high inflation."
" And they will come to expect persistently high inflation, which will require much higher interest rates and, potentially, a severe recession to control inflation."
 But the reduction in inflation was large.
" Thus, measured in terms of percentage points of infla tion reduction, as is conventionally done, it was not particularly costly.3  A plausible, if partial, explanation for this finding is that the Volcker disinflation was carried out before  the inflation associated with the second OPEC oil price shock had be come entrenched in inflation expectations and more generally at a time when inflation expectations were fluid.4  This is relevant as my colleagues on the FOMC and I strive to bring down actual inflation promptly in order to preserve the “well anchored” longer -term inflation expectations we see in the data."
 It is also consistent with the authors’ argument that swift and relatively painless disinflations of the past were due to early and sharp policy interest rate increases.
"  The authors’ third takeaway fr om history is  that easing monetary policy before the disinflation is complete, or easing by too much, is costly.5  My reading of this claim is that while central bankers might entertain hopes that they will directly see a dividend from early, forceful pol icy actions, historical experience suggests that they should not count on such a favorable outcome."
" As I’ll discuss in a minute, choosing the appropriate stance of monetary policy,  3 Converting the unemployment sacrifice ratio in Ball (1994) into output space using an Okun coefficient of two renders an output sacrifice ratio of just 1.8, a small number by histori cal standards."
" 4 This may be related to the authors’ second conjecture on why initially high levels of inflation are associated with lower sacrifice ratios —namely, that high inflation is associated with large global supply shocks (Cecchetti and others, 2023, p."
" It is analytically distinct, however, in that they do not emphasize the timely monetary policy response to those shocks."
" As you have already heard, the authors outline a very simple model that relate s interest rates, slack in the economy, inflation, and inflation expectations."
" They use this model to forecast inflation in the year 2021 and evaluate the model’s predictive performance, employing alternative measures of slack, linear and nonlinear relati onships, and different sample periods."
"  The models do a little better when you allow them to see data from the era of high and volatile inflation in the 1960s and ’70s instead of restricting consideration to the Great Moderation period, as empirical tests for structural breaks would surely have suggested.6  Two  key and related reason s for this improvement are  that inflation expectations in the 1960s and 1970s were  more persistent and that the slope of the empirical Phillips curve was steeper than during recent history."
" In particular, the authors contend, on page 19, that “ the apparent anchoring of longterm [inflation] expectations may reflect in part the FOMC’s unanticipated shift toward aggressive rate hikes.”  In addition, despite the rapid tightening to date, the authors contend that additional monetary  6 The borderline, as it were, between the inflationary era that the authors argue is critical for obtaining plausible results in their conditional forecasting exercise and the Great Moderation period is the Volcker disinflation of 1981 –82."
 Sims and Zha (2006) argue that the Volcker disinflation is the only regime shift that can be unequivocally shown to be present in the data over the postwar period in their sample.
  - 5 - policy tightening is likely to prove necessary to achieve 2 percent inflation by 2025 and is likely to lead to a mild recession.
 The authors favor aggressive monetary policy tightening—or preemption —over gradualism.
 And they argue that the costs of increasing the target rate of inflation outweigh the benefits  because t he loss of credibility from showing a lack of resolve to achieve 2 percent inflation will persist.
" First, figure 4.1 in the paper demonstrates that, standing at the end of 2020, it would have been difficult to forecast the increase in inflation we observed in 2021 and 2022:  The out -ofsample forecasts are far below the actual."
" It’s just very difficult to formulate forecasts and implement preemptive monetary policy in real time, espec ially under such extraordinary circumstances."
 But current inflation dynamics are being driven by some pandemic -specific factors not seen in the historical data.
 It follows that policymakers need  to look at a broader range of  factors to understand recent inflation dynamics .
  - 6 - Let me illustrate this point by considering three large categories that make up  core  personal consumption expenditures inflation.
" These are  core goods inflation, housing services inflation , and inflation in core services excluding housing."
" Some of these forces are pandemic specific, and u nderstanding the different causes s hould help us predict what will happen to inflation going forward."
"  Focusing on the price of core goods, the black line in the chart, you can see how goods prices started climbing in the second half of 2020 and rose sharply in 2021 as the pandemic -driven disruptions to social interactions induced a rapid shift in demand from services to goods, exacerbating snags in global supply chain s."
" Thus, inflation in this category came down substantially over the course of 2022."
" The strengthening of the overall economy may have played a role in core goods price inflation, but  it was likely secondary to the roles played by goods -specific demand and by the production and distribution network for goods over this period."
" In contrast, housing services inflation , the blue line in the chart, picked up appreciably in 2022 after havin g softened early in the pandemic."
 Inflation in this sector is also driven by certain pandemic -specific factors.
" In particular, t he surge in work from home led to an abrupt increase in the demand for bigger homes located in smaller metro areas or further from city centers ."
" We have not seen a decline in housing services inflation  yet, but recent data on new leases and lease renewals indicate  that we soon will ."
" Lastly, we have inflation in other core service s, the red line in  - 7 - the graph, a large category that covers activities as varied as travel and recreation, and medical and legal services."
" Inflation for these services , most of which are labor intensive, has remained stubbornly high."
" An  important source o f inflation pressures in this category has likely been the shortage of workers, which has pushed up labor costs at rates above those consistent with 2 percent inflation ."
 The inflation outlook for this nonhousing category of core services will likely depend in large part on whether labor demand moves into better balance with labor supply and growth  in nominal labor costs .
 Recent data suggest that labor  compensation has indeed started to decelerate somewhat over the past year  but is still running too high t o be consistent with returning inflation to 2 percent in a timely and sustainable fashion.
" The point is that the inflationary forces impinging on the U.S. economy at present represent a complex mixture of temporary and more longlasting elements that defy  simple, parsimonious explanation."
" The ongoing imbalance between the supply and demand for  labor , combined with the large share of labor costs in the services sector, suggests that high inflation may come down only slowly."
" The paper notes the role of cent ral bank credibility in managing disinflations, but I do not attribute the persistence in inflation to  a lack of Fed credibility ."
" Indeed, there is evidence in support of central bank credibility, including that longterm inflation expectations are not far from the FOMC’s 2 percent target."
" Fourth and most importantly, unlike in the late 1960s and 1970s, the Federal Reserve is addressing the outbreak in inflation promptly and forcefully to maintain that credibility and to preserve the “well anchored” property of longterm inflation expectations."
