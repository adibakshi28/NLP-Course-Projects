"For release on delivery  10:00 a.m. EDT  (8:00 a.m. MDT)  August  22, 2014        Labor Market Dynamics and Monetary Policy     Remarks by   Janet L."
"Yellen   Chair   Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at the  Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City Economic Symposium   Jackson Hole, Wyoming         August  22, 2014   In the five years since the end of the Great Recession, the economy has made considerable progress in recovering from the largest and most sustained loss of employment in the United States since the Great Depression.1  More jobs have now been created in the recovery than were lost in the downturn, with payroll employment in May of this year finally exceeding the previous peak in January 2008."
" The unemployment rate, at 6.2 percent  in July, has declined nearly 4  percentage points from  its late 2009 peak."
" Over the p ast year, the unemployment rate has fallen considerably, and at a surprisingly rapid pace."
  The Federal Reserve’s monetary polic y objective is to foster maximum employment and price stability .
" In this regard, a key challenge is to assess just how far the economy now stands from the attainment of its maximum employment goal."
"    These and other questions about the labor market are central to the conduct of monetary policy, so I am pleased that the organizers of this year’s symposium chose labor market dynamics as its theme."
" I expect,                                                  1 Nonfarm employment contracted by 6.3 percent from its peak in 2008 to its trough in early 2010, compared with a 5.2 percent loss in the 1948 -49 recession, previously the largest since the 1930s."
"  - 2 - however, that our understanding of labor market developments and their potential implications for inflation will remain far from perfect."
" As a consequence, monetary policy ultimately must  be conducted in a pragmatic manner that relies not on any particular indicator or model, but instead reflects an ongoing assessment of a wide range of information in the context of our ever -evolving understanding of the economy ."
" The Labor Market Recovery  and Monetary Policy  In my remarks this morning, I will review a number of developments relat ed to the functioning of the labor market that have made it more difficult to judge the remaining degree of slack."
 Differing interpretations of these developments  affect judgments concerning the appropriate path of monetary policy.
" Before turning to the specifics, however, I  woul d like to provide some context concerning the role of the labor market in shaping monetary policy over the past several years."
" During th at time, the FOMC has maintained a highly accommodative monetary policy in pursuit of its congressionally mandated goals of maximum employment a nd stable prices."
" The Committee judged such a stance appropriate because infl ation has fallen short of our 2 percent objective while the labor market, until recently, operated very far from any reasonable definition of  maximum employment."
   The FOMC’s current program of asset purchases began when the unemployment rate stood at 8.1 percent and progress in lowering i t was expected to be much slower than desired.
" In addition, in December 2012, the Committee modified its forward guidance for the federal  - 3 - funds rate, stating that “as long as the unemployment rate remain s above 6 -1/2 percent, inflation between one and two years a head is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee’s  2 percent longer -run goal, and  longer -term inflation expectations continu e to be well  anchored, ” the Committee would not even consider raising the federal funds rate above t he 0 to 1/4 percent range.2  This “threshold  based” forward guidance was deemed appropriate under conditions in which inflation was subdued and the economy remained unambiguously far from maximum employment."
"  Earlier this year, however, with the unemployment rate declining faster than had been anticipated and nearing the 6 -1/2 percent threshold , the FOMC recast its forward guidance, stating that “in determining how long to maintain the current 0  to 1/4 percent target range for the federal funds ra te, the Committee would assess progress --both realized and expected --toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation .”3  As the recovery progresses, assessments of the degree of remaining slack in the labor market need to become more nu anced because of considerable uncertainty  about the level of employment consistent with the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate."
" Indeed, in its 2012 statement on longer -run goals and monetary policy strategy, the FOMC explicitly recognized that factors determi ning maximum employment “may change over time and may not be directly measurable,” and that assessments of the level of maximum employment “are necessarily uncertain and subject to revision.”4  Accordingly, the                                                  2 See paragraph 5 in Board of Governors of the Federal Reser ve System (2012), “ Federal Reserve I ssues FOMC Statement ,” press release, December  12, www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20121212a.htm ."
"  - 4 - reformulated forward guidance reaffirms the F OMC’s view that policy decisions will not be based on any single indicator, but will instead take into account a wide  range of information on the labor market, as well as inflation and financial developments.5 Interpreting Labor Market Surprises:  Past and  Future  The assessment of labor market slack is rarely simple and has been especially challenging recently."
" Estimates of slack necessitate difficult judgments about the magnitudes of the cyclical and structural influences affecting labor market variables,  including labor force participation, the extent of part -time employment for economic reasons, and labor market flows, such as the pace of hires and quits."
" A considerable body of research suggests that the behavior of these and other labor market variable s has changed since the Great Recession.6  Along with cyclical influences, significant structural factors have affected the labor market, including the aging of the workforce and other demographic trends, possible changes in the underlying degree of dynami sm in the labor  market, and the phenomenon of “polarization” --that is, the reduction in the relative number of middle -skill jobs.7                                                    5 The central role of labor market conditions in monetary policy deliberations has also been apparent abroad ."
" Last year the Bank of England announced its inte ntion not to raise its policy rate at least until the unemployment rate reached 7 percent,  subject to conditions on inflation and financial stability."
" Since that time, the unemployment rate in the United Kingdom has dropped unexpectedly rapidly , prompting policymakers  to consider data beyond this single indicator when assessing the extent of spare capacity in the U.K. economy ."
" As in the United States, an unexpectedly swift decline in unemployment has raised questions about the structural and cy clical effects of a severe recession."
" For a discussion of the strategic issues that arise when policymakers believe such evolut ion from cyclical to structural to be an important feature of the economy, see Dave Reifschneider, William Wascher, and David Wilcox (2013), “Aggregate Supply in the United States:  Recent Developments and Implications for the Conduct of Monetary Policy,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2013 -77 (Washington:  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, November), www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2013/201377/201377abs.html."
"  - 5 - Consider first the behavior of the labor force participation rate, which has declined substantially since the end of the recession even as the unemployment rate has fallen."
" As a consequence, the employment -topopulation ratio has increased far less over the past several years than the unemployment rate alone would indicate, based on past experience."
" If the cyclical component is abnormally large, relative to the unemployment rate, then it might be seen as an additional contributor to labor market slack."
" As an accounting matter, the drop in the participation rate since 2008 can be  attributed to increases in four factors:  retirement, disability, school enrollment, and other reasons, including worker discouragement.8  Of these, greater worker discouragement is most directly the result of a weak labor market, so we could reasonably e xpect further increases in labor demand to pull a sizable share of discouraged workers back into the workforce."
"Cutler, Ellen Meara, and Seth Richards -Shubik (2012), “Unemployment and  Disability:  Evidence from the Great Recession,” NBER Retirement Research Center Paper Series NB 1212 (Cambridge, Mass.:  National Bureau of Economic Research, September)."
" For research showing that the high numbers of workers seeking disability status is correlated with sectoral employment declines and demographics and not corre lated with the rate of workplace injuries, see Norma B."
" At nearly 5 percent of the labor force, the number of such workers is notably larger, relative to the unemployment rate, than has been typ ical historically, providing another reason why the current level of  the unemployment rate may understate the amount of remaining slack  in the labor market."
" For example, the ongoing shift in employment away from  goods  produc tion and toward services, a sector which historically ha s used a greater portion of parttime workers, may be boosting the share  of part -time jobs."
" Likewise, the continuing decline of middle -skill jobs, some of which could be replaced by part -time jobs, may raise the share  of part -time jobs in overall employment.12  Despite these challenges in assessing where the share  of those emp loyed part time for economic reasons may settle in                                                  11 The effects of the Great Recession on retirements are difficult to identify."
"  - 8 - the long run, the sharp run -up in involuntary part -time employment during the recession and its slow decline thereafter suggest that cyclical factors are significant."
" Given the rise in job vacancies, hiring may be poised to pick up, but the failure of hiring to rise with vacancies could also indicate that firms perceive the prospects for economic growth as still insufficient to justify adding to payrolls."

  - 9 - that weak aggregate demand has contributed significantly to the depressed levels of quits and hires during the recession and in the recovery.
" Following this methodology, Federal Reserve Board staff developed a labor market conditions index from 19 labor market indicators, including  four I just discussed.14  This broadly based metric supports the conclusion that the labor market has improved significantly over the past year, but it also suggests that the decline in the unemployment rate over this period somewhat overstates the improve ment in overall labor market conditions."
" Over the past several years, wage inflation, as measured by several different indexes, has averaged about 2 percent , and there  has been little evidence of any broad -based acceleration in either wages or compensation."
" Indeed, in real terms, wages have been about flat, growing less than labor productivity."
 This pattern of subdued real wage gains suggests that nominal compensation could rise more quickly without exerting any meaningful upward pressure on inflation.
 - 10 - behavior of both nominal and real wages point to weaker labor market conditions than would be indicated by the current unemployment rate.
" First, the sluggish pace of nominal and real  wage growth in recent years may reflect the phenomenon of “ pentup wage deflation."
" If pent -up wage deflation is ho lding down wage growth, the current very moderate wage growth could be a misleading signal of the degree of remaining slack."
" As I noted, real wages have been rising less rapidly than productivity, implying that real unit labor costs ha ve been declining, a pattern suggesting that there is scope for nominal wages to accelerate from their recent pace without creating meaningful inflationary pressure."
" - 11 - secular factors that predate the recession, including changing patterns of production and international trade, as well as measurement issues.16  If so, productivity growth  could continue to  outpace real wage gains even when the economy is again operating at its potential."
" A third issue that complicates the interpretation of wage trends is the possibility that, because of  the dislocations of the Great Recession, transitory wage and price pressures could emerge well before maximum sustainable employment has been reached , although they would abate over time as the economy moves back toward maximum employment.17  The argument is that workers who have suffered long -term unemployment --along  with, perhaps, those who have dropped out of the labor force but would return to work in a stronger economy --face significant impediments to reemployment."
" In this case, further improvement in the labor market could entail stronger wage pressures for a time before  maximum employment has been attained.18                                                  16 For a recent study of the decline in labor’s share, see Michael W.L.

" The notion that the labor share of income  is a good measure of slack was prominent in the empirical literature on the New -Keynesian Phillips Curve (for example, see Jordi Galí and Mark Gertler (1999), “Inflation Dynamics:  A Structural Econometric Analysis,” Journal of Monetary Economics , vol."

Gordon  - 12 - Implications of Labor Market Developments for Monetary Policy  The focus of my remarks to this point has been on the functioning of the labor market and how cyclical and structural influences have complicated the task of determining the state of the economy relative to the FOMC’s objective of maximum employment.
" In my remaining time, I will turn to the special challenges that these difficulties in assessing the labor market pose for evaluating the appropriate stance o f monetary policy."
  Any discussion of appropriate monetary policy must be framed by the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability.
" For much of the past five years, the FOMC has been confronted with an obvious and su bstantial degree of slack in the labor market and significant risks of slipping into persistent below -target inflation."
" However, w ith the economy getting closer to  our objectives, the FOMC’s emphasis is naturally shifting to questions about the degree of remaining slack, how                                                  (2013), “The P hillips Curve Is Alive and Well:  Inflation and the NAIRU during the Slow Recovery,” NBER Working Paper Series 19390 (Cambridge, Mass.:  National Bureau of Economic Research, August)."

"     The interaction of labor force participation and inflationary pressures has been understudied, in part because the strong trend s in participation due to demographic factors have implied that it is difficult to identify the cyclical component."
"Levin (2013), “Labor Force Participation and Monetary Policy in the Wake of the Great Recession,” IMF Working Paper WP/13/245 (Washington:  Inte rnational Monetary Fund, July), www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2013/wp13245.pdf."
"  So, what is a monetary policymaker to do?"
" Some have argued that , in light of the uncertainties associated with estimating labor market slack , policymakers should focus mainly on inflation developments in determining appropriate policy."
" To take an extreme case, if labor market slack was the dominant and predictable driver of inflation, we could largely ignore labor market indicators and look i nstead at the behavior of inflation to determine the extent of slack in the labor market."
" In present circumstances, with  inflation still running below the FOMC’s  2 percent objective, such an approach would suggest that we could maintain policy accommodati on until inflation is clearly moving back toward 2 percent, at which point we could also be confident that slack had diminished."
" Historically, slack has accounted for only a small portion of the fluc tuations in inflation."
" Indeed, unusual aspects of the current recovery may have shifted the lead -lag relationship between a tightening labor market and rising inflation pressures in either direction."
" If so, the first clear si gns of inflation pressure could come later than usual in the progression toward maximum employment."
" As a result, maintaining a high degree of monetary policy accommodation until inflation pressures emerge could , in this case , unduly delay the removal of a ccommodation, necessitating an abrupt and potentially disruptive tightening of policy later on."
"  Conversely, profound dislocations in the labor market in recent years --such as depressed participation associated with worker discouragement and a still -subst antial level of long -term unemployment --may cause inflation pressures to arise earlier than  usual as the degree of slack in the labor market declines."
" However, some of the resulting wage and price pressures could subsequently ease as higher real wages dra w workers back into the labor force and lower long -term unemployment.19  As a consequence, tightening monetary policy as soon as inflation moves back toward  2 percent might, in this case, prevent  labor markets from recovering fully and so would not be consi stent with the dual mandate."
 Inferring the degree of resource utilization from real -time readings on inflation is further complicated by the familiar challenge of distinguishing transitory price changes from persistent price pressures.
" Indeed, the recent firming of inflation toward our 2 percent goal appears to reflect a combination of both factors."
"         These complexities in evaluating the relationship between slack and inflation pressures in the current recovery are illustrative of a host of issues that the FOMC will be                                                  19 See Rudebusch and Williams, “A Wedge in the Dual Mandate,” in note 17."
" As the FOMC has noted in its recent policy statements, the stance of policy will be guided by our assessments of how far we are from our objectives of m aximum employment and 2 percent inflation as well as our assessment of the likely pace of progress  toward those objectives."
" Given this assessment and the Committee’s expectation that inflation will gradually move u p toward its longer -run objective, the Committee reaffirmed its view “that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time after our current asset purchase program ends, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee ’s 2 percent longer -run goal, and provided that longer -term inflation expectations remain well anchored .”21  But if progress in the labor market continues to be more rapid than anticipated  by the Committ ee or if inflation moves up more rapidly than anticipated, resulting in faster convergence toward our dual objectives, then increases in the federal funds rate target could come sooner than the Committee currently expects and could be more rapid thereafter ."
" - 16 - economic performance turns out to be disappointing  and progress toward our goals proceeds more slowly than we expect , then the future path of interest rates likely would be more accommodative than we currently anticipate ."
" As I have noted many times, monetary policy is not on a preset path."
 The Committee will be closely monitoring incoming information on the labor market and inflation in determining the appropriate stance of monetary policy.
