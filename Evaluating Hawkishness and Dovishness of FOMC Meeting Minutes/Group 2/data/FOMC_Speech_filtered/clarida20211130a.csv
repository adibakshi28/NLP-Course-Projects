" More than 22 million jobs were lost in just the first two months of the crisis, and the unemployment rate rose from a 50year low of 3.5 percent in February to a postwar peak of almost 15 percent in April 2020."
 A precipitous decline in aggregate demand pummeled the consumer price level.
 The resulting disruptions to economic activity significantly tightened financial conditions and impaired the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.
" The fiscal and monetary policy response in the United States to the COVID crisis was unprecedented in its scale, scope, and speed."
" Like similar in stitutions in other countries —most notably, the Bank of England —the First Bank of the United States was owned by the private sector, was publicly chartered, and carried out some of the operations that would be thought of today as those of a central bank.4  That First Bank played a key role in executing Hamilton’s vision to put the young federal government’s finances on a sound footing, to promote the stabilization of the purchasing power of the U.S. dollar, and to support economic growth."
 This period also witnessed several major financial panics that substantially disrupted economic activity.5  One of those panics —the Panic of 1907—galvanized the Congress to establish a new central bank.
" An  important goal of the Federal Reserve in those early years was to smooth the large seasonal swings in interest rates and credit conditions associated with the harvest season that, in the past, had contributed to financial panics."
" For example, the interest rate charged on discount window loans —rates that had an important bearing on overall financial conditions in the country—was set by Fed eral Reserve policymakers, with little interference from the Congress or the executive branch."
" Decisions regarding open market purchases of U.S. government securities, which were becoming the most important monetary policy tool of the Federal Reserve, were assigned to the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which consi sts of the members of the Board of Governors and a rotating sub set of the Reserve Bank presidents."
 It is al so worth noting a distinction that bears  on decisionmaking powers regarding monetary policy and lending policy.
" In contrast to monetary policy, the power to make decisions about the structure of Federal Reserve lending programs, including the authority to launch emergency programs, resides solely with the Board.8   Subsequent decades saw further changes to the governance of monetary  policy."
" A notable development occurred in 1951, when the Federal Reserve obtained its current level of independence from th e Treasury Department on monetary policy, as codified in the Treasury –Federal Reserve Accord."
" Another milestone occurred with the Federal Reserve Reform Act of 1977, which assigned the Federal Reserve its current statutory mandate to achieve price stabili ty and maximum employment.9  Monetary policy had, in  8 The Federal Reserve Board was given authority to establish lending programs for the nonbanking sector —including households a nd n onfinancial businesses —in unusual a nd exigent circumstances, such a s a  fina ncial crisis."
" The Federal Reserve also had responsibility to seek maximum employment through the Employment Act of  1946, which also directed   - 6 - effect, pursued these goals since the accord, and the Federal Reserve’s maximum -employment and price -stability goals had been embedded in previous acts of the Congress."
" Previously, in early 1975, the Congress had directed the Federal Reserve to pursue “the goals of maximum employment [and] stable prices” in House Concurrent Resolution 133 (March 24, 1975), which was in force over the 1975 −77 Congress alone."

" Reflecting the heightened uncertainty of mid -March 2020, there  was a surge in demand for liquidity across the global financial system."
" The facilities established in 2020, in conjunction with the Federal Reserve’s other actions and a robust fiscal policy response, provided crucial support to the U.S. economy as GDP was collapsing and unemployment was surging."
" Outside of such circumstances, the Federal Reserve has been granted instrument independence by the Congress to set short -term interest rates and to purchase and sell U.S. government securities to achieve its statutorily assigned goals of maximum employment and price stability."
