"For release on delivery  10:40 a.m. E ST (9:40 a.m. CST ) November 17, 2022         Opportunity and Inclusive Economic Growth    Remarks by   Philip N."
"Jefferson   Member   Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at the  2022 Institute Research Conference,  hosted by  the Opportunity and Inclusive Growth Institute  Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis   Minneapolis, Minnesota         November 17, 2022   Good morning , and thank you."
  I would like to use my time today to answer the question posed by the title of this session:  What can the Fed learn from research on opportunity and inclusive growth?
"Some of the Fed’s purview —including  consumer  protection , community  development , and financial stability —can  help to support inclusive growth."
 But monetary policy cannot address these issues directly.
" I do, however, see a direct line between research on opportunity and inclusive growth and our dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability."
" For example, if the channels of upward social mobility are open and working for all, we are likely to see both higher labor market participation and higher productivity—both of which m ake it easier to attain maximum employment amid low and stable inflation."
" First, I would like to address monetary policy."
" Research has shown that the benefits of a  - 2 - strong economy—with high employment and stable prices —are especially significant for less advantaged groups.1  These groups also tend to see the greatest gains later in an expansion, meaning that they benefit the most from sustained periods of growth—like the expansion we were experiencing before the pandemic, which was the longest on record.2  For example, duri ng the pre -pandemic expansion, the long -standing disparity between unemployment rates for prime -age African Americans and Hispanics and their white counterparts began to close."
" At the same time, inflation remained low —lower, in fact, than our 2 percent target for most of that time —and showed little sign of picking up despite the strong labor market."
 It also had a noticeably larger effect on the unemployment rates of women and of Black and Hispanic individuals than it did on most other demographic groups.
" As the economy reopened and began to recover, unemployment rates for those groups initially affected the most—Black and Hispanic workers —also fell more sharply."
"Today, while material disparities  in unemployment rates along racial lines persist, these disparities have almost returned to the narrower ranges we saw just before the pandemic."
"Wilcox (2019), “Okun Revisited:  Who Benefits Most from a  Strong Economy?” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity,  Spring, pp."
"  - 3 - However, as the economy has recovered, strong demand and a variety of supply constraints have contributed to the fastest increases in consumer prices since the early 1980s."
" Inflation, too, has dispro portionate effects on, and is felt most acutely by, those who can least afford it."
" The savings they do have are more likely to be in cash or noninterest -bearing accounts, which means inflation directly erodes the purchasing power of their savings."
 Monetary policy cannot address the specific reasons that low -income households suffer the most from high inflation.
 But these reasons he lp to illustrate the importance of low inflation:  Low inflation is key to achieving a long and sustained expansion—an economy that works for all.
" At the same time, it is critical for monetary policymakers to understand the many and varied conditions that can make our policies more effective in fostering prosperity."
