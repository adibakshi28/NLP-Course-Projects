"  New technologies have  brought tremendous, positive change to  our lives, raising productivity and living standards and contributing to economic growth."
 I think we should recognize that there can be  a tension between the need for financial stability in the overall payment system and the need to innovate to keep up with the demands of modern technology and lifestyles.
" Risk management can act as a mitigant, but if the central asset in a payment system cannot be predictably redeemed for the U.S. dollar at a stable exchange rate in times of adversity, the resulting price risk and pote ntial liquidity and credit risk pose a large challenge for the system."
" During times of crisis, the demand for liquidity can increase significantly, including the demand for the central asset used in settling payments."
" Even private -sector banks and certai nly nonbanks can have a hard time meeting largescale demands for extra liquidity at the very time when                                                            2016095 (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, 2016), www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/feds/2016/files/2 016095pap.pdf ."
" Moreover, this inability to meet the demand for extra liquidity can have spillover effects to other areas of the financial system."
"   Earlier in our history, the United States frequently witnessed bank runs that severely disrupted financial and economic activity, an example of what can happen when people lose faith in a payment system."
" I would urge caution, particularly for countries like the United States with highly developed banking systems and ongoing robust  demand for physical cash."
" For example, if payment  activity radically shifted from using deposits at financial institutions to using centralbank- issued digital currency, deposits c ould significantly shrink and potentially disrupt financial institutionsâ€™ ability to make loans that spur economic activity."
