"  Tonight, i n addition to providing new informat ion about my outlook based on new data, I also want to clarify my views on how the economy has been operating over time and my view of appropriate monetary policy."
" That’s crucial, because monetary policy works mostly by influencing the public’s view of financial and economic conditions well into the future, affect ing spending a nd investment decision s."
" Second, I w ill discuss how I think about lags with which policy a ffects economic activity and inflation and t he impact on the appropriate path of policy."
"   - 2 -  high inflation , I believe that raising the policy rate 25 basis points was  justified."
 I believed t his tightening  would effectively replace some of the tightening that otherwise would have been needed through monetary policy .
"  But by June, there was little evidence that credit conditions were tightening more than would be expected as a result of monetary policy that had already tightened significantly."
" First, it highlights how the appropriate setting for monetary policy shifts over time."
 Monetary Policy Lags  A second issue  for the FOMC is how long it takes for changes in monetary policy to affect economic activity and inflation.
  There is a wide range of views among researchers and  policymakers as to how long it takes for the full effect of monetary policy to register in the economy.
  What I would like to disc uss is expectations for  how long it will take for last year’s sizable monetary policy tightening to show up in the  economic data .
" There are a wide v ariety of   - 5 -  statistical models one can use for this exercise but looking across these models, one gets the rule of thumb that the maximal effects of monetary policy changes will hit the economy with a 12 -month to 24 -month lag."
" In short, from the point of view of the model, the FOMC wakes up one morning and surprises markets with a 25 -basis point hike.2  While this is a fun exercise to see what happens, it doesn’t really capture how monetary policy works  in practice ."
"   - 6 -  when it is credible, financial markets price those expected actions into today’s interest rates ."
 I have argued in the past that the  twoyear Treasury yield is a good proxy for the stance of monetary policy and captures announcement effects.3  The 2 -year  yield went from 25 basis points in September 2021 to around 200 basis points by the March 2022 FOMC meeting.
"Waller (2022), “Reflections on Monetary Policy in 2021,” speech delivered at  the 2022 Hoover Institution Monetary Conference, Stanford, Calif ., May 6, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20220506a.htm ."
4 Recent analysis by Fed economists shows the announcement effects of  policy ha ve in fact led to a shortening  in monetary policy lags.
"Foerster  (2022),  “Have Lags in Monetary Policy Transmission Shortened?"
 It is costly and time consuming to constantl y adjust behavior and portfolios in response to small changes in prices or interest rates.
" For example, large changes in interest rates will get a lot of  attention and have a much faster and dramatic impact on consumption, saving and portfolio allocation ."
" Big changes in p olicy rates will tend to cause more rapid changes in behavior, which  implies monetary policy lags will be shorter when changes to the policy rate are large and rapid ."
"Data sho w that firms typically adjust their prices once a year, which is usually interpreted to mean that prices are “sticky .”  However, recent evidence shows that because of  the big inflation shock that occurred over the past two years, prices have changed more frequently as firms tried to keep their relative prices in line with rapidly changing market conditions."
 This fact has important implications for the Phillips curve model that economists use to link unemployment  and inflation .
" The shift in frequency of price setting will affect the slope  (the coefficient ), which  indicates how sensitive inflation is to a change in unemployment ."
"Waller (202 3), “The Unstable Phillips Curve ,” speech delivered a t Macroeconomics and Monetary Policy, a conference sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, San Francisco, Calif ., Marc h 31, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20230331a.htm ."
    - 9 -  The implication is that unemployment has to increase a lot to bring inflation dow n by a small amount.
 This steepening implies that monetary policy will affect  inflation faster and with less effect on the unemployment rate  than would occur if price cha nges were slower .
" So once again, the lags between changes in monetary policy and inflation should be shorter than historical experience tells us, and as is reflected in models ."
" The effects of p olicy tightening last year are feeding through to market interest rates faster than typically thought because of announcement effects, and on top of this we have had policy rate change s that have been more dramatic and faster than in the past  which most likely has led to a more rapid adjustment in the behavior of households and firms ."
 These two points suggest that the effects  of the large policy changes that we undertook last year should hit economic activity and inflation much faster than is typically predicted .
" If one believes the bulk of the effects from last year’s tightening have passed through the economy already, then we can’t expect much more slowing of demand and inflation from that tightening ."
" To me , this means that the policy tightening we have conducte d this year has been appropriate and also that more policy tightening will be needed to bring inflation back to our 2  percent  target."
" E conomic activity reportedly grew 2 percent in the first quarter , and b ased on economic data   - 10 -  through early July , the Atlanta Fed’s  GDP projection suggests growth was a touch higher in the second quarter."
"  Job growth is still well above the pre -pandemic average,  the unempl oyment rate remains quite low , and wage growth continues to be above what would support returning inflation to 2 percent."
"  Yesterday , we received new data on consumer price index (CPI) inflation."
" After 5 consecutive monthly readings of core inflation of 0.4 percent or above, this rate dropped by half in June , to 0.2 percent."
" Inflation briefly slowed in the summer of 2021 before getting much worse, so I am going to need to see this improvement sustained before I am confident that inflation has decelerated."
"  In terms of the latest banking data, the Federal Reserve’s weekly release of assets and liabilities of commercial banks (the H.8 data release) s uggests that banks are responding in a way that is consistent with monetary policy tightening but not banking   - 11 -  stress ."
" For example, growth in core loans on banks’ books ha s decelerated since late  2022, as banks tightened lending standards and demand slowed amid lagged effects from monetary policy tightening."
" Th ese actions are leading to a slowdown in credit growth, but one that is in line with monetary policy tightening."
" So, what does this mean for monetary policy?"
" With the banking sector sound and resilient, f ighting inflation remains my top priority , and I believe we will get there."
 What will get us there is setting the stance of policy at a level that will continue to help bring supply and demand in the economy into b etter balance .
" While I expect inflation to eventually settle near our 2 percent target because of our policy actions, we have to make sure what we saw in yesterday’s inflation report feeds through broadly across goods and services and that we do not rever t back to what has been persistently high core inflation."
" As things stand now, my outlook for the stance of monetary policy that will get inflation near the FOMC’s 2 percent targe t is roughly consistent with the FOMC’s economic projections in June."
 I see two more 25basis -point hikes in the target range over the four remaining meetings this year as necessary to keep inflation moving toward our target .
" Furthermore, I believe we wi ll need to keep policy restrictive for some time in   - 12 -  order to have inflation settle down around our 2% target."
" If inflation does not continue to show progress  and there are no suggestions of a significant slowdown in economic activity, then a second 25 -basis -point hike should come sooner rather than later, but that decision is for the future."
