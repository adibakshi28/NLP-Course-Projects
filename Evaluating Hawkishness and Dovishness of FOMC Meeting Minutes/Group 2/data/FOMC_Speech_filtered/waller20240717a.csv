"Waller   Member     Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at  The Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City          Kansas City, Missouri            July 17, 2024    Thank you, Jeff, and thank you to the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City for the opportunity to speak to you today.1  So far, 2024 has been a challenging year  for economic forecasters , and for monetary policymakers."
" After significant progress in 2023 toward the F ederal Open Market Committee’s (F OMC ) pricestability goal, inflation jumped in the first quarter ."
" At the same time , both the labor market and economic growth ran strong enough t hat some commentators wonder ed whether monetary policy was restrictive enough and whether rate hikes should be back on the table."
 These twists and turns in the economic data shifted everyone’s expectations back and forth as to when the FOMC might begin lowering its policy interest rate and how many cuts there would be  this year.
" During this time, my consistent  view was that  there was  no urgency to cut rates until the Committee i s confident  that inflation i s returning sustainably to 2 percent ."
"Then , in the second quarter, data on inflation and the labor market moderated in a way that  suggest s progress toward price stability has resumed ."
" The data over the past couple months shows the economy growing at a more moderate pace, labor supply and demand apparently in balance, and inflation slowing from earlier this year."
" And for monetary policy, i t is even more important to communicate those alter native policy paths to the public so that they can also make plans ."
" So, after reviewing the economic outlook, I will explore  three possible data scenarios about inflation for the second half of 2024 and how those differing scenarios  affect my view of the appropriate stance of policy."
Economic Activity  Let me start with the economic outlook.
" We will get an initial estimate of second -quarter GDP next week, but the Blue Chip average of privatesector forecasts estimates that GDP grew at a - 3 -  1.8 percent pace in the second quarter , and the Atl anta Fed’s GDPNow model  estimates growth at  2.5 percent ."
 I suspect that this moderate consumption growth may continue in the second half of the  year because personal income data is holding up.
  A signal of possible slowing in economic activity comes from the Institute for Supply Management's (ISM) survey of purchasing managers for non -manufacturing firms .
 The index for n ew orders fell especially sharply and the employment index f ell further into contractionary territory.
" Clearly, economic activity among these businesses is slowing, but it is too soon to say by how much."
The Labor Market   One development in the past few months with significant implications for monetary policy is that labor supply and demand have  finally come into rough balance.
" - 4 -  Demand of workers exceeded supply for several years , contribut ing significantly to high wage inflation , which inevitably fed through into services inflation."
" At the same time, the economy grew solidly, and labor demand rose  at a brisk pace."
" Not long ago, I would have been concerned that the high levels of job creation reported recently were inconsistent with a labor market coming in to better balance, but the high pace of immigration in recent quarters help ed accommodate the strong demand."
" And , more recently,  as restrictive monetary policy has put downward pressure on aggregate demand, the demand for labor has moderated."
"  The unemployment rate has risen from a 50year low to 4.1 percen t, still low in historical terms but the highest since late 2021."
" To me, this is all evidence of labor supply and demand in balance."
" - 5 -  Back in 2022, I wrote a research note with Fed economist Andrew Figura on the Beveridge curve, which is the relationship between unemployment and the job vacancy rate.2  In that research, w e projected that, if layoffs were steady, the unemployment rate would rise to around 4.5 percent if the job vacancy rate dropped back to its pre -pandemic level of 4.6 percent."
" There were some prominent skeptics, but th is data tells us that if inflation continues to moderate as it has since May, then  we may achieve the soft landing in the  labor market  that I said back then was possible, with even less of a tradeoff in terms of unemployment."
Another sign of balance in the labor market is that wage growth has continued to slow.
" The threemonth increase through June was running at  an annual pace of 3.6 percent , which is close to what I judge is the rate needed to support inflation running at 2 percent in a sustained way."
 And this interpretation is consistent with other measures that suggest wage growth is back to its pre -pandemic level.
" Right now , the labor market is in a sweet spot —employment growth is not excessive when accounting for immigration, nominal wage growth is near the rate consistent with price stability, the unemployment rate is close to what is thought of as its long run value, the job vacancy rate is near its prepande mic level and the involuntary layoff rate has held steady at 1 percent  for over 2  2 See Andrew Figura and Chris Waller (2022), “What Does the Beveridge Curve Tell Us about the Likelihood of a Soft Landing?” FEDS Notes (Washington:  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, July 29), https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds -notes/what -doesthe-beveridge -curve -tellus-about -thelikelihood -ofa-softlanding -20220729.html ."
"  In terms of the employment leg of the dual mandate, we may well be able to achieve the soft landing."
" As my research note highlighted, the history of the Beveridge curve indicates that , given the normalization of the labor market , a continued decline in the job vacancy rate and the vacancyto-unemployment ratio may lead to a larger increase in unemployment than we have seen the past two years."
" As of today, I see there is more upside risk to unemployment than we have seen for a long time."
 Inflation  Let me now turn to the outlook for inflation.
" This means that  CPI inflation for the 12months through June declined to 3 percent, while the 3month annualized change dropped to 1.1 percent."
" Factoring out energy and food prices, which tend to be volatile, core CPI inflation r ose only 0.1 percent last month, the - 7 -  slowest pace since the pandemic."
 This brings 3month annualize d core inflation down to an annual rate of 2.1 percent .
" Based on the consumer and producer price data reported last week, private sector forecast ers are predicting that the FOMC’s preferred inflation gauge based on personal consumer expenditures (PCE) rose 0.1 percent in June and that core PCE inflation rose 0.2 percent ."
"   So, a fter disappointing data to begin 2024, we now have a couple of months  of data that I view as being  more consistent with the steady progress we saw last year  in reducing inflation, and also consistent with the FOMC’s price stability goal."
 The evidence is mounting that the first quarter inflation data may have been an aberration and that the effects of tighter monetary policy have corralled high inflation.
" To see this, consider the average monthly rate of core PCE inflation over the past 18 months."
 Core PCE inflation jumped to a monthly average of 0.4 percent in the first quarter of this year but is now estimated to be back to 0.2 percent  last quarter .
" Most importantly, I don’t have to look at  the second decimal place to see progress!  The recent data are making me more confident we will achieve the inflation goal of our dual mandate."
 Monetary Policy  Now let me turn to the implications of this data for monetary policy.
"  - 8 -  On the one hand, it is essential that monetary policy get inflation down to a sustained level of 2 percent."
" If we start to loosen policy too soon, and allow inflation to flare up again, we risk losing credibility with the public and allowing expectations of future inflation to become unanchored."
 That credibility has helped inflation fall as quickly as it has in the past 18 months and squandering it would be a grave mistake.
" The other risk is that we wait too long to eas e monetary policy and contribute to  a significant economic slowdown or a recession , with unemployment rising notably."
"  While I believe this is likely,  I will be paying close attention to the employment side of our mandate."
" Here we  continue to receive more  very favorable CPI inflation reports , with implications for very favorable PCE inflation readings as well ."
 This would give us a nice run of inflation data starting in May.
" And, i n that circumstance, I would have much greater confidence in  inflation moving sustainably toward 2 percent ."
" In this case, the inflation data comes in uneven—not as good as the previous few months but - 9 -  still consistent overall with progress on bringing inflation down toward 2 percent."
" Here, with the uneven data, it would be a matter of timing as to when I thought we are making sustainable progress to 2 percent inflation."
" In this case, if we were to see a significant resurgence in inflation in the second half of 2024, it would be tough to conclude  we were making sustainable progress on inflation  this year ."
 These scenarios  highlight that the data will influence how my confidence in inflation returning sustainably to 2 percent could evolve over time .
