"For release on delivery 12:30 p.m. EDT  October 1, 2012         Five Questions about the Federa l Reserve and Monetary Policy    Remarks by  Ben S."
" My topic today is “Five Questions a bout the Federal Reserve and Monetary Policy.”  I have used a questionand-answer format in talks before, and I know from much experience that people are eager to know more about the Federal Reserve, what we do, and why we do it."
" I wa s introduced to one of the team’s star players, but before I could press my questions on some fi ne points of baseball strategy, he asked, “So, what’s the scoop on quantitativ e easing?”  So, for that player, for club members and guests here today, and for anyone else curious  about the Federal Re serve and monetary policy, I will ask and answ er these five questions: 1."
What’s the relationship between the Fe d’s monetary policy and the fiscal decisions of the Administration and the Congress?
What is the risk that the Fed’s accomm odative monetary policy will lead to inflation?
How does the Fed’s monetary policy affect savers and investors?
"As the nation’s central bank, the Federa l Reserve is charged with promoting a healthy economy--broadly speaking, an economy with low unemployment, low and stable inflation, and a financial system th at meets the economy’s needs for credit and other services and that is not itself a sour ce of instability."
 The goals of monetary policy--maximum employment and price stability--are given to  us by the Congress.
" - 3 - In normal circumstances, the Federal Reserve implements monetary policy through its influence on shortterm interest rates,  which in turn affect other interest rates and asset prices.1  Generally, if economic weakness is  the primary concern, the Fed acts to reduce interest rates, which supports th e economy by inducing businesses to invest more in new capital goods and by leading households to spend more on houses, autos, and other goods and services."
" Likewise, if the economy is overhea ting, the Fed can raise interest rates to help cool total demand and constrain inflationary pressures."
"  Following this standard approach, the Fed cut shortterm interest rates rapidly during the financial crisis, reducing them to nearly zero by the end of 2008--a time when the economy was contracting sharply."
" At that point, however, we faced a real challenge:  Once at zero, the shortterm interest rate could not be cut further, so our traditional policy tool for dealing with economic weakness was no longer available."
" Yet, with unemployment soaring, the economy and job ma rket clearly needed more support."
" We asked ourselves, “What do we do now?”  To answer this question, we could dr aw on the experience of  Japan, where shortterm interest rates have been near zero for many years, as well as a good deal of academic work."
" Unable to reduce shortterm interest rates further, we looked instead for ways to influence longerterm interest rates, which remained well above zero."
" We reasoned that, as with traditional monetary policy, bri nging down longerterm rates should support economic growth and employment by loweri ng the cost of borrowing to buy homes and                                                  1 The Fed has a number of ways to influence shortterm  rates; basically, they involve steps to affect the supply, and thus the cost, of shortterm funding."
" Since 2008, we’v e used two types of lesstraditional monetary policy tools to  bring down longerterm rates."
 The Fed’s purchases reduce th e amount of longerterm securities held by investors and put downward pre ssure on the interest rates on  those securities.
 That downward pressure transmits to a wide range  of interest rates that individuals and businesses pay.
" Other impor tant interest rates, such as corporate bond rates and rates on auto loans, have also come down."
" Lower interest rates also put upward pressure on the prices of assets, su ch as stocks and ho mes, providing further impetus to household and business spending."
The second monetary policy tool we have  been using involves communicating our expectations for how long the shortterm inte rest rate will remain  exceptionally low.
" In sum, the Fed’s basic strategy for strengthening the economy--reducing interest rates and easing financial conditions mo re generally--is the same as it has always  - 5 -been."
" The difference is that, with the shortte rm interest rate nearly at zero, we have shifted to tools aimed at reducing long erterm interest rates more directly."
" Last month, my colleagues and I used  both tools--securities purchases and communications about our future actions--in  a coordinated way to further support the recovery and the job market."
" Though the economy has been growing since mid2009 and we expect it to continue to expand, it simply has not been growing fast enough recently to make significant progre ss in bringing down unemployment."
" At 8.1 percent, the unemployment rate is nearly unchanged since the be ginning of the year and is well above normal levels."
" While unemployment has been stubbornly high, our economy has enjoyed broad price stability for some time, and we expect inflation to remain low for the foreseeable future."
 So the case seemed clear to most of my colleagues that we could do more to assist econo mic growth and the job market without compromising our goal of price stability.
" To underline the Federa l Reserve’s commitment to fostering a sustainable economic recovery, we said that we would continue secu rities purchases and employ other policy tools until the outlook for the job market improves substantially in a context of price stability."
" Specifically, we expect that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate fo r a considerable time after the economy strengthens."
"Now, as I have said many times, monetary policy is no panacea."
" It can be used to support stronger economic growth in situations  in which, as today, the economy is not making full use of its resources, and it can fo ster a healthier economy in the longer term by maintaining low and stable inflation."
" Although monetary policy cannot cure the economy’s ills, particularly in today’s chal lenging circumstances, we do think it can provide meaningful help."
       - 7 -What’s the Relationship between Monetary Policy and Fiscal Policy?
  That brings me to the second question:  What’s the relationship between monetary policy and fiscal policy?
" In short, monetary policy and fiscal polic y involve quite differe nt sets of actors, decisions, and tools."
 Borrowing to finance budget deficits increases the government’s total outstanding debt.
"As I have discussed, monetary policy is th e responsibility of the Federal Reserve--or, more specifically, the Federal Open Ma rket Committee, which includes members of the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors a nd presidents of Federal Reserve Banks."
" Unlike fiscal policy, monetary policy does not involve any taxation, tr ansfer payments, or purchases of goods and services."
" Instead, as I mentioned, monetary policy mainly involves the purchase and sale of  securities."
 The securities that the Fed purchases in the conduct of monetary policy are he ld in our portfolio and earn interest.
" The great bulk of these interest earnings is sent to the Tr easury, thereby helping reduce the government deficit."
" So the odds are high that the purchase programs that the Fed has undertaken in support of the recovery will end up reducing, not incr easing, the federal debt, both through the  - 8 -interest earnings we send the Treasury and because a stronger economy tends to lead to higher tax revenues and reduced government spending (on unemployment benefits, for example)."
" Even though our activities are likely to re sult in a lower national debt over the long term, I sometimes hear the complaint that the Federal Reserve is enabling bad fiscal policy by keeping interest rate s very low and thereby making it cheaper for the federal government to borrow."
" Such  an action would substantially increase the deficit, not only because of higher interest rates, but also because the weaker recovery that would result from premature monetary  tightening would fu rther widen the gap between spending and revenues."
 It seems likely that a significant widening of th e deficit--which would make the needed fiscal actions even more difficult and painful--would worsen rather than improve the prospects for a comprehensive fiscal solution.
What Is the Risk that the Federal Re serve’s Monetary Policy Will Lead to Inflation?
"  A third question, and an important one , is whether the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy will lead to higher inflation down the road."
" Inflation has averaged close to 2 percent per year for several decades, and that’s about where it is today."
" In particular, the low interest rate policies the Fed has been following for about five years now have not led to increased inflation."
" Moreover, according to a variety of measures, th e public’s expectations of inflation over the long run rema in quite stable within the range that they have been for many years."
" With monetary policy being so accommodative now, though, it is not unreasonable to ask whether we are sowing the seeds of future inflation."
" A related question I sometimes hear--which bears also  on the relationship between monetary and fiscal policy, is this:  By buying securiti es, are you “monetizing the debt”--printing  - 10 -money for the government to use--and will that inevitably lead to higher inflation?"
" In contrast, we are acquiring Treasury securities on the open market and only on a temporary basis, with the goal of supporting the economic recove ry through lower interest rates."
" For controlling inflation, the key questi on is whether the Federal Reserve has the policy tools to tighten monetary conditions at  the appropriate time so as to prevent the emergence of inflationary pressures down th e road."
" For example, the Fed can tighten policy, even if our balance sheet remains large, by increasing the interest rate we pay banks on reserve balances they deposit at the Fed."
" I can assure  you that my colleagues and I will carefully consider how best to foster both of our mandated objectives, maximum employment and price stability, when the time comes to make these decisions."
How Does the Fed’s Monetary Policy Affect Savers and Investors?
  The concern about possible inflation is a concern about the future.
 One concern in the here and now is about the effect of lo w interest rates on savers  and investors.
" My colleagues and I know that peopl e who rely on investments that  pay a fixed interest rate, such as certificates of deposit, are receiving ve ry low returns, a situ ation that has involved significant hardship for some."
"However, I would encourage you to rememb er that the current low levels of interest rates, while in the first instance a reflection of the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy, are in a larger sense the result of the recent financial crisis, the worst shock to this nation’s financial system since the 1930s."
" The crisis and recession have led to very low intere st rates, it is true, but these events have also destroyed jobs, hamstrung economic growth, and led to sharp declines in the values of many homes and businesses."
" If, in contrast, the Fed were to raise rates now, before the economic recovery is fully entrenched, house prices might resume declines, the values of businesses large and small would drop, and, critically, unemployment would likely star t to rise again."
" In the Federal Reserve Act and subsequent legi slation, the Congress laid out the central bank’s goals and powers, and the Fed is re sponsible to the Congress for meeting its mandated objectives, including fostering maxi mum employment and price stability."
 All of the members of the Federal Open Market Committee take this principle very seriously and strive always to make monetary policy d ecisions based solely on factual evidence and careful analysis.
  One of my principal objectives as Chairm an has been to make monetary policy at the Federal Reserve as transparent as possibl e.
"   While the GAO has access to all aspects of the Fed’s operations and is free to criticize or make recommendations, there is one important exception:  monetary policymaking."
" In the 1970s, the Congress deliberately excluded monetary policy deliberations, decisions, and actions from the scope of GAO reviews."
" In doing so, the Congress carefully balanced the need for democratic accountabili ty with the benefits that flow from keeping monetary policy free from shortterm political pressures."
"However, there have been recent propos als to expand the authority of the GAO over the Federal Reserve to include reviews of  monetary policy decisions."
" Because the  - 15 -GAO is the investigative arm of the Congre ss and GAO reviews may be initiated at the request of members of the Congress, these reviews (or the prospect of reviews) of individual policy decisions coul d be seen, with good reason, as  efforts to bring political pressure to bear on monetary policymakers."
  A perceived politicization of monetary policy would reduce public conf idence in the ability of the Federal Reserve to make its policy decisions based strictly on what is  good for the economy in the longer term.
" Balancing the need for accountability agains t the goal of insulating monetary policy from shortterm political pressure is very importa nt, and I believe that the Congress had it right in the 1970s when it explicitly chose to protect monetary policy decisionmaking from the possibility of politically  motivated reviews."
