" Economic and Monetary Policy Outlook  Before discussing my thoughts  on bank regulatory matters, and in light of our recent Federal Open Market Comm ittee ( FOMC ) meeting, I will begin by sharing my current views on the economy and monetary policy."
" Over the past two years, the FOMC has significantly tightened the stance of monetary policy to address high inflation."
" After seeing considerable progress last year, w e have see n some further progress on lowering inflation in recent months ."
" The 12 -month measures  of total and core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation , which I prefer relative to more volatile higher -frequency readings, have moved down  since April , although they have remained somewhat elevated  and stood  at 2.5 percent and 2.6 percent  in June , respectively ."
" The progress in lowering inflation during  May and June is a welcome development , but inflation is still uncomfortably above the Committee’s 2  percent goal."
"  Despite the recent good data reports , core PCE inflation averaged an annualized 3.4 percent over the first half of the year ."
" - 2 -   normalized , I am not confident that inflation will decline in the same way as in the second half of last year."
" Inflation has hit lower -income households hardest , since food, energy, and housing services price increases far outpaced overall inflation over the past few years ."
Economic activity  moderated in the first half of th is year after increasing at a strong pace last year .
" Gross domestic product (GDP) growth moved  up in the second quarter , following a soft reading  in the first quarter , while private domestic fina l purchases (PDFP)  increase d at a solid pace  in both quarters ."
" During the first half of 2024, PDFP  slowed much  less than GDP , as the slow down in GDP  growth was partly driven by volatile categories such as net exports , suggesting that  underlying economic growth was  stronger than GDP indicated ."
" Unusually strong consumer goods spending  last year  softened in the first quarter  of this year , largely account ing for the step -down in PDFP growth."
" After slow ing in the second quarter, p ayroll employment gains eased  to a more modest pace in July , even as job openings are being filled by the increased immigrant labor supply."
 The latest labor market report shows  that the unemployment rate stood at 4.3 percent  in - 3 -   July.
" Although notably higher than a year ago , this is still a historically low  unemployment rate ."
" We are also seeing a slowing in w age growth , which now stands at  just under 4 percent  as measured by the employment cost index ."
" However, given  trend productivity, wage gains are still above the pace consistent with our inflation goal ."
My baseline outlook is that inflation will  decline further with the current stance of monetary policy.
"  Should the incoming data continu e to show that inflation is moving sustainably toward our 2 percent goal, it will become appropriate to gradually lower the federal funds rate to prevent monetary policy from becoming overly restrictive  on economic activity and employment ."
 But we need to be patient and avoid undermining continued progress on lowering inflation by overreact ing to any single data point .
" Instead, we must view  the data in their totality  as the risks to the Committee’s employment and price -stability mandates continue to move  into better balance ."
" That said , I still see some upside risks to inflation."
" First, as I noted earlier, much of the progress on inflation last year was due to supply -side improvements, including easing of supply chain constraints; increases in the number of available workers, due both to increased labor force participation and strong immigration; and lower energy prices."
"  It is unlikely that further improvements along this margin will continue to lower inflation going forward, as supply chains have largely normalized, the labor force participation rate has leveled off in recent mont hs below pre -pandemic levels , and  significantly higher  U.S. immigration over the past few years may decrease going forward ."
" Geopolitical developments could also pose upside risks to inflation, as the recent surge in container shipping costs originating in  Asia suggest that global supply chains  remain susceptible to disruptions, which could  put upward pressure on food, energy, and commodity prices."
" There - 4 -   is also the risk that additional fiscal stimulus  could add momentum to demand, impeding  further progress on reducing inflation."
" Finally, there continues to be a risk that the increased immigration could lead to persistently high housing services inflation."
" There are also risks that the labor market has not be en as strong as the payroll data have been indicating , but it also appears  that the recent rise in unemployment may be exaggerat ing the degree of cooling in labor markets ."
" The  Q4 Q uarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) report implies that job gains have been consistently overstated in the establishment survey since March of last year , while  the household survey unemployment data ha ve become less accurate as response rates have appreciably decline d since the pandemic .2  Moreover, t he rise in the unemployment rate this year largely reflect s weaker hiring , as job searchers entering the labor force are taking longer to find a job , while layoffs remain low."
  It is also likely that  some temporary factors contributed  to the soft July employment report.
" The rise in the unemployment rate in July was centered in workers experiencing a temporary layoff, who are more likely to be rehired in coming months, and  Hurricane Beryl likely contributed to weaker job gains, as the number of workers not working due to bad weather increa sed significantly last month ."
" 2 The Q4 Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages ( QCEW ) administrative data show employment gains that are about 110,000 per month lower than what the Current Employment Statistics ( CES) survey reported from March 2023 to December 2023."
" Although the Bureau of Labor Statistics  benchmarks CES payroll employment based on the Q1 QCEW, to be released on August 21, the Q4 QCEW data point to a substantial downward revision to CES employment gains last year."
" - 5 -   In light of upside risks  to inflation  and uncertainty regarding labor market conditions and the economic outlook, I will continue to watch the data closely as I assess the appropriate path of monetary policy."
  It is important to note that monetary policy is not on a preset course.
"  In my view, we should consider a range of possible scenarios that could unfold when assessing  how the FOMC ’s monetary policy decisions may evolve."
"  My colleagues and I will make our decisions at each FOMC meeting based on the incoming data and the implications for and risks to the outlook , with a focus on the dual -mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices."
" By the time of our September meeting, we will have seen a range of additional economic data and information , including one employment and t wo inflation reports ."
  I will continue to closely monitor th e data and visit with a broad range of contacts as I assess economic conditions and the appropriateness of our monetary policy stance .
" As I noted  earlier, I continue to view  inflation as somewhat elevated ."
" And w ith some upside risks to inflation, I still see the need to pay close attention to the price -stability side of our mandate while watch ing for risks of a material weakening  in the labor market."
 My view continue s to be  that restoring price stability is essential f or achieving maximum employment over the longer run.
 Strong bank culture demand s accountability  for bank leadership teams  and for the entire workforce.
"  While banks are free to pursue growth, in some instances this growth has come without accompanying development of and investment in risk management and legal compliance, to the detriment of the bank and its customers."
"   In the case of Silicon Valley Bank ’s (SVB)  failure  in 2023, rapid growth was certainly a factor that contributed to the firm’s fragility ."
" The bank’s management failed to properly manage its development of contingent liquidity planning, funding, and risk -management capabilities  in light of its rapid  growth ."
" While this failure revealed  problems with bank leadership  in promoting a compliance and risk -management culture commensurate with growth , supervis ors directly overseeing the bank’s expansion  were also late to act in the face of emerging firm risks."
 We know that r apid growth is a known risk factor that should result in additional  supervisory scrutiny.
" But s ome of the postfailure SVB review s conducted internally by Federal Reserve staff  cited  rapid growth  as a contributing factor for the inadequacy of the supervisory approach .4  Among other things, the se internal  reports suggested that the shift of SVB from one supervisory portfolio to another somehow frustrated appropriate supervision."
   - 9 -   whether supervisors a re empowered to appropriately supervise firms that experience rapid growth  and other emerging risks .
 Banks of all sizes may choose to pursue M&A to pursue strategic growth opportunities and to remain competitive with larger peers that can achieve growth organically through sheer scale.
" The consequence of limiting the growth options for any bank hoping to compete with the largest G -SIBs has the perverse, and unintended , consequence of actually further insulating the very largest institutions from competition."
" The demands of the process act as a self -selection mechanism, with only institutions that see both value in the transaction and a strong likelihood of regulatory approval going through the process."
"  Just as a bank’s rapid growth may increase the risks of outgrowing risk -management and compliance frameworks, rapid  regulatory  reforms  increase the risk of regulation resulting in  harmful unintended consequences to the banking and financial system."
