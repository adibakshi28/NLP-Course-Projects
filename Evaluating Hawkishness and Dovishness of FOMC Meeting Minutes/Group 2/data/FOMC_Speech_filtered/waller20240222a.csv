"Waller   Member     Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at the   Finding Forward Speaker Series  University of St. Thomas  Opus College of Business         Minneapolis, MN           February 22, 2024   Thank you, Dean Dunham  and the University of St. Thomas for the opportunity to speak to you today.1  Given that this event is co -sponsored by the Notre Dame Club of Minnesota , and  I taught at Notre Dame for 13 years , I will l ead off with this thought:   Go Irish!  When I last spoke on January 16, the data we had received up to that point was very good —three - and sixmonth measures of core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation w ere running right at 2  percent,  which is our goal  for total inflation , the labor market was cooling but still healthy , and real gross domestic product ( GDP ) was likewise growing but expected to moderate in the fourth quarter."
" I argued then that the data was “almost as good as it gets .”  And I argued that because the economy was doi ng so well, we could take our time and collect more data to ensure that inflation was on a sustainable 2  percent  path."
"Since then,  we received data on fourth quarter GDP as well as January data on job growth  and consumer product  index (CPI) inflation."
" GDP growth came in at 3.3  percent , well above forecasts."
" Jobs grew by  353,000, well over forecasts of less than 200,000 , and monthly core CPI inflation came in at 0.4  percent , which was much higher than it ha d been  for the p revious  six months."
"  So, the data that we have received since my last speech has reinforced my view  that we need to verify that t he progress on inflation we saw in the last half of 2023 will continue and this means there is no rush to begin cutting interest rates to normalize monetary policy."
  - 2 - Last week’s report on consumer prices in January was a reminder that ongoing progress on inflation is not assured .
 The uptick in inflation in that report  was spread widely among goods and services .
" This o ne month of data may have been driven by some odd seasonal factors or outsized increases in housing costs , or it may be a signal that inflation is stickier than we thought and will be harder to bring back down to our target ."
" While I believe inflation is likely on track to reach 2  percent in a sustainable manner, I am going to need to see more data  to sort out whether January ’s CPI inflation was more noise than signal."
 This means waiting longer  before I have enough confidence  that beginning to cut rates will keep us on a path to 2 percent inflation.
"  Fortunately, the strength of output and employment growth means that there is no great urgency in easing policy , which I still expect we will do this year ."
" More data, and more time, will tell whether January ’s CPI report was just a bump in the road to 2 percent  inflation ."
"  And, with most data indica ting solid economic fundamentals , the risk of wait ing a little longer to ease policy is lower  than the risk of acting too soon  and possibly halting or reversing the progress we’ve made on inflation."
"   Let me start with the outlook for economic activity, including what we have learned from the latest data."
" As I mentioned , real GDP grew strongly in the second half of 2023 and that momentum has led forecasters to predict continued solid growth in the first months of 2024 ."
" For nonmanufactur ing businesses , the index increased to a level consistent with moderate growth."
" Meanwhile , the manufacturing index , while still contractionary,  rose to its highest level since October 2022 , with rising orders and production, continued improvement in delivery times, and inventory positions among customers all pointing to favorable growth in demand."
"  While the balance of the evidence is that growth has continued at a moderate rate, several  indicators suggest some slowing."
 It may indicat e that consumer spending which  ran higher than I expected in the second half of 2023 is finally showing the effects of higher interest rates  and a depletion of excess savings .
" As I mentioned, t he U.S. economy created 353,000 jobs in January, and 333,000 in December, well above the 255,000 a month average in 2023  and also well above what most estimate to  be consistent with population growth."
  Job growth in January was widespread across different sectors of the ec onomy.
" But there were also significant job increases in parts of the economy  - 4 - that tend to rise and fall with changes in the pace of economic activity —manufacturing, construction, retail trade and professional business services."
"    Unemployment was steady at 3.7 percent, nearly as low as it has been in 50 years."
" And while there were signs of slackening demand for labor over the course of 2023, those signs haven’t been so  clear  recently."
 The 12 -month growth rate in average hourly earnings fell from 4.7 percent in July to 4.3 percent in December and then rose to 4.5 percent in January.
 I have been focused on the number of job openings for the past two years as an indicator of labor demand.
" One data point does not make a trend, and th ese strong job reports come after a year of more or less steady loosening in the labor market, with supply increasing relative to demand."
 But it does tend to support the idea of continued moderate growth in economic activit y.
 Everything about the outlook that I have mentioned so far is important for what it tells us about continued progress toward the Federal Open Market Committee’s ( FOMC ) 2 percent inflation goal.
" Last week’s high reading o n CPI inflation may just be a bump in the road, but it also may be a warning that the considerable progress on inflation over the past year may be stalling."
" While 12 -month CPI inflation improved a bit to 3.1 percent, it was higher than expected, as was the 3.9 percent rise in core inflation  that excludes   - 5 - volatile food and energy prices."
" The FOMC’s preferred inflation gauge, based on personal consumption expenditures, isn’t out yet  for January , but an estimate factoring in producer prices  is that core PCE inflation rose to a 12 -month rate of 2.8 percent , and three - and sixmonth rates rose to  2.4 percent and 2.5 percent respectively ."
" A year ago , core CPI inflation was 6.4 percent and core P CE inflation was 4.9 percent."
" Inflation has fallen by more than half  since then , and the progress continued all the way through December."
" Also, there was good news in the annual seasonal adjustment factors this month to the past year of inflation data."
" In early 2023, these revisions had revealed that inflation in 2022 was a lot worse than initial estimates, and I was worried this would happen again  this year."
 But the revisions on February 9 did not change the picture of a dramatic improvement in inflation in 2023.
" In judging whether January inflation was noise  or a sign of slowing progress, one thing I will be looking at are measures of wages and compensation."
 And the Atlanta Fed’s Wage Growth Tracker continued its very gradual decline in January.
" Payroll costs are the largest expense for most  - 6 - businesses, and I will be watching to see whether wages and other compensation continue to moderate or if they become a factor preventing progress toward  our inflation  goal."
"While I focus on the overall inflation numbers, it is still useful to  look how the different components of inflation have moved ."
 A big factor in the improvement of inflation over the past year has come from goods prices  which fell during 2023.
 Goods prices represent almost 25 percent of core CPI inflation.
" Even at times of very low inflation, goods deflation is modest in a growing economy, so one question is whether this contribution to progress on inflation will continue."
" Another big contributor to CPI inflation is the cost of h ousing services,  which measures  the estimated costs of renting or the equivalent for owning a home ."
 Housing cost inflation represents about 45 percent of core CPI inflation.
" There was a fairly steady moderation in housing services inflation in 2023, as the slowing in market rent  increase s since 2022 began to gradually show through to the housing services price index ."
 But we saw an unexpected jump in housing services inflation in the January CPI data .
The remaining component of core CPI inflation  is services excluding housing.
  Inflation in this category moderated over the course of 2023 but  in January there was a broad -based increase.
" So, one question is whether relatively elevated labor costs prevent moderation in this large component  of inflation."
"  - 7 - As I consider all these aspects  of inflation, I have to say that I see predominately upside risks to my general expectation that inflation will continue to move toward the FOMC’s 2 percent goal."
" On the flip side, I see little reason to expect that inflation will run below 2  percent  for an extended period given the strong economic fundamentals we are observing  in GDP and employment ."
" For th ese reason s, I am going to need to see a couple more months of inflation data to be sure that January was a fluke and that we are still on track to price stability."
 This brings me to the implications of this outlook for monetary policy.
" Sifting through the data, I see evidence of ongoing robust growth in output and employment, but also some signs that growth may be slowing."
" This is a good outcome,  and our job is not to stop it but rather to ensure that economic fundamentals grow in a manner consistent with inflation at 2  percent ."
 I am going to need to see at least another couple more months of inflation data before I can judge whether January was a speed bump or a pothole.
" I will be watching wages and compensation, and the components of inflation that I outlined today to see whether broad progress on inflation continues or stalls."
" I will also be monitoring  - 8 - economic activit y and employment, attentive as always to any unexpected warning signs of a recession, but also paying close attention to whether growth in each is consistent with continued progress toward 2 percent inflation."
" I still expect it will be appropriate sometime this year to begin easing monetary policy, but the start of policy easing and number of rate cuts  will depend on the incoming  data."
" I likewise don’t know whether the economy and employment will continue to barrel ahead, or whether both will slow in a manner that I expect will support  progress toward 2 percent inflation ."
" When rates are going up, most of the discussion is on the long and variable lags of monetary policy with rate hikes not having a serious impact on the economy for 18 months or more."
 But it is very difficult to untangle the effects of tight monetary policy from a  - 9 - major economic shock when looking at past U.S. recessions.
"  And, I think I have shown that acting too soon could squander our progress in inflation and risk considerable harm to the economy."
"  In conclusion, the strength of the economy and the recent data we have received on inflation mean it is appropriate  to be patient, careful, methodical, deliberative  – pick your favorite  synonym ."
