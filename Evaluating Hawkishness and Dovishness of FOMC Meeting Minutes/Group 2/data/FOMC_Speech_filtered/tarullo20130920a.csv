" One example, of particular interest to central bankers, is the ongoing debate about the circumstanc es under which monetary policy should be adjusted to take account of financial stability concerns."
"  Progress in these debates is complicated by the fact that, by definition, financial stability policies are directed toward preventing or mitigat ing rare  events, rather than outcomes such as inflation and unemployment that are co ntinuously observable."
"2 For a recent study finding a correlation between the growth of credit aggregates and financial crises, and also suggesting a secular trend making such crises more of a risk, see Moritz Schularick and Alan M."

" And, again foreshadowing many recent discussions, he suggested macroprudential tools both to increase resiliency (as through capital regulation with a systemic perspective) a nd to lean against the wind in an effort to slow or limit the growth of unsustainable asset bubbles (as through maximum loan -tovalue ratio requirements)."
" The approach we are instead taking is that, under such conditions, our severely adv erse scenario would assume a level of unemployment during the stress period comparable to that observed in past severe recessions, not simply an increase in unemployment comparable to the increase observed during those recessions.12  Thus, the scenario’s un employment rate would feature a larger and sharper rise in the unemployment rate as economic expansions proceed."
" For that reason, we modified the market shock scenario in 2011 to take account of Eurozone stress and then further modified the hypothesized st ress in 2012 to include sharp moves in interest rates."
" If, on the other hand, the measures are designed to be fairly broad -based, the more basic question of the appropriate role  of monetary policy may be raised by  those who are focused on reactive policies that “get in all the cracks” of the financial system, not just the heavily regulated portion occupied  by large financial firms."
" For time invariant measures to bear this burden, it might be necessary to have through -thecycle constraints that strengthen finan cial stability at greater  cost t o economic activity."
" If a central bank is reluctant ever  to use monetary policy in pursuit of financial stability goals at the expense of more immediate emplo yment and price stability goals, the burden on time invariant measures would be large indeed."
" Even if financial stability objectives are effectively  - 17 - incorporated into monetary policy, monetary tightening will surely no t be the correct response to most  instances of increasing leverage or asset prices that raise macropru dential concerns."
 Well -developed  timevarying measures might be  effective in slowing the increase in systemic risk to give monetary policymakers more time to evaluate the need for a monetary policy response.
" This provision envisions an increase in the applicable risk -weighted capital requirements of financial companies by up to 2½ percentage points when “credit growth is excessive and is leading to the buildup of system -wide risk.”18  While stress testing has a built -in degree of time -variance (since macroeconomic scenarios must be constructed annually), the countercyclical buffer is intended to b e purely time variant, in that it is to be activated when, and only when, there is “excess aggregated credit growth,” a condition that the Basel Committee anticipates will occur only infrequently.19   The principal macroprudential rationale of the countercyclical buffer is one of increasing resiliency : that t he banking system as a whole will have enough capital to continue effective intermediation, even if a period of stress follows what turned out to be a period of unsustainable, rapid credit growth that leads to unusually hi gh losses as asset prices plummet thereafter.20  The Basel Committee also noted that there could  be a                                                  18 Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (2011) , “Basel III: A Global Regulatory Framework for More Resilient Banks and Banking Systems, ” (Basel, Switzerland: Bank for International Settlements, June), p."
" As I have argued elsewhere, one or more such measures should be the highest priority in f illing out reform agendas directed both at the largest  institutions and at systemic risk more generally.25 One reason I place a high priority on initiatives  to address the vulnerability created by short -term wholesale funding is that t he development of thes e and other structural  measures does not depend so heavily on identifying  when credit growth or asset prices in one or more sectors of the economy have become unsustainable."
