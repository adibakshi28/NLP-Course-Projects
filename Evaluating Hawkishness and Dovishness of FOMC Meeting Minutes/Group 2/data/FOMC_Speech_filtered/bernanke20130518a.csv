" In particular, I will be looking beyond the very real challenges of economic recovery that we face today--challenges that I have every confidence we will overcome--to speak, for a change, about economic growth as measured in decades, not months or quarters."
" The first wave drove the growth of the early industrial era, which lasted from the mid1700s to the mid1800s."
" These i nnovations, by introducing mechanization, specialization, and mass produc tion, fundamentally changed how and where goods were produced and, in the process, greatly increa sed the productivity of workers and reduced the cost of basic consumer goods."
" Indeed, according to the best available data, output per person in the United States increased by approximately 30 times between 1700 and 1970 or so, growth that has resulted in multiple transformations of our economy and society.1  History suggests that economic prospects during the coming decades depend on whether the most recent revolution, the IT revolution, has economic effects of similar scale and scope as the previous two."
" Indeed, some knowl edgeable observers have recently made the case that the IT revolut ion, as important as it surely is, likely will not generate the transformative economic effects that flowed  from the earlier technological revolutions.2  As a result, these observers argue, economic growth and change in coming decades likely will be noticeably slower than the pace to which Americans have become accustomed."
"Gordon (2010, 2012); the latter reference, in particular, also contains a discussion of headwinds to growth beyond the prospects for innovation."

" Extrapolating to the future, the conclusion some have drawn is that the sustainable pace of economic growth and change and the associated improvement in living standards will likely slow further, as our most recent technological revolution, in computers and IT, will not transf orm our lives as dramatically as previous revolutions have."
" By the way, Keynes argued at that time that such a view was shortsighted and, in characterizing what he called “the economic possibiliti es for our grandchildren,” he  predicted that income per person, adjusted for inflation, could rise as much as four to eight times by 2030."
