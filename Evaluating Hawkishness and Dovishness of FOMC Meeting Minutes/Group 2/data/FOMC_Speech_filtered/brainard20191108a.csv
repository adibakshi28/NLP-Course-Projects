"PST)  November 8, 2019         Why Climate Change Matters for Monetary Policy and Financial Stability    Remarks by  Lael Brainard   Member   Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at  “The Economics of Climate Change ”  a research conference sponsored by  the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco   San Francisco, California         November 8, 2019   I want to thank my colleagues at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, especially Mary Daly, Galina Hale, Òscar Jordà, and Glenn Rudebusch, for organizing this research conference.1  The presentations today provide important insights into the many important ways climate -related risks may affect our financial system and broader economy.2  Similar to many areas around the country, we need not look far from here to see the potentially devastating effects of our changing climate."
" Congress has assigned the Federal Reserve specific responsibilities in monetary policy, financial stability, financial regulation and supervision, community and consumer affairs, and payments."
 Climate Change and Monetary Policy  Let’s start with monetary policy.
" Increasingly, it will be important for the Federal Reserve to take into account the effects of climate change and associated policies in setting monetary policy to achieve our objective s of maximum employment and price stability."
" Monetary policy seeks to buffer the economy from unexpected adverse disruptions, or “shocks.”   It is generally more challenging for monetary policy to insulate the economy from shocks to the supply side of the economy than to the demand side."
" So it is vital for monetary policymakers to understand the nature of climate disturbances to                                                  6 See U.S. Global Change Research Program (2018), Fourth National Climate Assessment:  Volume II:   Impacts, Risks, and Adaptation in the United States  (Washington:  USGCRP), https://nca2018.globalchange.gov ."
"  For instance, monetary policymakers must accurately assess how disasters such as hurricanes, wildfires, and flooding affect labor markets, household and business spending, output, and prices.7  In deciding whether to alter monetary policy or , instead , to “look through” such shocks, polic ymakers need to assess the likely persistence of the effects and how widespread they are."
" Because there is considerable uncertainty about the persistence, breadth, and magnitude of climate -related shocks to the economy, it could be challenging to assess w hat adjustments to monetary policy are likely to be most effective at keeping the economy operating at potential with maximum employment and price stability.8  We need only look back to the oil price shocks of the 1970s and 1980s to see how difficult it wa s for monetary policymakers to assess accurately the likely persistence of the effects on inflation and output and the appropriate response."
"To the extent that climate change and the associated policy responses affect productivity and longrun economic growth, there may be implications for the longrun neutral level of the real interest rate , which is a  key consideration in monetary policy."

" - 4 - on output and labor productivity.9  A shifting energy landscape, rising insurance premiums, and increasing spending on climate change adaptations —such as air conditioning a nd elevating homes out of floodpla ins—will have implications for economic activity and inflation."
"  As pol icies are implemented to mitigate climate change, they will affect prices, productivity, employment, and output in ways that could have implications for monetary policy."
" Just  on its own, the large amount of uncertainty regarding climate -related events and policies could hold back investment and economic activity.10   Climate Change and Financial Stability  Second, the Federal Reserve will need to assess the financial system for vulnerabilities to important climate risks ."
"  Similar to other significant risks, such as cyber attacks,  we want our financial system to be resilient to the effects of climate change.11 Although there is substantial uncertainty surrounding how or when shifts in asset valuations might occur, we can begin to identify the factors that could propagate losses                                                  9 Riccardo Colacito, Bridget Hoffman, and Toan Phan (2018), “Temperature and Growth:  A Panel Analysis of the United States .” Working Paper 18 -09 (Richmond, VA:  Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, March), https://www.richmondfed.org/p ublications/research/working_papers/2018/wp_1809."
" The associated declines in wealth could amplify the effects on economic activity, which could have further knockon effects on financial markets."
" We expect banks to have systems in place that appropriately identify, measure, control, and monitor all of their material risks.13  These risks may include severe weather events that can disrupt standard clearing and sett lement activity and increase the demand for cash."

" As we have seen today, researchers are making progress on addressing questions regarding how  climate change relat es to labor markets, trade  policy, and monetary policy."
