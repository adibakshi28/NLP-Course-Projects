 Payroll employment declined by almost 9 million ; over 7 million people lost their homes.3  Many young people entered  a terrible job market; research shows that this may adversely affect their careers for many years .
" Employment is now almost 7 million jobs higher than its pre -crisis peak, with all of the  net gains coming from the private sector."
" And  with unemployment at 4.5 percent,  we are at or close to full employment."
" Although job growth has been strong, gross domestic product has increased only about 2 percent annually since the crisis , held down by the weakest sustained period of  labor productivity growth since W orld War II."
" Labor productivity --the increase in output per hour --has increased only Â½ percent per year since 2011, about a quarter of its post -war average."
 The productivity slowdown has profound implications for our national well -being.
  We need a national focus on increasing the sustainable growth rate of our economy.5  That means invest ing in our workforce to give them the skills and aptitudes they need to compete in the global economy .
" And about 75 percent  of interest rate and credit default swaps  are now centrally cleared, which allows for greater transparency and more consistent risk management.6  While the move to central clearing has made the system safer, we need to make sure that the central counterparties  have the resources and riskmanagement practices to withstand plausible but severe shocks.7 Many of the statutory provisions and regulations put in place to effect these changes were novel ; it is not likely that we would have gotten  everything exactly right on the first attempt."
" For example, w e need to allow boards of directors and management to spend a smaller portion of their time on  technical  compliance exercises  and more time focusing on the activities that support sustainable economic growth."
"  I am sure that there are o ther areas where laws, re gulations , and supervisory practices could be adjusted in a way that preserves the gains in safety and soundness but helps financial institutions devote as much of their resources as possible to supporting economic growth."
