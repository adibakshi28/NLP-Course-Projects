  Monetary policy itself shows the value of participation and transparency.
U.S. monetary policy is the sole responsibility of the Federal Reserve.
"Since 1935, we have decided monetary policy by committee, a structure that has served us well because it is designed to capture different views of a wide and varied national econ omy."
"And over the past several decades, the FOMC has greatly increased its own transparency --from postmeeting announcements, to announcing an objective for inflation, to a published survey of economic projections, to postmeeting press conferences (which will now take place after every FOMC meeting).6 As many of you know, over the course of 2019, we will be reviewing our monetary policy strategy, tools, and communication practices, and we  will hold a research conference on the subject with outside speakers , as well as  “Fed Listens” events at a number of Reserve Banks , to hear from a broad range of constituencies ."
"6 The FOMC’s “Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy,” first issued in January 2012 and reaffirmed each January , specifies that the Committee judg es that inflation at the rate of 2 percent, as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, is most consistent over the longer run with the Federal Reserve’s statutory mandate and that the Committee would be concerned if inflation wer e running persistently above or below this objective."
"Just in the past several days, the Board acted to suspend stress te sts this year for lower -risk firms --generally, those with total assets between $100 billion and $250 billion.7 That move follows the passage of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act.8 The extended cycle provides administrative  burden relief for these institutions and recognizes the different risks that they typically pose --especially compared to the largest and most complex firms, whose failure poses the greatest risk to the real economy."

"More broadly, t he core of the Federal Reserve’s  independence is a broad consensus                                                            9 Changes proposed as part of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act have been proposed but not finalized."
