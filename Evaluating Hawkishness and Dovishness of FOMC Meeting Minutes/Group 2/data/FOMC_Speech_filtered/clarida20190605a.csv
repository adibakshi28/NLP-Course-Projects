"Clarida   Vice Chair   Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at the   Conference on Monetary Policy Strategy, Tools, and Communication Practices  (A Fed Listens  Event)  Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago   Chicago, Illinois         June 5, 2019    Good morning, and welcome to day two of the Federal Reserve System  Conference on Monetary Policy Strategy, Tools, and Communication Practices.1  I think you will have to agree that the presentations and discussion yesterday were uniformly thoughtful, substantive, and stimulating, and today we will have another impressive lineup of speakers and panelists addressing timely topics that are relevant to our review."
"Yesterday Professors Eberly, Stock, and Wright provided us with a thorough and thought ful evaluation of the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy strategy, tools, and communications since 2009."
" They conclude that the policy tools that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) relied on —“level policy” and “slope policy,” to use the ir terminology —helped restore the U.S. economy to health and bring it close to the  statutory goals of maximum employment and price stability  assigned to us by the Congress."
" As was noted several times yesterday, in recent years forecasters and policymakers have been surp rised by the decline in the unemployment rate and the size of the sustained ongoing gains in payroll employment."
 FOMC participants’ estimates of the longer -run normal rate of unemployment in the Summary of Economic Projections illustrate this point—they h ave drifted lower over time as labor market conditions have                                                  1 The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of other Federal Reserve Board members or Federal Open Market Committee participants.
  - 2 - improved and inflation has remained quiescent.2  The paper by Professors Abraham and Haltiwanger provided us with an innovative  search -andmatching model to estimate labor market slack —which  compl ements the standard estimates based on unemployment gaps and Phillips curve relationships.
 Professor Obstfeld’s paper examined the ways that global economic integration affects inflation and the neutral rate of interest —or r* —and the role played by the U.S. dollar in transmitting the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy to other countries.
"Our p rogram t oday  will feature papers by Lars Svensson  on alternative monetary policy strategies, by Eric Sims and Cynthia Wu on the policy tool kit, and by Anil Kashyap and Caspar Siegert on the interplay between financial stability considerations                                                  2 In January 2009, when longer -run projections were added to the Summary of Economic Projections, the midpoint of the central tendency for the longer -run normal unemployment rate was 4.9 percent."
" In March 2019, the median of the longer -run normal unemployment rate was 4.3 percent."
  - 3 - and monetary policy.
"Aside fro m being an intellectually stimulating two days, how does this week’s conference fit into the FOMC’s review of its monetary policy strategy, tools, and communications?"
" In Minneapolis, we listened to researchers discuss the distributional consequences of the economic cycle and of monetary policy ."
" In Richmond, a panel of local  business and community leaders discuss ed the ways  the Fed’s monetary policy  affect s the regi onal economy ."
"  - 4 - In coming regularly scheduled meetings, the FOMC will undertake its assessment of our monetary policy strategy, tools, and communication practices."
