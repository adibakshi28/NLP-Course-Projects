" Whatever one’s view on that question, the confluence of some apparently  secular trends raises important questions about our nation’s future growth potential and our ability to provide opportunity for all of our  people ."
Productivity growth has slowed.
"  After detailing these trends,  I will turn briefly to both the role and the limits of monetary policy in countering them .1 Structural Challenges for the American Economy  Lagging productivity growth  Over the long term, the pace at which our standard s of living increase  depends on the growth of labor productivity --that is, the increase in the amount of economic value that a worker can generate during each hour on the job."
" Unfortunately, the data on productivity growth in recent years have been disappointing."
" Although output per hour in the nonfar m business sector rose about 23/4 percent per year from the end of World War II through 1971, productivity has risen just 1 -1/2 percent per year since then , excluding a brief burst of rapid growth that occurred roughly between 1996 and  2004."
"  Just as it took economists a long time to identify the sources of th e surge in productivity that began nearly two  decades ago, they are only now beginning to grapple with the more  recent slowdown."
" Some have argued that the burst of productivity growth that began in the mid1990s was the anomaly , and that the more pedestri an pace of growth over the past decade represents a return to the norm.2  In this view, the long period of rapid productivity growth that ended in the 1970s grew out of the technological                                                  1 Stephanie Aaronson of the Board’s staff contributed substantially to these remarks."

" In particular , these authors  argue that the information technology revolution of the past several decades --including the diffusion of computers , the devel opment of the Internet , and improvements in telecommunications --is unlikely to generate the productivity gains prompted by earlier innovations such as electrification and mass production."
" While productivity has increased less rapidly in recent years than during the first three -fourth s of the 20th  century, per capita income (a statistic available over a longer time  span) is still rising more quickly than it was even during the second Industrial Revolution."
" Indeed, some have argued that the problem with new technology is not with productivity growth but with our ability to capture the productivity in our statistics."
" Moreover, many economists and technophiles remain optimistic that we have yet to fully realize the potential of the information revolution , and that technological change will continue to bring inventions and productivity enhancements  that we can not imagine today.3  This view holds that there is no reason productivity  could not continue to rise in line with its lon gterm historical average.4                                                    3 See, for example, Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee (2011), Race Against  the Machine :  How the Digital Revolution Is Accelerating Innovation, Driving Productivity, and Irreversibly Transforming Employment and the Economy  (Lexington, Mass .:  Digital Frontier Press); Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee (2014), The Second Machine Age:  Work, Progress, and Prosperity in a Time of Brilliant Technologies  (New York:  W.W.

" - 4 - It must be noted that , even among the productivity optimists, there are differences over how the expected progress will affect job creation and income distribution."
" In particula r, some in this camp believe that we are likely to see a continuation of the pattern by which recent productivity growth seems to have mostly benefited relatively skilled workers."
" It may also have favored returns to capital investment, as opposed to labor , in greater proportion than past productivity gains."
"  While there is some reason for optimism about the prospects for technological progress, there are grounds for concern over the decline in the dynamism of the U.S. labor market , an attribute that has c ontributed to productivity growth in the past and has traditionally distinguished the United States from many other advanced economies ."
 C reative destruction has been shown to improve productivity  as jobs that have low productivity are replaced with jobs that yield greater productivity.6                                                  5 Joseph A.

" To give an example, the rate of cross -state migration was less t han half as large in 2011 as its average over the period from 1948 to 1971.7  And , while we still see the level of employment rising and falling over the business cycle, the gross flows of people between jobs and of jobs across firms that underlie the obse rved aggregate changes have fallen over the past 15 years."

"  - 6 - both cases, workers and firms are able to achieve a good outcome with less turnover and presumably no loss of productivity ."
"  For instance, an increase in the costs to firms of hiring and firing individuals or an increase in the costs to individuals of changing jobs could lea d to fewer productivity -enhancing job changes."
" Alternatively, the reduction in churning could itself be a function of slower productivity growth, as slower productivity growth implies lower benefits to forming new matches."
" And on that point , we find that households in the middle and lower parts of the earnings distribution have experienced , at best , only modest improvements in inflationadjusted income.10  Between 1979 and 2007, households in the middle quintile of the income distribution--a functional definition of the middle class --saw their real labor income (adjusted for household size) rise only about 3 percent."
" T here have been healthy gains in employment in highly  paid occupations , such as computer and information systems managers , and a rise in low -paid jobs , such as home health -care workers, but g rowth has been much slower in occupations with earnings in the middle of the distribution, such as machinists."
" For example, food services, retail, and employment services, all low -wage industries, accounted for nearly 45 percent of net employment growth from the start of the recovery through early 2012, while employment in a number of industries that offer good jobs for midwage workers --including construction, manufacturing, and finance, insurance, and real estate--did not grow in those years or grew too slowly to make up for their job losses during the recession.11   There is no single explanation for the rise in inequality and the decline in the share of jobs that provide a middle -class standard of living."
" Economists generally agree that technological change and globalization have played a role.12  Both of these forces have reduced the demand for workers whose jobs had involved routine work that can easily be mechanized or of fshored while , at the same time , increasing the productivity of higher -skilled workers ."
" It may be that by increasing the effective size of the markets for their skills, technological change and glo balization can also explain some of                                                   11 For more information on this trend, s ee National Employment Law Project (2012), “The Low -Wage Recovery and Growing Inequality,” data brief (New York:  NELP, August), www.nelp.org/page/ -/Job_Creation/LowWageRecovery2012.pdf?nocdn=1."
" - 11 - The Role of Monetary Policy  As must be apparent, the challenges I have discussed are not susceptible to easy or rapid solution."
" It is equally apparent that monetary policy cannot be the only, or even the principal, tool in addressing these challenges."
 Monet ary policies directed toward achieving the statutory dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability can help reduce underemployment associated with low aggregate demand.
" And, to the degree that monetary policy can prevent cyclical phenomena such a s high unemployment and low investment from becoming entrenched, it might be able to improve somewhat the potential growth rate of the economy over the medium term.15   More generally, reducing labor market slack can help lay the foundation for a more susta ined, self -reinforcing cycle of stronger aggregate demand, increased production, renewed investment, and productivity gains."
" The very accommodative monetary policy of the p ast five years has contributed significantly to the extended, moderate recoveries of gross domestic product ( GDP ) and employment."
" To be sure, there have been notable wage increases in specific areas of the country enjoying economic growth much higher than the national average."
" And, as is                                                  15 For details on the potential growth rate of the economy, s ee Dave Reifschneider, William Wascher, and David Wilcox (2013), “Aggregate Supply in the United States:  Recent Developments and Implications for the Conduct of Monetary Policy,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2013 -77 (Washington:  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, November), www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2013/201377/201377abs.html."
 The reasons for the lag in wage gains in the context of continuing moderate growth are not totally clear.
"  There is, of course, also a debate around the question of how much of current unemployment --particularly long -term unemployment--is structural and thus how much slack still exists in labor markets."
" We should remain attentive to evidence that labor markets have actually tightened to the point that there is demonstrable inflationary pressure that would pl ace at risk maintenance of the FOMC’s stated inflation target (which, of course, we are currently not meeting on the downside) ."
 But we should not rush to act preemptively in anticipation of such pressures based on arguments about the potential increase in structural unemployment in recent years.
"  - 13 - In this regard, the issue of how much structural damage has been suffered by the labor market is of less immediate concern today in shaping monetary policy than it might have been had we experienced a period of rap id growth during the recovery."
" Remember that, just a few years ago , many forecasters --in and out of the Federal Reserve--were projecting growth rates at an annualized rate of 4 percent  or greater for at least a year."
 That expectation raised the question of whether a reasonably rapid tightening in monetary policy might at some point be needed.
" But now, in part because we did not have such a spike in the early stages of recovery and ins tead have had modest growth in place for several years, it seems less likely that we will experience a growth spurt in the next couple of years that would engender concerns about rapid wage pressures and changes in inflation expectations."
" The Importance  of a National Investment Agenda In short, by promoting maximum employment in a stable inflation environment  around the FOMC target rate, monetary policy can help set the stage for a vibrant and dynamic economy ."
 But there are limits to what monetary policy can do in counteracting the long erterm trends I have discussed.
" For instance, early childhood education can increase the educational attainment of children from low -income families as well as improve other outcomes.16  In addition, recent innovations in job training programs, which more tightly link th e training to the needs of employers in sectors of the economy with a demand for workers, have been shown to increase both the employment and wages  of participants .17 Investment in basic research by the federal government is another area in which greater investments could yield significant returns and in which a public policy role is warranted because of externalities."
" Econometric studies suggest that the rates of return to this type of investment can be very high.18  And a range of policy commenta tors agree that there is  a continuing role for government investment in infrast ructure, including  various forms of  transportation, as a way to enhance productivity."

" After a surge associated with fiscal stimulus during the recent recession, publ ic spending on infrastructure has tumbled, resulting in the slowest growth (1 percent) in the state and local capital stock since WWI I."
" But, like monetary policy, it could play a useful role."
" As should be apparent in my remarks on monetary policy and an investment agenda, I believe that t here are policies already developed and available to us that can contribute to this effort."
"                                                 20 These advantages --such as the country’s substantial natural resources, a stable but adaptive legal framework for economic activity, a dynamic labor market, and a fostering of entrepreneurship --have contributed to productivity growth that is estimated to have averaged about 2 -1/4 percent over the past 140 years."
