"E DT  May 3, 2024         Brief Remarks on the Economy and Monetary Policy     Remarks by   Michelle W."
" Banks play a key role in supporting economic growth and lending to serve their customers and communities, which is an indispensable role in the U.S. economy."
"Before our conversation, I would like to briefly touch  on the economy and monetary policy."
" Over the past two years, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has significantly tightened the stance of monetary policy to address high inflation."
"  After seeing considerable progress o n slowing inflation  last year , we have not seen further pro gress over the first quarter of this year."
" T he 12month measures of total and core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation  have moved roughly sideways since December and remained elevated at 2.7 percent and 2.8 percent , respectively, in March ."
" With annualized 3 -month core PCE inflation jumping to 4.4 percent in March, well above average inflation in the second half of last year, I expect inflation to remain elevated for some time."
" The recent pickup seems to be evident  across many goods and services categories, suggesting that inflation was temporarily lower in the latter half of last year."
" Inflation has hit lower -income households hardest since food , energy, and housing services  price increases far outpaced overall inflation throughout this episode."
Economic activity increased at a strong pace last year and has maintained momentum over the first three months of this year.
" Although first -quarter growth in gross domestic product was temporarily dampened by volatile categories,  such as inventories and net exports, consumer spending on services remained robust , and residential activity and business investment in equipment and intangibles  strengthened."
" P ayroll employment has increased at a strong  pace through April  this year , partly reflectin g increased i mmigrant labor supply."
" Al though w e had seen signs of the labor market coming into better balance, recent employment reports show a continued tight labor market , with the unemployment rate remaining below 4 percent , and the number of job openings relative to unemployed workers is  still above its pre -pandemic level ."
" In recent  months, however, job growth has rebounded, and labor force participation has flattened out around its peak  from last year , suggesting there has not been further improvement in labor supply along this margin, as labor force participation among those aged 55 and older has been  persistently low ."
"  At its current setting , our monetary policy stance appears to be re strictive, and I will continue to monitor the incoming data to assess whether monetary policy is sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to our target."
" As Iâ€™ve noted recently, m y baseline outlook continues to be that inflation will decline further with the policy rate held steady , but I still see a  number of  upside inflation risks that affect my outlook."
"  - 3 -  First, much of the progress on inflation last year was due to supplyside improvements, including easing of supply chain constraints ; increases in the number of available workers, due in part to immigration ; and lower energy prices."
 It is unclear whether further supplyside improvements will continue to lower inflation.
" G eopolitical developments  could also pose upside risks to inflation, including the risk that spillovers from regional conflicts could disrupt global supply chains , putting additional upward pressure on food, energy, and commodity prices."
" There is also the risk that the  loosening in financial conditions since late last year and additional fiscal stimulus  could add momentum to demand, stalling any further progress or even causing inflation to reaccelerate."
"  Finally, there is a risk that strong consumer demand for services , increased immigration, and continued labor market tightness  could lead to persistently high core services inflation."
"  Wage growth has remained at an elevated rate of between 4 and 5 percent, still higher than the pace consistent with our 2 percent inflation goal given trend productivity growth."
"  In light of these risks, and the general uncertainty regarding the economic outlook, I will continue to watch the data closely as I assess the appropriate path of monetary policy."
  - 4 -  It is important to note that monetary policy is not on a preset course.
" While the current stance of monetary policy appears to be at a restrictive level, I remain willing to raise the federal funds rate at a future meeting should the incoming data indicate that progress on inflation has stalled or reversed."
 Restoring price stability is essential for achieving maxi mum employment over the longer run.
