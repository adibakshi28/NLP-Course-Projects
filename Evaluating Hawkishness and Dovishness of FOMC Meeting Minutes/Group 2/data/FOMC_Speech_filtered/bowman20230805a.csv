"   For release on delivery  12:10  p.m. EDT (10:10 a.m. MDT)   August 5, 2023          Brief Remarks on the Economy and Monetary Policy     by  Michelle W."
"  Before we turn to our conversation, I’ll offer a few thoughts on the economy and monetary policy."
" Since March 2022, the FOMC has been tightening monetary policy as part of our ongoing effort to lower unacceptably high inflation."
" Since then, we have seen some progress, and inflation has  declined  from last year’s very  high level."
" Most recently, after more than six months of stubbornly high readings, the June consumer price index showed lower core inflation , a measure that excludes food and energy prices ."
" While this development is a posi tive sign that monetary policy is contributing to lower  inflation, both total and core inflation remain well above our 2 percent target ."
" Consumer spending has been robust, and the housing sector appears to be rebounding with accelera ting growth in house prices and a pickup in new housing starts."
  The most recent employment report showed a strong labor market with low  1 The views expressed here are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee or the Board of Governors.
   - 2 -  unemployment and solid job gains.
" The pace of job gains has slowed, which is a sign that labor market demand and supp ly are coming into better balance."
" But the demand for workers continues to exceed the supply of available job seekers, adding upward pressure on prices."
" While banks have tighten ed lending standar ds in response to higher interest rates and  funding costs, there have not been signs of a  further  sharp contraction in credit  from the stress earlier this year that would slow economic activity ."
" Though loan balance growth has slowed, banks have continued to increase lending to households and businesses."
"   Given the strong economic data and still elevated inflation, I supported the FOMC’s decision in July to further increase the target range for the federal funds rate."
 I also expect that additional rate i ncreases will likely be needed to get inflation on a path down to the FOMC’s 2 percent target.
"  The recent lower inflation reading was positive, but I will be looking for consistent evidence that inflation is on a meaningful path down  toward our 2 percent  goal as I consider further rate increases and  how long the federal funds rate will need to remain at a restrictive level."
  It’s impo rtant to reiterate that monetary policy is not on a preset course.
 We should remain willing to raise the federal funds rate at a future meeting if the incoming data indicate that progress on inflation has stalled.
    - 3 -  Returning inflation to our 2 percent goal is necessary to achieve a sustainably strong labor market and economy.
