"For release on delivery  12:25 p.m. EDT ( 10:25 a.m. MDT ) August 29, 2015          U.S. Inflation Developments     Remarks by   Stanley Fischer   Vice Chair man  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at  Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City Economic Symposium    Jackson Hole, Wyoming         August 29, 2015     I am delighted to be here in Jackson Hole in the company of such distinguished panelists  and such a distinguished group of participants ."
"  I will focus my remarks today on forces --domestic and international --that have been  holding down inflation in the U nited States ,1 and some of the consequences  of recent --primarily international --developments ."
"Although the economy has continued to recover and the labor market is approaching our maximum employment objective, inflatio n has been persistently below 2 percent."
" That has been especially true recently, as  the drop in oil prices over the past year, on the order of about 6 0 percent,  has led directly to lower inflation  as it fe eds through to lower prices of gasoline and other energy items."
" That is, while futures market s suggest that the level of oil prices is expected to remain  well below levels seen last summer , markets do not expect oil prices  to fall further, so their influence in holding down inflation  should be temporary."
" But measures of core inflation, which are intended to help us look through such transitory price movements, have also been relatively low  (return to chart 1) ."
" Moreover, t hese measures of core inflation have been persistently below 2 percent throughout  the economic reco very."
"  That said, as with total inflation, core inflation can be somewhat variable, especially at frequencies higher than 12month changes."
" Moreover, note that core inflation does not entirely “exclude” food and energy, becau se changes in energy prices af fect firms’ costs and so can pass into prices of nonenergy item s."
Inflation as measured by the consumer price index ( CPI) generally sends the same broad message as does the PCE price index (chart 3).
" On average, CPI inflation tends to run a few tenths higher than PCE in flation , and, because the CPI has a modestly larger weight on energy prices , fluctuations in the CPI measure tend to be  a bit larger."
"    Of course, ongoing economic slack is one reason core inflation has been low."
" Although the economy has made great progress, we started seven years ago from an unemployment rate of 10 percent, which guaranteed a lengthy period of high unemployment."
" Even so, with inflation expectations apparently stable, we would have expected the gradual reduction of slack to be associated with less downward price pressure."
" All else equal, we might therefore have expected both headline and core inflation to be moving up more noticeably toward  our 2 percent objective."
" Yet, we have seen no clear evidence of core inflation moving higher over the past few years."
" This fact helps drive home an important p oint:  While much evidence points to at least some ongoing role for slack in helping to explain movements in inflation, this influence is  - 3 - typically estimated to be modest in magnitude, and can easily be masked by other factors.2  In the first instance, as already noted, core inflation can to some extent be influenced by oil prices ."
" However, a larger effect comes from changes in the exchange value of the dollar, and the rise in the dollar over the past year is an important reason inflation has remained low  (chart 4)."
" A higher value of the dollar passes through to lower import prices , which  hold down U.S. inflation both because imports make up part of final consumption, and because lower prices for imported components hold down business costs more generally."
"  In addition, a rise in the dollar restrains the growth of aggregate demand and overall economic activity, and so has some effect on inflation through that more indirect channel.3   To get a sense of the timing and magnitude of these exchange rate effects , chart 5 shows dynamic simulations of a 10 percent real dollar appreciation, based on  one of the                                                  2 Among the many papers finding a role for resource utilization  in affecting inflation  based on evidence from macroeconomic time -series data , see Robert J."

"3 There has also been debate regarding other potential channels through which global factors could affec t domestic inflation --for example, whether measures of foreign resource utilization play an important independent role."
" For evidence supporting such global factors, see Claudio Borio and Andrew Filardo (2007), “Globalisation and Inflation:  New Cross -Coun try Evidence on the Global Determinants of Domestic Inflation,” BIS Working Papers 227 (Basel, Switzerland:  Bank for International Settlements, May), www.bis.org/publ/work227."

" - 4 - models we maintain at the Federal Reserve.4  The estimated passthrough from import prices to consumer price inflation occurs relatively quickly , with effect s becoming evident  within a quarter and the bulk of the overall effect occurring within one year."
" By contrast, t he portion of the dollar effects  on inflation that  work through the channel of overall economic activity  occur s with considerable lags."
" In the model shown here, the appreciation has its largest effect on gross domestic product ( GDP ) growth in the second year after the shock."
" Thus, it is plausible to think that the rise in the dollar over the past year would restrain growth of real GDP  through 2016 and perhaps into  2017 as well."
"  The rise in the dollar since last summer, of about 17 percent in nominal terms, with its associated declines in non -oil import prices, could plausibly be holding down core inflation quite noticeably this year."
   Commodity  prices other than oil are also of relevance for inflation in the U nited States .
" Prices of metals and other  industrial commodities , and agricultural products , are affected to a considerable extent  by developments outside the U nited States , and the softness we’ve seen in these commodity prices , has in part reflected a slowing of demand from China and elsewhere."
 These prices likely have also been a factor in hol ding down inflation in the United States.
  The dynamics with which all these factors affect inflation depend crucially on the behavior of inflation expectations.
 This model incorporates monetary policy responses to economic shocks and thus may show smaller effects on real GDP and inflation than other partial -equilibrium analyses.
   - 5 - that longer -term inflation expectations in the U nited States  appear to have remained  generally stable since the late 1990s  (chart 6).
" The source of that stability is open to debate, but the fact that the Fed has kept inflation relatively low and stable for three decades must be an important part of the explanation."
" Expectations that are not stable, but instead follow actual inflation up or down, would allow inflation to drift persistently."
" In the recent period, movements in inflation have tended to be transitory."
" Thus, the stability of inflation expectations has prevented inflation from falling further below our objective than occurred, and it has enabled the F ederal Open Market Committee  to look through some upwar d inflation shocks without compromising price stability.5   We should however be cautious in our  assessment that inflation expectations are remaining  stable ."
 One reason  is that measures of inflation compensation in the market for Treasury securities have moved down somewhat since last summer  (chart 7).
" But these movements can b e hard to interpret , as at times they may re flect factors other than inflation expectations, such as changes in demand for the unparalleled liquidity  of nominal Treasury securities ."
"In announcing its July interest rate decision, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC ) said: In determining how long to maintain this target range, the Committee will assess progress --both realized and expected --toward its objectives of maximum employmen t and 2 percent inflation."
"This assessment will take into account a wide range of                                                  5 It is noteworthy that in several inflation -targeting economies, the ten year expected inflation rate has settled precisely at the target inflation rate."
"  - 6 - information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developm ents."
 The Committee anticipates that it will be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate when it has seen some further improvement in the labor market and is reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2 percent objec tive over the medium term.
 Can the Committee be “reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term”?
" As I have discussed, g iven the apparent stability of inflation expectations, there is good reason to beli eve that inflation will move higher as the forces holding down inflation dissipate further."
" While some effects of the rise in the dollar may be spread over time, some  of the effects on inflation are likely  already starting to fade."
" And slack in the labor market has continued to diminish, so the downward pressure on inflation from that channel should be diminishing as well."
" In addition, with regard to expectations of inflation, it is possible to consult the results of the SEP, the Survey of Economic Projections, which FOMC participants complete shortly before the March, June, September, and December meetings."
" In the June SEP , the central tendency of FOMC participants’ projections for core PCE inflation was 1.3 percent to 1.4 percent this year, 1.6 percent to 1.9 percent next year, and 1.9 percent to 2.0 percent in 2017."
"  - 7 - Reflecting all these factors, the Committee has indicated in its post -meeting statements that it expects inflation to return to 2 percent."
"   In addition, the Ju ly announcement set a condition of requiring “some  further improvement in the labor market .”  From May through July , nonfarm payroll employment gains have averaged 235,000 per month ."
" We now await the results of the August employment survey, which are due to be published on September 4."
" Of course, the FOMC’s monetary policy decision is not a mech anical one, based purely on the set of numbers reported in the payroll  survey and in our judgment on the degree of confidence members of the committee have about future inflation."
" We are interested also in aspects of the labor market beyond the simple U -3 measure of unemployment, including for example the rates of unemployment of older workers and of those working part -time for economic reasons; we are interested also in the participation rate."
 And in the case of the inflation rate we look beyond the r ate of increase of PCE prices  and define the concept of the core rate of inflation .
"   While thinking of different aspects of unemployment, we are concerned mainly with trying to find the right measure of the difficulties caused to current and potential participants in the labor force  by their unemployment ."
" In the case of the core rate of inflation, we are mainly looking for a good indicator of future inflation, and for better indicators than we have at present."
"  In making our monetary policy decisions, we a re interested more in where the U.S. economy is heading than in knowing whence it has come."
 That is why we need to  - 8 - consider the overall state of the U.S. economy a s well as the influence of foreign economies on the U.S. economy as we reach our judgment on  whether and how to change monetary policy.
  That is why we follow economic developments in the rest of the world as well as the United States in reaching our interest rate decisions.
"  The Fed has, appropriately, responded to the weak economy and low inflation in recent years by taking a highly ac commodative policy stance."
" By committing to foster the movement of inflation toward our 2 percent objective, we are enhanc ing the credibility of monetary policy and support ing the continued stability of inflation expectations."
"  To do what monetary policy can do towards meeting our goals of maximum employment and price stability, and to ensure that these goals will continue to be met as we move ahead, w e will most likely need to proceed cautiously in normalizing the stance of monetary policy ."
" For the purpo se of meeting our goals, the entire path of interest rates matters more than the particular timing of the first increase."
"   With inflation low, we can probably  remove accommodation  at a gradual pace ."
" Yet, because monetary policy influences real activity w ith a substantial lag, we should not wait until inflation is back to 2 percent to begin tightening."
