"For release on delivery  9:00 a.m. EDT  May 12, 2021         U.S. Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy     Remarks by   Richard H ."
" I look forward , as always, t o my conversation with Ellen Zentner , but first, please allow  me to offer a few remarks on the economic outlook, Federal Reserve monetary policy, and our new monetary policy framework ."
" Gross domestic product  (GDP ) collapsed by more than 30 percent at an annual rate in the second quarter of 2020;  more than 22 million jobs were lost , wiping out a decade of employment gains ; the unemployment rate rose from a 50 -year low of 3.5 percent  in February to almost 15 percent in April ; and inflation plummeted in response to a collapse in aggregate demand that dwarfed the contraction in aggregate supply."
" So far, the economic activity data we have received this year is consistent with this outlook."
" However, after looking at the details of Friday’s disappointing employment report, the near -term outlook for the labor market appears to be more uncertain than the  outlook for economic activity."
" Employment remains 8.2 million below its pre -pandemic peak, and the true unemployment rate adjusted for participation is closer to 8.9 percent  than to 6.1 percent ."
" At the recent pace of payroll gains—roughly 500,000 per month over the past three months —it would take until August 2022 to restore employment to its pre -pandemic level."
 But what this necessary rebalancing of labor supply and demand means for wage and price dynamics will depend importantly on the pace of recovery in labor force participation as well as the extent to which there are post -pandemic mismatches between labor demand and supply in specific sectors of the economy and how long any such imbalances persist.
  Readings on inflation on a year -overyear basis have recently increased and are likely to rise somewhat further before moderating  later this year.
" O ver the next few months, 12month measures of inflation are expected to move above our 2 percent  longer -run goal , largely reflecting , I believe, tra nsitory factors such as a run of year -overyear comparisons with depressed servicesector prices recorded last spring a s well as the  - 3 - emergence of some supply bottlenecks that may limit how quickly production can rebound in certain sectors ."
" However, under my baseline outlook, these onetime increases in prices are likely to have only transitory effects on underlying inflation , and I expect inflation to return to —or perhaps run somewhat above —our 2 percent  longer -run goal in 2022 and 2023."
" As announced in the September 2020 FOMC statement and reiterated in the following statements—including the most recent one —with inflation running persis tently below 2 percent, our policy will aim to achieve inflation outcomes that keep inflation expectations well anchored at our 2 per cent longer -run goal.3  We expect to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomes—as well as our maximum -employment mandate —are achieved."
 W e also expect it will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the  2 The 2020 Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy is available on the Board’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/review -ofmonetary -policy -strategy -tools -andcommunications -statement -onlonger -rungoals -monetary -policy -strategy.htm .
" - 4 - Committee’s assessments of maximum employment , until  inflation has risen to 2 percent , and until inflation is  on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time."
" We indicated that we will continue to increase our holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and our holdings of agency mortgage -backed securities by at least $40  billion per month until su bstantial further progress, measured relative to the December 202 0 announcement, has been made toward  our maximumemployment and price -stability goals."
"   In our new framework, we acknowledge that  policy decisions going forward will be based on the FOMC’s estimates of “shortfalls  [emphasis added] of employment from its maximum level” —not “deviations .”4  This language means that , going forward, a low unemployment rate, in and of itself, will not be sufficient to trigger a tightening of monetary policy absent any evidence from other indicators that inflation is at risk of moving above mandate -consistent levels."
" With regard to our  price -stability mandate, while the new statement maintains our definition that the longerrun goal for inflation is 2 percent, it elevates the importance —and the challenge—of keeping inflation expectations well anchored  at 2 percent  in a world  in which an effective -lower -bound constraint is, in downturns, binding on the federal funds rate .5  To this end, the new  4 The most recent version of the 2012 statement is available on the Board’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_LongerRunGoals _201901.pdf ."
5 The Fed staff’s index of common inflation expectations —which is now updated quarterly on the Board’s website —is a relevant indicator that this goal is being met .
" See Hie Joo  Ahn and Chad Fulton (2020) , “Index of Common Inflation Expectations,” FEDS Notes (Washington:  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, September 2 ), https://doi.org/10.17016/2380 -7172.2551 ; and Hie Joo  Ahn and Chad Fulton  (2021) , “Research Data Series:  In dex of Common Inflation Expectations,” FEDS Notes (Washington:  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, March 5 ), https://doi.org/10.17016/2380 -7172.2873."
"   - 5 - statement conveys the Committee’s judgment that, in order  to anchor expectations at the 2 percent  level consistent with price stability , it will conduct policy to achieve inflation outcomes that keep long -run inflation expectations anchored at our 2 percent  longer -run goal."
" As Chair Powell  indicated in his Jackson Hole remarks, we think of our new framework as an evolution from “flexible inflation targeting” to  a “flexible form of average inflation targeting.”6  While this new framework represents a robust evolution in our monetary policy strategy, this strategy is in service to the dual -mandate goals of monetary policy assigned to the Federal Reserve by the Congress —maximum employment and price stability —that remain  unchanged.7 Concluding Remarks Notwithstanding the recent flow  of encouraging macro economic data , the economy remains  a long way from our goals, and it is likely to take some time for substantial further progress to be achieved."
 Our guidance for interest rates and asset purchases ties the path of the federal funds rate and the size of the balance sheet to our employment and inflation goals.
