"3  Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, “FDIC Statistics.”  4  Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, “FDIC Statistics.”  - 4 -  In my view, there are several features of the current U.S. banking system that suggest there is an unmet demand for de novo bank charters."
" I will briefly note three in particular : (1) the ongoing demand for “ charter strip ” acquisitions ; (2) the shift of traditional banking activities out of the banking sector into nonbank financial entities, or the “shadow banking” sector ; and (3)  the rising demand for bankingas-aservice partner ships ."
" The replacement business model often emphasizes novel technologies and rapid growth, and if the existing, legacy banki ng business of the target  is retained, it is often operated separately from the new business ."
" The ongoing demand for charter strip formations , however, reveals  a disparity in treatment between de novo formations and char ter strips , a disparity attributable to the differen ce in expectations and regulatory burden between these two paths."
" For example, mortgage origination and servicing—both longstanding, traditional banking activities —shifted into nonbank entities following the 2008 financial crisis, with the volume of one -tofour family mortgages originated by nonbanks surpassing the volume originated by banks starting in 2016.5  Nonbank lenders also play a significant role in leverage d lending and corporate lending, a s well as in commercial real estate lending, agricultural lend ing, and consumer credit.6   The growth of lending in the shadow banking system can have significant consequences for the availability of credit over economic  cycles , with losses eventually being trans ferred  to regulated depository institutions , as appear s to have occurred after the 2008 financial crisis.7  While the disfavored activities may be pushed out of the regulated banking system, losses may be transmitted back into the banking system through related activities like the extension of credit by banks to those same nonbank lenders."
 These types of relationships can be valuable for community banks; they can help the bank provide new services or access new  customers and can give the bank new business growth opportunities.
" The Consequences of Limited De Novo Formation  The continued interest in charter strip acquisitions, the shift of activities out of regulated banks into the shadow banking system , and the continued growth in bankingas-aservice partnerships  all suggest that th ere may be some unmet demand for bank charters."
" As a practical - 9 -  matter, the consolidation of banks coupled with a deficit of new bank formations, if left unaddressed over time, could have several significant consequences."
 Does the target market have a strong economy and good growth prospects?
" For example, since the 2008 financial crisis, and until relatively recently, we have operated in a very low interest rate environment."
 Low interest rate environment s lead to compress ion of  interest rate spreads for taking deposits and making loans.
" Similarly, the demand for banking services tends to track broader economic conditions, independent from bank regulatory policy."
" Even t he demands of raising sufficient capital —a vital step in the de novo process —may pose challenges, as the total amount of capital is based on a forward -looking projection of the bank’s expected future  size."
" De novo banks often experience rapid growth, poor initial profitability, and loan quality issues that take time to emerge as the bank’s portfolio matures ."
