"   To start off this conference on global linkages, I am going to discuss supply shocks, policy spillovers , and common challenges faced by monetary policymakers in recent years and going forward ."
" - 2 -  As economies gradually reopened, demand surged, especially for goods ."
" But supply chains  were slower to recover , leading to a global surge in inflation."
" That surge was followed by a fur ther upswing in inflation after February 2022, when Russia’s invasion of Ukraine  caused a shock to global supplies of commodities, including oil and natural gas, food and fertilizers, and numerous  manufacturing inputs."
" With inflation unacceptably high, m onetary policy turned toward tightening."
" Central banks in several emerging market economies began to tighten first, seeking to prevent a de -anchoring of inflation expectations that could cause elevated inflation to become entrenched."
" Those actions have tightened U.S. financial conditions, acting to dampen U.S. aggregate demand."
" Activity in the housing sector has slowed significantly, with 30year mortgage rates rising to more than 7 percent, and business spending has been constrained by high interest rates and reduced  credit availability."
" Over the past year,  amid tightening financial conditions globally, inflation has come down from its peak in most economies."
" In the U .S., inflation ( as measured by the 12month change in the personal consumption expenditures price index)  has fallen from 7.1 percent in June 2022 to 3.4 percent in September of this year."
 Core inflation has declined  from a peak of  5.6 percent  in February 2022 to 3.7 percent in September .
 I believe the Federal Reserve’s actions contributed to this fall in inflation both by restraining aggregate demand and by keeping longer -term inflation expectations well anchored.
 - 3 -  The fall in headline inflation was helped by declines in global commodity prices from their 2022 peaks.
 This recovery has occurred both because of supply responses motivated by high prices for transportation and key inputs and because of a shift of demand from goods back toward services.
" That slowing will feed over time into a continued decline of  inflation in rents and owners ’ equivalent rents ( the rent s that homeowners forgo by living in their own homes rather than renting them  out), thus contributing importantly to the expected further reduction in overall U.S. inflation."
"   Over this year, payroll growth has slowed but remained strong."
 And a broad set of indicators show labor demand and labor supply coming into better balance.
" To be sure , it is a good thing that the easing in supply–demand imbalances in the labor market and the disinflation we are seeing thus far have taken place with  only a modest increase in the unemployment  rate, which was 3.9 percent in October ."
" I am also encouraged by the s trong growth in labor productivity over the past two quarters , which , if sustained , could contribute to furt her progress toward price stability ."
" I believe that a soft landing is possible, with continued disinflation and a strong labor market, but it is not assured."
" - 5 -  In setting monetary policy, we need to seek a policy stance that is sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation back to 2 percent over time."
" We have seen continued momentum in economic  growth and consumer spending, even in the face of monetary policy tightening over the past year and a half."
 There is a risk that such continued momentum in demand could keep the economy and labor mar ket tight and slow the pace of disinflation.
   But I am also attuned to the risk of an unnecessarily sharp decline in economic activity and employment.
" Homebuilders have done surprisingly well over the past year and a half, but they see the current level of mortgage rates as substantially slowing demand."
"As we try to identify the full, lagg ed effects of monetary policy tightening, I am considering whether  small businesses, the housing sector, and low - and moderate -income households could be  warning of broader stress ahead."
"  I also see signs of subdued economic growth in our major trading partners , whose health  affect s U.S. economic conditions related  to our dual mandate ."
" China’s economic  growth has  remained below pre -pandemic rates , and a ctivity in its  property sector has been  extremely weak."
"  In Europe, recent data point to muted growth as the region deals with tightened financial conditions and the effects of past energy price shocks."
"   The Federal Open Market Committee is, of course, focused on our dual mandate of maximum employment and stable prices in the U.S.   But I recognize that we act in a world of global markets and strong economic linkages."
 I  pay close attention to the spillovers of our policies abroad and spillovers to our economy from monetary policy in other countries.
 We would expect the monetary policy of one country to have spillovers to other economies  through three main channels.2   The first channel works through domestic demand.
" Taking the U.S. as an example, w hen U.S. monetary policy tightens, U.S. aggregate demand slows, lowering U.S. imports of foreign products and dampening foreign gross domestic product ( GDP ) and foreign inflation."
" The second  channel, the financial channel , captures the effects of the rise in U.S. longer -term yields that typically accompanies a tightening of U.S. monetary policy."
" - 7 -  their portfolios from foreign to U.S. assets, tightening foreign financial conditions and reducing GDP and inflation in foreign economies .3  The fact that the bulk of international transactions are denominated in dollars gives U.S. monetary policy a n especially  salient role through the financial channel."
 A surprise increase in U.S. interest rate s relative to foreign rates usually leads to dollar appreciation.
 The weaker currency and the resulting higher activity abroad tend to push up foreign inflation.
" So in the end , while currency depreciation unambiguously raises inflation, its effect on GDP can be ambiguous for some countries."
" For instance, w hen the tightening occurs in the context of high growth, the positive spillovers of that growth can partial ly offset the adverse spillover s from the  3 The financial channel has been documented in recent academic literature, including Rey (2013) and Iacoviello and Navarro (201 9)."
" The importance of the context in which monetary policy is changing is increasingly being emphasized in the literature , such as the paper to be presented in session 4 of this conference ."
" The s taff at the Federal Reserve also have looked at these differences using both event -study and model -based approaches.4 An additional  concern, very relevant to the current situation, is what happens when monetary policy is being tightened simultaneously  across a wide set of economies."
 - 9 -  as well as the resulting global rise in interest rates  following the inflationary shocks from  Russia’s war against  Ukraine .
"In sum, U.S. monetary policy actions can produce spillovers abroad and create tradeoffs for foreign  monetary policy."
" Spillovers from foreign economies can be sizable for the U.S.  as well, especially in the current environment , in which many central banks have tighten ed policy rapidly  to fight inflation."
" At the Federal Reserve, we are responsible for getting U.S. inflation down to our target."
