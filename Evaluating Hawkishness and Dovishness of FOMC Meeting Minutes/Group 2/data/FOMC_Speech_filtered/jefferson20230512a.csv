"For release on delivery  7:45 p.m. EDT (4: 45 p.m. PDT)  May 12, 2023          On the Assessment of Current Monetary Policy    Remarks by   Philip N."
" I welcome hearing diverse views on how to best conduct monetary policy, and this conference is certainly providing an invigorating debate on that topic."
" First, the title presupposes that U.S. monetary policy is currently on the wrong track."
" According to the Hoover webpage, “A key goal of the conference is to examine how to get back on track and, thereby, how to reduce the inflation rate without  slowing down economic growth” (emphasis added).1  As this audienc e knows, there are macroeconomic models that permit disinflation with no slowdown in economic growth, but the assumptions  1 See the conference’s webpage at www.hoover.org/events/how -getback-track -policyconference."
"  - 2 - underlying these models are very strong.2  It’s not clear, at least to me, why such a strict metric would be used to assess real -worl d monetary policymaking."
" Against this semantic backdrop, I will begin my remarks with my perspective on the current inflation and economic situation."
"  Next, I will offer some normative thoughts about strategic monetary policymaking in highly uncertain environments."
" Finally, I will argue that if you are willing to widen your lens to include a more commonplace definition, then it is possible to conclude t hat current monetary policy is, in fact, “on track.” Current Inflation in the U.S.  Current inflation is still high."
" Personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation , the black line, stands at 4.2 percent, and core PCE inflation , the red line, stands at 4.6 percent  for yearend March 2023."
" Overall , news on inflation so far this year has been mixed."
"  The good news is that food and energy prices both fell in March, and total PCE  inflation  slowed to 4.2 percent from 5 percent  in February."
" Since peaking last June, inflation  has declined about  2 Estimates of the cost of disinflation depend on the model used to measure it."
" Classical models, in which rational expectations play a dominant role in determining the cost of disinflation, show low cost, while Keynesian models, in which slack in the economy is needed to reduce inflation, show high cost."
" See, for example, Sargent (1982), Croushore (1992), Goodfriend and King (2005), and Tetlow (2022) for a comparison of the cost of disinflation across macroeconomic forecasting models."
  The bad news is that there has been little progress on core inflation.
 The drivers of inflation in each of these sectors differ somewhat and understanding the different causes and how they affect the different components can help predict the future course of inflation.
" Core goods inflation, the red line in figure 2, has come down since its peak of 7.6 percent in February 2022, but the most recent news has been discouraging."
" Outside of used motor vehicle prices, which fell unexpectedly  in March, disinflation in core goods prices is occurring at a slower pace  than expected."
 Supply and demand imbalances in the goods sector seem to be resolving less quickly than expected.
" Core housing services inflation, the black line in figure 2, surged over the past couple of years as demand in the housing sector underwent a major shift during the pandemic."
" In contrast, core services excluding housing inflation, the blue dashed line in figure 2, has not shown much sign of slowing."
"   - 4 - Labor Market and GDP Growth  Turning to labor markets, the April 2023 employment report data continue to point to a strong labor market amid improvements in labor supply, with the prime -age labor force participation rate exceeding its pre -pandemic level."
 Wage growth has continued to run ahead of the pace consistent with 2 percent inflation and current trends in productivity growth.
" Over the 12 months ended in March 2023, the employment cost index (ECI) for total hourly compensation for private -sector workers rose 4.8 percent, down only a little from its peak of 5.5 percent last June ."
"   Despite strong growth in consumption spending, gross domestic product ( GDP ) grew modestly at an annual rate of 1.1 percent i n the first quarter of 2023 as inventory investment slowed down substantially, similar to the below -trend pace of growth in 2022."
" Looking ahead, last quarter’s growth in consumer spending seems unsustainable."
" Moreover, I expect slower consumer spending growth over the remainder of the year in response to tight financial conditions, depressed consumer sentiment, greater uncertainty, and decl ines in overall household wealth and excess savings."
 Recent Stress in the Banking Sector  The tightening in financial conditions we have seen in response to our monetary policy actions is likely to be augmented by the effects  on credit conditions from rece nt strains in the banking sector.
"  Nevertheless, it is reasonable to expect that recent  stress event s will lead banks to tighten credit standards further.4  Even though it is too early to tell , my view is that these incremental credit restraints will have a mild retardant effect on economic growth because the recent bank failures were isolated and addressed swiftly by aggressive macro - and micro -prudential policy actions."
" Monetary Policymaking and Current Uncertainties  The pandemic aftermath, geopolitical instability, and bankingsector stress have contributed to a highly uncertain economic environment ."
" Additionally, the numerous postpandemic “surprises” in inflation, employment, and economic growth suggest that the underlying structure of the U.S. economy may be in flux."
 The answer to this question is likely to be different for each monetary policymaker.
" First, policymakers should be ready to react to a wide range of economic conditions with respect to inflation, unemployment, economic growth, and financial stability."
" Second, policymakers should clearly communicate monetary policy decisions to the public."
" Our commitment to transparency should be evident to the public, and monetary policy should be conducted in a way that anchors longer -term inflation expectations."
"   While these principles do not constitute  a complete monetary policy making framework, I think they are useful when thinking  about features of such frameworks ."
"Conclusion   By way of concluding, I would like to return to the  question of whether current monetary policy is “on track” but allow for the wider defining lens of “achieving or doing what is necessary or expected.”  The national unemployment rate was 3.6 percent  in March 2022 when the current monetary policy tightening cycle began."
" Today, after  - 7 - 500 basis points of tightening of the policy rate, the national unemployment rate stands at a near -record low of 3.4 percent ."
" At its recent peak , total PCE inflation was 7 percent  in June 2022."
  Is inflation still too high?
 Has the current disinflation been uneven and slower than any of us would like?
"  Furthermore, monetary policy affects the economy and inflation with long and varied lags, and the full effects of our rapid tightening are still likely ahead of us."
