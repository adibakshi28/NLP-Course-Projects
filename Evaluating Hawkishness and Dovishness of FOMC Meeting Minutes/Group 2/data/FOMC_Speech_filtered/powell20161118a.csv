" According to the International Monetary Fund’s latest World Economic Outlook , global  gross domestic product (GDP ) is set to grow at only 3.1 percent this year , the lowest  rate of growth  since the G lobal Financial C risis."
" Investment and productivity remain subdued, despite extremely low and even negative interest rates in many economies.1  One  key aspect of global weakness  that is of particular  relevance to emerging  Asian economies  is the sharp slowdown in global trade ."
" Third , I will turn to the implications of th is slowdown for economic growth in the region."
" And , finally, I will offer some views on how Asian economies can respond to the slowdown by re thinking their “export -led growth” paradigm."
"                                                   1 The World  Economic Outlook’s  headline growth numbers aggregate global growth, using PPP -based GDP weights."
" They also compute growth using GDP weights based on market exchange rates, according to which global growth this year is projected to be even lower, at 2.4 p ercent."
" On a real inflation -adjusted basis, world imports have grown at an average annual rate of less than 3 -1/2 percent since 2011, about half the 7 percent pace seen in the eight  years prior to the G lobal F inancial C risis.3  As illustrated in the next slide, tr ade is  no longer outpacing GDP growth."
" Real trade growth has been lower over the 201115 period compared with the 200007 period for every G -20 country outside of Japan, where trade growth was constant."
  The third slide shows that the fall in real import growth in emerging Asia has been particularly pronounced from over 10 percent in the first period to just about 3 percent in the second.
 But imp ort growth has declined in Latin America and the advanced economies as well.
 The next slide shows the differential between real import growth and real GDP growth for the same two periods .
" For emerging Asia, the differential went from positive to substantially negative, indicating that real import growth slowed to well below real GDP growth."
"  -4foreign economies , the differential was just about zero in the more recent period , indicating that real import growth barely ke pt pace with GDP growth ."
"     Is the trade slowdown just another manifestation of slow growth, or is it an independent concern?"
" W eak global grow th is surely part of the explanation , as emphasized  by several recent empirical studies, including a special chapter on the topic in the latest IMF World Economic Outlook .5  As can be seen in slide 5, g lobal GDP growth has fallen from an average of  3.5 percent before the G lobal F inancial C risis to about 2.5 percent since  its end."
  But weak global growth alone does not explain why trade has slowed to about the same pace as GDP  after growing faster than GDP for decades .
" A stark case in point is the G lobal F inancial C risis, when plummeting demand for investment and durable goods --two highly traded expenditure categories --contributed to  the sharp 4 percentage point fall in the ratio of world trade  to GDP ."
 The special weakness in some components of demand has persisted beyond the crisis and c ould als o explain some of the recent sluggishness in trade relative to GDP .
" In particular, as you can see from the middle two bars  of slide 5 , the slowdown in world investment growth-- from about 4.5 percent growth before the G lobal F inancial C risis to only about 3 percent growth since 2011--has been                                                  5 International Monetary Fund (2016a); see also O rganization for E conomic Cooperation and D evelopment  (2016), European Central Bank (2016), and Hoekman (2015)."
    -5more pronounc ed than the slowdown in world GDP growth  or in world consumption.
" Increased fragmentation of production across international borders --a natural outgrowth of the gains from specialization --meant  more trade for any given value of final production, thus adding to the major expansion in gross trade flows in the 1990s and 2000s ."
"  Not only is China’s trade being affected by all of the factors just discussed, but ongoing structural changes with in the Chinese economy, including rebalancing toward domestic demand, are exerting an independent effect on world trade flows."
" So, let’s look next at China in more detail.7 China  After  years of rapid export -led growth, China is now among the world’s leaders  in both exports and imports."
" At the same time, China’s industrialization and export model has greatly increased its own demand for  imports of raw materials , intermediate inputs , and parts and components."
" In recent years, howev er, growth in both Chinese imports and Chinese exports  has slowed markedly."
" As shown in slide 7, under a counterfactual in which China’s trade growth had not slowed relative to its GDP  since 2011, global trade would still be growing as a share of GDP.8                                                  7 Another explanation that has been put forward for much of the decline in world trade relative to world GDP is an increased weight of EMEs in the contribution to global growth together with the property that EMEs have lower income elasticities of trade than advanced economies do."
" This  trend in part reflects weak global demand , as weaker demand for final goods and services from the advanced economies should have led Chinese processing exports  to fall disproportionately."
" Another manifestation  can be seen in s lide 9, which show s the decline in the share of parts and                                                  9 A recent note from the Banque du France-- Gaullier, Steingress, and Zignago (2016) --argues that the long run elasticity of world trade to income is unity, and that structural changes in China go a long way in explaining both the sharp rise in the elasticity in the years before the Global Financial Crisis and the subsequent decline in the post -crisis years as China rebalances toward domestic demand."
"    -8components in China’s total ma nufactured imports  from about 65 percent in 2005 to under 50 percent in 2014.10  These two pieces of evidence suggest that the shift away from parts and components in Chinese imports is not just due to lower orders tied to weak import demand in the advanced economies, but also due to the rising productivity and sophistication of the Chinese labor force , which is enabling China to move to higher value -added exports."
" Anecdotal evidence suggests, though, that some of this shift is also t aking place within China , as low -value -added production shifts to low -wage areas in China’s interior .11     The third important structural change affecting Chinese trade is th e progres s China is making in moving away from its export -led model of economic growth and rebalancing its economy toward domestic demand."
 But t he rebalancing toward domestic demand will likely put a damper on China’s trade for some time  as resources shift away from trade -intensive  manufacturing.
"  Implications for Growth in the Region  Having examined developments in world and Chinese trade, let me turn to the implications of these trends  for economic growth in the emerging Asia region."
 These factors enhance productivity and growth and result in the availability of a greater variety of goods to consumers at lower prices.
"  It is safe to say that over the years, the Asian economies have benefited from their high degree of export orientation through all of these transmission mechanisms.14 A number of academic studies have found a causal link between openness and growth.15  A simple scatter plot of economic growth across countries over the period from 2000 to 2007 against their export orientation, presented in slide  12, is telling : More tradeintensive economies have grow n significantly faster over this  period, and t he fast -growing emerging Asian economies shown by the red dots have generally been among the most export -oriented ."
" Given that trade benefited the  Asian economies on the way up, it seems  natural that the slowdown i n global trade, whatever its causes, c ould lead to some loss of dynamism and growth in the region."
" For China, the shift away from trade dependence is partly a reflection of policy choice, with rebalancing seen as a way to sustain growth in the face of som e exhaustion of the                                                  14 Some --Page (1994), for example --have argued that industrial policies favoring certain export industries have also played an important role in Asia’s success, but it seems to be generally agreed that industrial support was only maintained conditional on successful performance on world markets."
" But many other Asian economies’ fortunes are tied to those of China , so developments in China will have important implications for growth in these economies."
" This evidence, combined with the evidence I presented earlier on trends in Chinese processing exports, suggests that other economies in Asia are being adversely affected both by less final global demand for Chinese exports and by less use of imported parts and components by China in the production of any given amount of final goods exports."
" And the effects of these shifts in supply chains  are being offset only very slowly and to only a very limited extent by China importing  more goods for domestic consumption.16  Accordingly, it is doubtful that, at least so far, China is fully replacing advancedeconomy demand as an engine of growth for the rest of emerging Asia."
 One way to look more concretely at this issue is to estimate an equation for the growth for e merging Asia ex.
China that separately controls for the effect s of Chinese growth and advancedeconomy growth.
" This chapter concludes that for many c ountries the effect of China’s transition and rebalancing toward a more sustainable growth model will entail shortrun negative spillovers, but there will be potential gains to the global economy over the longer term."
"  -12see the direct contribution of Chinese growth to that of its neighbors at the margin, apar t from the indirect effect due to China’s exports to advanced economies."
" Note that in the first half of the 2000s, the effect of advanced -economy growth on emerging Asia ex."
"China  (shown on the left) steadily rises from near zero to a one -toone effect by 2005, whereas the coefficient on Chinese growth (on the right) hovers around 0.25 and is  statistically insignificant."
"  H owever, after the G lobal Financial C risis, we see the coefficient on advanced -economy growth move down some , whereas the coefficient on China’s growth rises to 0.5 and becomes statistically significant."
" But the direct effect of advanced -economy growth is still larger than the direct effect of Chinese growth , consistent with the idea that it is still early days for the rebalancing of China’s economy and that China will only slowly supplant the role of advanced economies as drivers of emerging Asian growth."
" Rethinking the “Export -Led Growth” Paradigm   That bring s me to the final topic of my remarks today, which is how emerging Asia can respond to the global trade slowdown and the structural changes taking place in China."
" Some of the structural changes I have discussed suggest that the recent deceleration of trade relati ve to GDP will likely persist and that we may expect global trade to grow perhaps about as fast as, but not substantially faster  than, global GDP growth for the foreseeable future."
" I would argue that, instead of trying to restore growth through enhancing external surpluses, under the circumstances it makes more sense for emerging Asia to focus on domestic demand as an engine of its growth, and to allow their trade and current account surpluses to shrink."
" Encouraging domestic demand and allowing for downward adjustment of these surpluses in emerging Asia, with more balances turning into deficits, would provide a much -needed injection of demand into the global economy  and also support  economic growth in the region  by providing another source of growth in place of the lessened impetus from external demand ."
"A shift toward external deficits in Asia would be advantageous , considering the low level of external financing costs at present."
" Many observers are raising the possibility of a “new normal” for the global economy, in which moderate global demand, low productivity  growth , and slow trade may persist for some time, keeping interest rates in the advanced economies “low for long.”  To be sure, bond yields have moved up recently, but they remain quite low by historical standards."
"  -14worry about volatility of these flows and how they might exacerbate risks of financial instability, particularly as U.S. monetary policy normalizes."
"  Given all this, dare we imagine a world in which private capital inflows to EMEs could prove self -sustaining , are not offset by reverse flows of official capital,  and would finance long -term profitable investment that would help support growth in these economies while also  support ing global growth ?"
" In essence, these capital inflows would finance the shift from export -led growth to domestic -led growth required by the slowdown in global trade."
"  And, with little or no official outflows, EMEs would have total capital net inflows as well , consistent with running current account deficits instead of current account surpluses."
" The point is that at th is current juncture of the global economy, i t is all the more important for emerging Asian economies —and, indeed, emerging market economies more broadly —to enhance domestic demand while pursuing                                                  18 See Bernanke (2015)."
