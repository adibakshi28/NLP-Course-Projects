"For release on delivery  3:15 a.m.  EDT ( 9:15 a.m.  local time ) May 8, 2018         Monetary Policy Influences on Global Financial Conditions  and International Capital Flows    Panel r emarks by   Jerome H."
"Powell   Chair man  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at  “Challenges for Monetary Policy and the GFSN in an Evolving Global Economy”  Eighth High -Level Conference on the International Monetary System  sponsored by the International Monetary Fund and Swiss National Bank   Zurich, Switzerland         May 8, 2018   Thank you for inviting me  to join you t oday as part of this distinguished panel."
"  Our subject is the relationship between “center country” monetary policy and global financial conditions , and the  policy implications of that r elationship both for the center country and for other countries affected."
 Today I will focus in particular on the role of U.S. monetary policy in driving gl obal financial conditions and capital flows.
" To preview my conclusions, I will argue that, while global factors play an important role in influencing domestic financial conditions, the role of U.S. monetary policy is often exaggerated."
" And while financia l globalization does pose some challenges for monetary policy, efforts to build stronger and more transparent policy frameworks and a more resilient financial system  can reduce the adverse consequences of external shocks ."
"  The well -known Mundell -Fleming “ trilemma” states that it is not possible to have all three of the following things:  free  capital mobility, a fixed exchange rate, and the ability to pursue an independent monetary policy."
" The trilemma does not  say that a flexible exchange rate will always fully insulate domestic economic conditions from external shocks.1  And , indeed, that is not the case."
" We have seen that integration of global capital markets can make for difficult tradeoffs for some economies, whether  they have fixed or floa ting exchange rate regimes."
" To illustrate this point, the scatterplot on the left side of figure 1 focuses on movements in interest rates and exchange rates following                                                  1 See, for example, Klein and Shambaugh (2013) and Obstfeld (2015)."
" As you can see, changes in U.S. interest rates after Fed policy actions (shown on the hori zontal axis) lead to corresponding changes in the value of the dollar (shown on the vertical axis)."
  But the influence of U.S. monetary policy on global financial conditions should not be over stated .
" In fact, the United States is the recipient as well as the originator of monetary policy spillovers."
" For example, as seen in figure 3, changes in German yields after European Central Bank policy decisions also pass through to U.S. yields.3  More broadly, it is notable that although the Fed has raised its target interest rate six times since December 2015 and has begun to shrink its balance sheet, overall U.S. domestic financial conditions have gotten looser, in part due to impr oving global conditions and central bank policy abroad."
  Much of the discussion of the spillovers of U.S. monetary policy focuses on their effects on financial conditions in emerging market economies (EMEs).
" 3 Curcuru, De  Pooter, and Eckerd (2018) find that about half of the movement in German bund yields in a window following ECB monetary policy announcements spills over to U.S. Treasury yields, roughly the same magnitude as the spillover of movements in U.S Treasury yields to German bund yields following Federal Reserve policy announcements."
" If U.S. monetary policy is not the major determinant, what other factors have been driving EME capital flows?"
 One prominent factor has been growth differentials between EMEs and advanced economies.
" In f igure 5, the left panel shows that capital inflows to EMEs picked up post -crisis, in line with the widening of this growth differential, while the slowdown in inflows after 2011 coincides with its narrowing."
" The pickup in both global growth and commodity prices over the past couple of years explains a good part of the recent recovery of capital flows to EMEs.5                                                  4 See, for example, Wheatley and Garnham (2010) and Rajan (2014) ."
" Many EMEs have substantially improved the ir fiscal and monetary policy frameworks  while adopting more flexible exchange rates, a policy that recent research shows provides better insulation from external financial shocks.6  Corporate debt  at risk--the debt of firms with limited debt service capacity --has been rising in EMEs, as shown in f igure 7.7  But this rise has been relatively limited outside of China and has begun to reverse as stronger global growth has pushed up earnings."
" The resul ts in IMF (2017) also indicate that while global financial conditions explain a significant portion of countries’ domestic financial conditions, domestic monetary policy changes also play an important role in economies with flexible exchange rates."
" Some investors and institutions may not be well positioned for a rise in interest rates, even one that markets broadly anticipate ."
"    Moreover, t he linkages among monetary policy, asset prices, and the mood of global financial markets  are not fully understood."
" Some observers have argued that U.S. monetary policy also influences capital f lows through its effects on global risk sentiment, with looser policy leading to more positive sentiment in markets and tighter policy depressing sentiment.8  While those channels may well operate, research at both the Fed and the I MF suggest s that actions  by major central banks account for only a relatively small fraction of global financial volatility and capital flow movements.9 Nevertheless, r isk sentiment  will bear close watching as normalization proceeds around the world."
 What can the Federal Reserve do to foster continued financial stability and economic growth as normalization proceeds?
"  9 For example , Londono and Wilson (2018) find that U.S. monetary policy variables account for only roughly 10 percent of the sixmonth ahead forecast error variance of the VIX ."
" In fact, in their study, non -U.S. global factors (non -U.S industrial production, a global E conomic Policy Uncertainty Index, and the expected probability of recessions outside of the United States) explain nearly as much of the VIX forecast error variance as U.S. monetary policy and other U.S. variables combined."
