" Today, I will focus my talk on three topics:  the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate  goals for monetary policy , recent indicat ors of progress toward meeting those  goals , and what we call the evolving “balance of risks ,” which means how the probabilities of missing one of those goals,  compared to the other , change over time .1  My main message is that, following a period of unusually high inflation and rapid monetary -policy tightening, inflation has fallen considerably while the labor market has remained strong ."
" As a result  of these welcome developments , the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals are moving into better balance ."
" Nonetheless,  fully restoring price stability may take a cautious approach to easing monetary policy over time."
 Congress has given the Federal Reserve ’s monetary policymakers a mandate and the independence with which to pursue it.

" Benefits of Maximum Employment  I gave a speech last fall that described the evolution of the Federal Reserve’s employment mandate .4  I discussed  how leaders of the civil rights movement, including Coretta Scott King, identified unemployment as a pernicious factor holding back disadvantaged communities and people ."
King wisely noted that “unemployment lies at the root of all our major social problems .”5  Economists also understand that high unemployment has painful consequences for individual workers and their families.
  High levels of employment are key to a vibrant  economy.
" It means that a vital resource is being used most productively , resulting in a larger and more prosperous  2 Before  the 1977 amendment to the Federal Reserve Act, maximum employment was already a legislated goal, applying to the whole of the federal government, through the Employment Act of 1946."
" One of the Employment Act’s additional legislated goals, maximum purchasing power, had been interpreted as amounting to a price -stability goal."
" 3 The 1977 amendment called on monetary policy “ to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and  moderate long -term interest rates ”; quoted text from the Federal Reserve Act is in 12 U.S.C. § 225a (2000), https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/section2a.htm ."

" Maximum employment promotes business investment, boosting productivity and the economy’s long -run growth potential."
" Benefits of Price Stability  Now let  us consider the purpose of the other part of our mandate, price stability, by which I mean low inflation.7  Former Federal Reserve Chair Alan Greenspan once said, “Price stability is that state in which expected changes in the general price level do not effectively alter business or household decisions .”8  He meant that w hen households and businesses can reasonably expect inflation to remain low and stable, they are able to make sound decisions regarding saving, borrowing, and investment, thereby  contribut ing  6 See Lisa D."
"Romer (1986), “Increasing Returns and Long -Run Growth,” Journal of Political Economy,  vol."
"  Low and stable inflation reduces uncertainty about future prices and business conditions, promoting a favorable environment for investment in productive capacity and human potential."
" Price stability means avoid ing periods of high inflation, which are a particular burden on those who are disadvantaged and least able to bear it."
 The costs of inflation were described  by many community members in the Fed Listens  events that the Federal Reserve has held  in the past couple of years .
" If inflation fluctuates a lot, it may require a more forceful  monetary policy response , and the process of reining in inflation  can contribute to bouts of higher unemployment."
" In contrast, price stability provides a background against which employment can rise more steadily , which  is why well -anchored inflation expectations are so important."
" Price Stability:  Evolution  and International Comparisons  While  the Fed has considered  price stability a key objective for its entire 110 -year history and the 1977 amendment made  price  stability  an official  goal in the Federal Reserve Act , a specific numerical objective for inflation is a relatively recent development ."
" The breakthrough came i n January 2012, when the monetary policymakers who make up the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) stated that they judge that inflation of 2  percent over the longer run, as measured by the annual change in the price index f or personal consumption expenditures  (PCE) , is most consistent with the Federal Reserve’s mandate of maximum employment and price stability."
" - 5 -  There were a few reasons to set an inflation of target of 2  percent , rather than zero.9  Near -zero inflation can slide  into sustained deflation, which is often associated with significant job losses, and debt burdens increase when prices are falling."
  A positive inflation target also allows the central bank more room to adjust its nominal policy rate to achieve a real interest rate sufficiently negative to provide stimulus during economic downturns.
" Maximum Employment:  Evolution and International Comparisons  Although other advanced -economy central banks do not have a dual mandate like the Fed, most of them explicitly or implicitly consider employment or economic activity in their setting of monetary policy."
" Statutorily, employment is often a secondary mandate  to price stability."
" Functionally, the se other central banks tend to describe the outlook for employment as affecting the speed with which they attempt to return inflation to their target."
" For instance, if there is a shock that raises inflation above the target at a time when the unemployment rate is also high, such a central bank would tighten policy less than if its only objective was to move inflation back to that target as quickly as possible."
  This way of operationalizing inflation targeting implies that there is a significant  weight on employment in monetary policy decisions.
"  9 One reason  is possible upward bias in measures of inflation, having to do with substitution, quality adjustments , and the introduction of new products."
" In addition, the downward rigidity of nominal wages (and some prices) implies that a pos itive inflation target allows more scope for adjustment of relative prices needed to send price signals in the economy."
" - 6 -  In the case of the United States, t he difference is that Congress made the Fed’s employment mandate more explicit ."
" Employment was always mentioned as an objective of the Fed, but the 1977 amendment to the Federal Reserve Act made it part of the main U.S. law applying to monetary policy ."
The Fed has not set a numerical target for its mandate of maximum employment.
 The unemployment rate is a key variable in evaluating progress toward that goal.
" Economists have a concept of the natural rate of unemployment, sometimes call ed u*, defined as  the rate of unemployment compatible with a steady inflation rate ."
 The aggregate unemployment rate is also not the only consideration in determining whether we are meeting our maximum -employment goal.
 Monetary Policy Tradeoffs  How should we think about the tradeoff between our two goals?
 There is no longrun tradeoff that monetary policy can exploit.
 Monetary policy is generally thought to be able to control inflation  over the long run .
" In contrast,  the maximum level of employment depends on structural forces and economic policies beyond the influence of monetary policy ."
 This is particularly true in the presence of demand shocks.
" For instance, a negative demand shock in the economy will tend to raise unemployment and also put downward pressure - 7 -  on inflation."
" In this case, both mandates suggest a need for monetary stimulus to increase demand in the economy, bring down unemployment , and keep inflation from falling significantly below target."
" However, a negative supply shock (like a rise in oil prices) will tend to increase both inflation and unemployment  at first , which  creates a short -run tradeoff for monetary policy ."
" Stimulus to bring down unemployment could push inflation  even higher , but responding aggressive ly to inflation may have significant employment costs."
"  The FOMC lays out our approach to this potential tradeoff in its annual Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy , which  says the following :  The Committee’s  employment and inflation objectives are generally complementary."
" However, under circumstances in which the Committee judges that the objectives are not complementary, it takes into account the employment shortfalls and inflation deviations and the potent ially different time horizons over which employment and inflation are projected to return to levels judged consistent with its mandate.10 In 2022 and into 2023, with unemployment near historical lows but inflation at its highest level in four decades, it was clear that this approach to meeting the dual mandate implied forceful tightening of monetary policy ."
" More recently, with inflation having fallen s ubstantial ly, even as the labor market has remained strong, it is worth considering how economic developments may have shifted policy tradeoffs and associated risks."
 Inflation Indicators  How do we evaluate whether we are meeting our dual -mandate goals?
" Starting with inflation, we look at the 12 -month change in the PCE price index, which rose to more than 7 percent in mid -2022 (slide 1 )."
" As economies around the world gradually  10 See paragraph 6 of the Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, which is available on the Board’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomc_longerrungoals.pdf ."
"- 8 -  reopened after pandemic -related shutdowns, demand picked up, especially for goods."
" But supply chains were slower to recover, leading to a global surge in inflation."
" That surge was followed by a further upswing in inflation after February 2022, when Russia's invasion of Ukraine reduced  global supplies of commodities, including oil and natural gas, food , and fertilizers."
" Since then, supply bottlenecks have eased, labor supply has recovered robustly, and aggregate demand has been dampened  by higher interest rates and the end of pandemic -era fiscal support."
" With supply and demand coming into better balance, PCE inflation has retreated , reaching 2.4 percent in January."
"  Because monetary policy affects  the real economy , or the part of the economy that involves producing goods and services,  with a lag and affects  inflation with an even longer lag, monetary policy must be forward -looking."
" Th erefore , we look at measures that may provide better guides to the direction of future inflation ."
" One such measure is core inflation (excluding food and energy prices , which tend to be volatile )."
" Core inflation rose less sharply than overall inflation but has also moved down a bit less,  to 2.8 percent in January."
" To understand how inflation has evolved in recent years, we can look at its components (slide 2 )."
 Food and energy prices helped drive the rise in inflation following the shocks from the pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
" Inflation in these two volatile categories has slowed considerably since 2022 as supply constraints have eased, although the level of grocery prices (in particular) remains elevated, which is a burden on many households."
" - 9 -  Among components of core inflation, core goods prices were most affected by supply bottlenecks and the shift toward  more  goods consumption during the pandemic."
" Core goods inflation also has slowed most appreciably over the past two years, returning recently to its pre -pandemic trend of prices falling moderately."
" Shortages of computer chips used as components sharply curtailed automobile producti on, even as consumer demand for autos rose amid reduced usage of public transportation."
" Prices of core services excluding housing did not rise as dramatical ly as goods, but inflation in those services has also not come down as quickly ."
 That partly reflected  strong demand as households resumed their consumption of in -person services like travel and dining.
 T he surge in work ing from home increase d demand for larger  homes  and those  located in less expensive metro areas or further from city centers.
" Because these shifts in demand happened much more rapidly than the response in housing supply, rents increased quite notably , especially for single -family detached homes."
" Initially, n ew and existing homeowners were able to lock in historically low long -term mortgage rates, which also drove up the demand for housing."
" Although housing -services inflation remains  quite high, t he current low rate of increase  on new rental leases suggests that it will continue to fall ."
"The public’s expectations of future inflation affect spending decisions today and in the near term, and , therefore,  also influence current inflation."
 The Federal Reserve  looks at a range of indicators of inflation expectations .
" Surveys of inflation expectations among consumers and businesses can be informative, as are market -based measures such as those from inflation -indexed Treasury securities  (slide 4) ."
 Shorter -run expectations rose through early 2022 amid uncerta inty about the ultimate level and persistence of inflation .
" The sharp monetary policy tightening that began in the spring of 2022 likely helped rein in those expectations , which have since fallen to near pre -pandemic levels,  and kept longer -run inflation expectations  from rising  above  the range observed over the couple of decades  before  the pandemic ."
" But, certainly, a key indicator in  evaluat ing the strength of the labor market  is the unemployment rate , which has remained near historic al lows even as the Fed has tightened  policy and inflation has come down  (slide 5 )."
 The rebound in immigration  from the lows recorded during the pandemic  has boosted growth in the working -age population.
 And the wage growth differential between job switchers and those staying in their jobs has narrowed.11   Comprehensive measures of wage growth also show gradual cooling.
" Notably, the employment cost index for the private sector rose 4.1 percent on a 12 -month basis in December, down from 5.1 percent over the previous 12 months  but still well above the pace in the years before the pandemic (slide 9 )."
"To some extent, this elevated wage growth is catching up to the previous surge in inflation."
 Whether wage growth at these levels is associated with  upward pressure on inflation depends importantly on trends in labor productivity  and on whether firms allow their profit margins to fall .
" If productivity growth is strong, that is, if more output can be produced with fewer inputs, a faster pace of wage growth need not be inflationary."
" Nonetheless, an important part of the strong supply response last year was labor productivity growth , which was  a robust 2."
 The recent surge in measured productivity may reflect a few factors .
" One is that labor  market churn during the earlier stages of this expansion  may have moved workers to higher -paying, more   11 Data are from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta ’s Wage Growth Tracker ."
"- 13 -  productive jobs.12  Another possible factor is that t he rise in new businesses since the pandemic may increase innovation over time.13   Looking ahead, I see artificial intelligence (AI) as a potentially significant source of productivity growth ."
" The Balance of Risks for Monetary Policy  Taking all these inflation and labor market indicators together,  and as noted in the most recent FOMC statement, the risks to achieving our inflation and employment goals are moving into better balance."
 The risk of easing monetary policy too much or too soon is that it could allow above -target inflation to become entrenched and halt the progress that we have seen.
" That would ultimately require more -restrictive monetary policy to wring more -persistent inflation out of the economy, at a potentially high cost to employment."
"  The path of disinflation, as expected, has been bumpy  and uneven , but a careful approach to further policy  12 See David Autor, Arindrajit Dube, and Annie McGrew (2023), “The Unexpected Compression:  Competition at Work in the Low Wage Labor Market,” NBER Working Paper Series 31010 (Cambridge, Mass.:  National Bureau of Economic Research, March; revised November 2 023), https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w31010/w31010.pdf ."
