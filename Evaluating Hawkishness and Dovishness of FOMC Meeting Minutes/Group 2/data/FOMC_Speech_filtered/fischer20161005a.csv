"For release on delivery  7:15 p.m. EDT  October 5 , 2016         Low Interest Rates     Remarks by   Stanley Fischer   Vice Chair man  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at the  40th Annual Central Banking Seminar, sponsored by  the Federal Reserve Bank of New York   New York , New York         October 5, 2016    I would like to thank the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for establishing this seminar 40 years ago and for maintaining it since  then ."
" This seminar has  also fostered a stronger sense of community among  central banks , whose interactions undergird the global financial system.1 I will talk today about an issue that currently confronts almost all central banks :  historically low interest rates."
" Ultralow interest rates have not been limited to the short end of the yield curve, which is most directly affected by monetary policy."
 Figure 2 shows that longer -term interest rates --which embed market participants ’ expectations of where real short -term rates and inflation are likely to be in the future --have also been exceptionally low .
" The low interest rate environment presents us with four key questions :  (1) Are ultralow interest rates part of the so -called new  normal for the global economy , or are they mostly transitory?"
"  (2) How concerned should we be, if at all, about the current interest rate environment ?"
 (3) What determines the level of interest rates over the longer run?
 ( 4) What can policymakers do about chronically low interest rates?
 The fact that interest rates have remain ed so low in the U nited  States over the past eight years --well into the recovery from the severe strains of the G reat Recession --suggests that ultralow rates may reflect more than just cyclical forces.
  - 2 - a simple observation that illustrates this point:  The unemployment rate in the United States has dropped from a peak of 10 percent in the aftermath of the Great Recession to just 4.9 percent today.
" Yet, over the same period, yields on nominal and inflationindexed 10year U.S. Treasury securities have fallen around 180 basis points and 140 basis points, respectively."
"  Knut Wicksell, the great Swedish economist , emphasized the concept of an equilibrium level of interest rates in his influential work ."
" In his 1898 book, Interest and Prices, he wrote that “there is a certain level of the average rate of interest which is such that the general level of prices has no tendency to move either upwards or downwards.”2  In modern language, this level of the interest rate i s usually referred to as the natural rate of interest."
" Applying Wicksell’s insights to the circumstances we face today, the fact that both inflation and interest rates have remained very low over the past several years suggests that our current interest r ate environment may well reflect, at least in part, a very low level of the natural rate of interest."
"    If we knew the natural rate precisely, conduct ing monetary policy  would be relatively straightforward."
" Central bankers could easily assess their  policy stance --which could be measured, for instance, as the difference between actual and natural interest rates --and adjust it as needed."
" If only life were that simple!  In reality, given that the natural rate of interest cannot be directly observed, W icksell  proposed that the central bank follow a simple interest rate rule."
"  - 3 - monetary policy should be to pursue price stability, a modern interpretation of Wicksell’s rule would suggest that the central bank should raise the interest rate if inflation is  above target and reduce the interest rate if inflation is  below target.3  When inflation stabilized, the central bank would know that the interest rate w as at its natural level."
" In principle , this method could be extended to a reaction function that included both an inflation and a maximumemployment objective for the central bank, as is  the case for the Federal Reserve."
 One prominent example of this approach is the work of my Federal  Reserve colleagues Thomas Laubach and John Williams .4   Laubach and Williams  estimate d the natural rate in a small -scale Keynesian model where inflation responds to the gap between actual and potential gross domestic product (GDP) and economic activity is determined b y a simple equation that links deviations of actual from potential GDP to the gap between actual and natural interest rates.
" In their model, as in  Wicksell’s framework, inflation generally will rise if the interest rate is low relative to the natural rate  and fall if the interest rate is high relative to the natural rate."
"  Their empirical results point to the growth rate of potential GDP as an important determinant of the natural rate of interest, a topic that I will discuss shortly."
"                                                  3 Wicksell’s proposed rule was based on the price level  rather than inflation:  “So long as prices remain unaltered the banks’ rate of interest is to be raised; and if prices fall, the rate of interest is to be lowered; and the rate of interest is henceforth to be maintained at its new level until a further movement of prices calls fo r a further change in one direction or the other” (Wicksell, 1936, p."
"  - 4 - In a recent update to their work --cowritten with another Federal Reserve colleague, Kathryn Holston-- Laubach and Williams report that , for the U nited States  as well as other advanced economies , estimates of the natural  rate have fallen since the late 1990s , with particularly large declines following the global financial crisis.5  Their results --summarized in f igure 3 --support the informal assessment that chronically low interest rates could well be , at least in part,  the result of very low natural interest r ates and not just a consequence of the cyclical state of the economy."
" Second, there is an effective lower bound for nominal interest rates (and, consequently , for the  actual real rate)."
" Because currency is a government obligation that pays a nominal interest rate of zero and , instead of buying government bills or bonds at a negative interest rate, one can always hold currency.6   To see why these two simple observations can be so consequential, we need only go back to the work of another great economist from the past."
 6 It has turned out in practice that nominal interest rates can dip (and have dipped) into negative territory.
 This fact means that the lower bound on the nominal interest rate is below zero to an extent that depends on the full costs of holding wealth in the form of currency.
" Hence,  the term we now use in the Fed eral Reserve is not the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates , but rather the effective lower bound, which may well be less than zero."
" - 5 - General Theory , this co ntrast between equilibrium and actual interest rates was at the heart of the so -called  liquidity trap, a situation where the equilibrium interest rate is so low that even a zero (or slightly negative) nominal interest rate is not low enough to stimulate ec onomic activity.7  Keynes’ s bottom line was that, when the economy falls into the liquidity trap,  traditional monetary policy  loses its effectiveness and fiscal policy has to be used for countercyclical stabilization."
" And here lies the  first reason why we should be concerned about chronically low interest rates :  When the equilibrium interest rate is very low, the economy is more likely to fall into the liquidity trap ; it becomes more vulnerable to adverse shocks that might render conventiona l monetary policy ineffective."
" Of course, as we have all learned over the past several years, unconventional monetary policy tools developed and used since the Great Recession-- such as large -scale asset purchases and extended forward guidance--have signifi cantly mitigated concerns about the liquidity trap.8  Nonetheless, the question of whether unconventional tools are perfect substitutes for cutting short -term interest rates remains a topic of active research.9 Let me briefly mention a second reason for wo rrying about ultralow interest rates :  The transition to a world with a very low natural rate of interest  may h urt financial stability  by causing investors to reach for yield, and some financial institutions will find it harder to be profitable ."
" On the wh ole, however, the evidence to date does not point to notable risks to financial stability stemming from ultralow interest rates."
" For instance, economic theory --along with some empirical evidence --suggests  that real interes t rates and the growth of real GDP tend to move together over the long run.10  Thus, a decline in longer -run equilibrium real rates --as suggested by my observations today and by the careful work of Laubach and Williams --could be yet another indication that the economy’s growth potential may have dimmed considerably."
" This deeply concerning conjecture --which suggests that the slowdown of productivity growth that we have experienced in recent years could be long lasting --has played an important role in Larry S ummers’ s revival of the “secular stagnation” hypothesis.11 Given what a fall in the natural rate of interest might mean for economic performance for years to come, we should reflect on the forces that may have caused that decline--my third question--and on what, if anything, can be done to reverse them --my fourth and last question."
"  Ultimately, the level of the natural interest rate reflects businesses ’, households ’, and governments’ saving and investment decisions over the medium to longer run."
" Indeed, the savinginvestment channel provides a useful framework for thinking about  the relationship between the natural rate and the growth rate of potential GDP."
" For instance, a lasting slowing in the pace of technological innovation--a key determin ant of potential growth --may result in fewer profitable opportunities for businesses, which could                                                  10 See Laubach and Williams (2003)."
" If persistent , this slowing in the growth rate of potential GDP --and the resulting combination of lower investment and higher saving propensities --would put downward pressure on the n atural rate of interest."
" Recent studies point to trends that may have had a sizable and lasting effect on the balance between saving and  investment at the macro  level.13  Some of these trends may have worked more directly on the demand for investment goods , whereas others may have had a more direct bearing on saving."
" Potential factors that others have mentioned as having contributed to reduced investment in physical capital include heightened economic uncertainty in the aftermath of the Great Recession and the lower physical capital needs of many of today’s growing firms, particularly information technology firms.14  On the saving side, some  researchers have noted that high  saving rates in some emerging  market countries, combined with a lack of suitable domestic investment opportunities in those countries, may have put downward pressure on interest rates in advanced economies.15  Others have r aised the possibility                                                  12 A lasting slow ing in the pace of technological innovation may also help explain the significant decline in the past 10 years in the growth rate of total factor productivity  (TFP), the portion of productivity that is not accounted f or by measurable inputs to production --see Fischer (2016) ."
" The available data suggest that, compared with reduced business investment, the decline in TFP growth accounts for a larger share of the slowing in the growth rate of potential GDP in recent years  and, thus, may also be an important factor behind the decline in the natural rate of interest."
"  - 8 - that the trauma associated with the Great Recession may have contributed to a persistent increase in precautionary saving and greater demand for safe and liquid assets.16  Thus, both increased saving and reduced investment have potenti ally driven the sizable decline in the natural rate of interest."
" If some of the forces behind these shifts prove to be quite persistent, then we could be stuck in a new longer -run equilibrium characterized by sluggish growth and recurrent reliance on unco nventional monetary policy."
" Monetary and fiscal policies could ameliorate some, though not all, of the potential causes of ultralow rates --such as excessive precautionary saving and weak demand for physical capital ."
" In other words, ultralow interest rates are not necessarily  here to stay, especially if the right policies are put in place to address at least some of their root causes."
" Without them , we probably would have had a more pronounced increase in precautionary saving and a deeper decline in fixed investment, which together would have put additional downward pressure on the natural rate of interest and, more important, further damaged the economy’s growth potential."
"But, second, t he virtues of sound monetary policy notwithstanding , we must not forget, as former Fed Chair man Ben Bernanke reminded us on numerous occasions, that “monetary policy is not a panacea.”17  For instance, as I mentioned recently elsewhere,                                                  16 See Haldane (2015) and Lo and Rogoff (2015)."
"  - 9 - policies  to boost productivity growth and the longer -run potential of t he economy are more likely to be found in effective fiscal and regulatory measures than in central bank actions.18  Some combination of improved public infrastructure, better education, more encouragement for private investment, and more -effective regulatio n is likely to promote  faster growth, which would increase the natural rate of interest and, thus, reduce the probability that we may find ourselves again struggling to avoid Keynes’ s infamous liquidity trap."
