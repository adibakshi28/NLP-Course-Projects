"For release on delivery  Noon EDT  May 30, 2019 Sustaining Maximum Employment and Price Stability Remarks by Richard H."
monetary policy.
"  The Federal Reserve has a specific mandate assigned to it in statute by the Congress , whic h is the dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability."
" My colleagues and I understand that our responsibility is to conduct a mone tary policy that not only is supportive of and consistent with achieving maximum employment and price stability, but  also, once achieved, is appropriate, nimble, and consistent with sustain ing maximum employment and price stability for as long as                                                  1 The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of other Federal Reserve Board members or Federal Open Market Committee participants."
" And thus , the title of my talk today is “Sustaining Maximum Employment and Price Stability.”   Midway through the second quarter of 2019, the U.S. economy is in a good place ."
" Over the past four quarters, gross domestic product ( GDP ) growth has averaged 3.2 percent , which compares with an average growth rate of 2.3 percent since the recovery began in the summer of 2009."
" By most estimates, fiscal policy played an important role in boosting growth in 2018, and I expect that fiscal poli cies will continue to support growth in 2019."
" Over the same four  quarter s, the unemployment rate has averaged 3.8  percent , and the most recent reading, at 3.6 percent, is near its lowest level in 50 years ."
" Wages have been rising broadly in line with productivity and prices  and thus , at present , do not signal rising cost -push pressure."
" Notwithstanding strong growth and l ow unemployment, U.S. inflation remains muted —currently , it is somewhat below our 2 percent longer -run objective for the personal consumption expenditures ( PCE) price deflator —and inflation expectations , according to a variety of measures, continue to be stable."
"  As we l ook ahead, in our March  Summary of Economic Projections, the median projection of Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) participant s was for  GDP growth of around 2 percent as the modal, or most likely, outcome  over the next three  years , for PCE inflation to  rise to 2  percent , and for  the unemployment rate to edge up to 3.9 percent by 2021."
"   - 3 - Before I discuss the outlook for monetary policy, allow me to review some important structural changes that have taken place in the economy over the pas t decade that will be particularly relevant for our monetary policy decisions."
"Economy:  Demand and Supply  Perhaps the  most significant  structural change relevant to monetary policy is that  the real , or inflationadjusted, rate of interest consistent with full employment and price stability, often referred to as  the neutral rate, or  r*, appear s to have fallen in th e United States and abroad from more than 2 percent before the crisis to less than 1 percent today.3  The decline in neutral policy rates likely reflects several factors, including aging populations , higher private saving, a greater demand for safe assets, and a slowdown in global productivity growth."
" Such a  development, in turn, could make it  more difficult during a future downturn for monetary policy to provide sufficient accommodation to rapidly return employment and inflation to mandate -consistent levels.4   Another  important potential change in the U .S."
"economy has been the steady decline in estimates of the struc tural rate of unemployment  consistent with “maximum” employment , often referred to as u*."
" 4 For assessments of the risks that U.S. monetary policy will be constra ined by the effective lower bound  and its implications for economic activity and inflation, see Kiley and Roberts (2017), Erceg and others (2018), Swanson  (2018), and Chung and others (2019)."
"  - 4 - educational attainment and a larger proportion of older workers in the workforce today relative to the workforce of past decades.5  If u* is lower than historical estimates suggest , this would imply that, even with today’s historically  low unemploym ent rate, the labor market would not be as tight —and inflationary pressures would not be as strong —as one would expect , base d on historical estimates of u*."
  I also note that t he decline in the unemployment rate in recent years has been accompanied by a pronounced increase in labor force participation for individuals in their prime  working years.6  It has also been accompanied since 2014 by a rise in labor ’s share of national income .
" As I  have documented previously, in the past several U.S. business cycles, labor’ s share has risen as those expansions  proceeded  because workers command higher wages in a stronger labor market ; notably,  in those cycles, the rise in labor’s share did not pass through to faster price inflation.7  The previously mentioned increase  in prim eage labor force participation ha s provided employers with a source of additional labor input and has been one factor restraining inflationary  pressures."
"productivity growth, albeit from the very depressed average pace that prevailed                                                  5 More -educated workers and older workers both have lower struct ural unemployment rates, at least historically ; see Aaronson, Hu, Seifoddini, and Sullivan (2015)."
" 6 The box “ The Labor Force Participation Rate for Prime -Age Individuals ” in the Board’s July 2018 Monetary Policy Report  contains a discussion of recent developments in labor force participation rates for prime -age individuals; see Board of Governors (2018, pp."
"7 For more on labor’s share of national income and price inflation, see Clarida (2014, 2016)."
" Indeed, as of the first quarter  of this year , productivity in the nonfarm business sect or rose 2.4 percent over the previous four  quarters , its fastest pace since 2010 when the U .S."
" By contrast, in both the 2001–07 and 1982–90 economic expansions, productivity growth was actually slowing relative to its average pace  during those expansions ."
" That said, while identifying  inflection points in trend productivity growth in real time is notoriously difficult, a pickup in trend productivity growth relative to the pace that prevailed earlier in the expansion is  a possibility that we should not, I believe, dismiss.8  Another structural change  relevant for monetary policy is that price inflation  appears less responsive to resource slack than it did in the past."
" That is, the short -run price Phillips curve appears to have flattened, implying a change in the dynamic relationship between inflation  and employment.9  A flatter Phillips curve is, in a sense, a proverbial double -edged sword."
" It permits the Federal Reserve to support employment more aggressively during downturns —as was the case during and after the Great Recession —because a sustained i nflation breakout is less likely when the Phillips curve is flatter.10  However, a flatter Phillips curve also increases the cost, in terms of economic output, of reversing unwelcome increases in longer -run inflation expectations."
" Thus, a                                                  8 For more on productivity growth, see Brynjolfss on, Rock, and Syverson (forthcoming) ."
"10 One potential contributor to the flattening of the Phillips curve is a change in the conduct of monetary policy since the 1980s toward greater stabilization of inflation and economic activity; for evidence of such a cha nge, see Clarida, Galí, and Gertler (2000);  Boivin and Giannoni (2006) ; and Boivin, Kiley, and Mishkin (2010 )."
" Similarly, the adoption of an explicit inflation objective, along with greater certainty regarding the conduct of monetary policy, can help anchor longer -term inflation expectations and stabilize actual inflation in response to shocks."
"  - 6 - flatter Phillips curve makes it all the more important that longerrun inflation expectations remain anchored at levels consistent with our 2 percent inflation objective.11 Textbook macroeconomic s teaches us that understanding the economy and getting monetary policy right  requires that we do our best to understand if —and if so , how —the forces of aggregate demand and supply are evolving relative to historical experience and the predictions of our models."
" While predicting the future is difficult , with available data  it appea rs that in 2018 and in the first quarter of 2019, the supply side of the economy—employment, participation, and productivity—expanded faster than most forecasters outside and inside the Fed expected."
" Notwithstanding robust growth in demand over these five quarters, PCE price inflation fell somewhat short of the Fed’s 2 percent objective."
" With this background, let me now turn to the outlook for U.S. monetary policy."
" Monetary Policy  As I mentioned earlier, my colleagues and I on the FOMC understand that our priority today is to put in place policies that will help sustain  maximum  employment and price stability in an economy that appears to be operating close to both of our dual -mandat e objectives."
" In our most recent statements, we have indicated that “the                                                  11 See Yellen (2015) for a discussion of inflation dynamics and monetary policy , and see  Erceg  and others (2018) for a quantitative exploration of the monetary policy implications of a flat Phillips curve in an uncertain economic environment."
" Since the mid1980s, movements in both realized inflation and measures of longer -term inflation expectatio ns have been somewhat muted, complicating the task of extracting the precise role of inflation expectations as a determinant of realized inflation."
 Faust and Wright (2013) review the literature on inflation forecasting and present evidence in support of t he conclusion that measures of inflation expectations help predict the trend in inflation.
" Cecchetti and others (2017) show that while the level of realized inflation and four -quarter -ahead inflation expectations are positively correlated, changes in these variables have been largely uncorrelated since the mid -1980s."
" These authors suggest that, in a low and stable inflation environment, policymakers should pay attention to a wide array of other indicators in determining the implications of movements in re alized inflation and measures of inflation expectations."
 I believe that the path for the federal funds rate should be data dependent in two distinct ways.13  Monetary policy should be data dependent in the sense that incoming data reveal at any point in time where the economy is relative to the ultimate objectives of price stability and maximum employment.
 This information on where the economy is relative to  the goals of monetary policy is an important input into interest ra te feedback rules .
" As a result, in the real world, monetary policy should be —and in the United States, I believe , is—data dependent in a second sense:  Policymakers should and do study incoming data and use models to extract signals that enable them to update and improve estimates of r* and u*."
" Consistent with my earlier discussion, in the Summary of Economic Proje ctions, FOMC participants have, over the past seven years, repeatedly revised down their estimates of both u* and r* as unemployment fell and real interest rates remained well below previous  estimates of neutral without the rise in inflation those earlier estimates would have predicted."
"  In addition to u* and r*, another important input into any monetary policy assessment is the state of inflation expectations."
" Indeed, I believe price stability requires that not only actual inflation be centered at our 2 percent objective , but also that expected inflation be equal to our 2 percent inflation objective."
" Unlike r ealized inflation, i nflation expectations themselves are not directly observable; they must be inferred from econometric models, market prices, and surveys  of households and firms ."
" As I assess the totality of the evidence, I judge that , at present , indica tors suggest that longer -term inflation  expectations sit at the low end of a range that I consider consistent with our price -stability mandate."
" As I already noted, the U.S. economy is in a very good place, with the unemployment rate near  a 50year low, inf lationary pressures muted, expected inflation stable, and GDP growth solid and projected to remain so."
"Moreover, the federal funds rate is now in the range of estimates of its longer -run neutral level, and the unemployment  rate is not far below many estimates of u*."
" Mos t recently, the Committee judged at our May meeting that the  current stance of policy remains appropriate, and that decision reflects our view that some of the softness in recent inflation data will prove to be transitory."
" This judgment aligns with some private -sector forecasts, which now project PCE inflation to return to 2 percent  by 2020."
" However, if the incoming data were to show a persistent shortfall in inflation  - 9 - below our 2 percent objective or were it to indicate that global economic and financia l developments present a material downside risk to our baseline outlook, then these are developments that the Committee would take into account  in assessing the appropriate stance for monetary policy ."
"Monetary Policy Implementation and Balance Sheet  Decis ions  Since the beginning of the year, the FOMC has made several important decisions about how  it will implement monetary policy and how it will conclude the process of normalizing the size of its balance sheet."
" The FOMC decided at its January  meeting to  continue to implement monetary policy in a regime with an ample supply of reserves —a reg ime often referred to as a floor system.14  Such a system, which has been in place since late 2008, does not require the active management of reserves through daily open market operations."
" The FOMC continues to view the target range for the federal funds rate as its primary means of adjusting and communicating the stance of monetary policy , although in doing so, w e must and do take into account how our balance sheet size,                                                  14 For information on m onetary policy implementation and balance sheet normalization, s ee Board of Governors (2019a) ."
15 The offered rate on the Overnight Reverse Repo Facility is an additional administered rate used to control the level of the federal fund rate.
" And as we stated in January, a lthough adjustments in the target  range for the federal funds rate are our  primary tool for  adjust ing the stance of monetary policy, we are prepared to adjust  the details of the plans for balance sheet normalization based on economic and financial developments ."
" When the process of normalizing the size of our balance sheet concludes in September , we expect that our reserves liabilities w ill, for a time , likely remain  somewhat above the level necessary for an efficient and effective implementation of  monetary policy."
"  - 11 - monetary policy, we  plan to resume periodic  open market operations to accommodate the normal trend growth in the demand for our liabilities.17    As balance sheet normalizati on has progressed, the effective federal funds rate has firmed relative to the IOER rate ."
"  Review of Monetary Policy Strategy, Tools, and Communications  Before I conclude my prepared remarks, allow me to say a few words about our  review of our monetary policy strategy, tools, and communication practices .18  While we believe that our existing approach to conducting monetary policy has served the public well,  the purpose of this review is to evaluate and assess possible refinements that might help us best achieve our dual -mandate objectives on a sustained basis."
" With the U.S. economy operating at or close to our maximum -employment and price -stability goals, now is an especially opportune time to conduct this  review."
" We want to ensure that we are well positioned to continue to meet our statutory goals in                                                  17 In contrast to the Federal Reserve’s large -scale asset purchases conducted over recent years, these periodic technical open market operations would not have any implication for the stance of monetary policy; rather, such operations would be aimed at maintaining a level of reserve balances in the banking system consistent with effici ent and effective policy implementation."
" Building on both  the perspectives we hear and staff analysis, the FOMC will conduct its own assessment of its monetary policy framework, beginning around the middle of the year."
 What I can say is that any refinements or morematerial changes to our framework that we might ma ke will be aimed solely at enhancing our ability to achieve and sustain our dual -mandate objectives of maximum employment and stable prices.
