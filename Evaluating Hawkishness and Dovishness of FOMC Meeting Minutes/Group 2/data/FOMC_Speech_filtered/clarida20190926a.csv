"EDT (8:45 a.m. local time)  September 26, 2019          The Federal Reserve’s Review of Its Monetary Policy Strategy,  Tools, and Communication Practices     Remarks by   Richard H ."
"Clarida   Vice Chair   Board of Governors of  the Federal Reserve System   at  “A Hot Economy:   Sustainability and Trade -Offs,” a Fed Listens  event sponsor ed by  the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco   San Francisco, California         September 26, 2019    I am delighted to be in San Francisco today to participate in this Fed Listens  conference, “A Hot Economy:  Sustainability and Trade -Offs,” which  is one of a series of events associated with the Federal Reserve’s 2019 review of our monetary policy strategy , tools, and communication practices.1 Motivation for the Review  Although I will have more to say about the review in a moment, let  me state at the outset that we believe our existing framework , which has been in place since 2012, has served us well and has enabled us to achieve and sustain our statutorily assigned goals of maximum employment and price stability."
" However, we also believe now is a good time to step back and assess whether, and in what possible ways, we can refine o ur strategy, tools, and communication practices to achieve and maintain our goals as consistently and robustly as possible.2 With the U.S. economy operating at or close to maximum employment and price stability, now is an especially opportune time to conduct this review."
" The unemployment  rate is near a 50 -year low, and inflation is running close to our 2 percent objective."
" Perhaps most significantly, neutral interest rates appear to have                                                  1 These remarks represent my own views, which do not necessarily represent those of the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee."
 2 Fuhrer and others (2018) explore the desirability of comprehensive reviews of the monetary policy framework.
" That development, in turn, could make it more difficult during downturns for monetary  policy to support spending and employment and to keep inflation from falling too far  below the 2 percent objective.4 Another key development in recent decades is that price inflation appears  less responsive to resource slack."
" That is, the short -run price Phillips curve —if not the wage Phillips curve —ap pears to have flattened, implying a change in the dynamic relationship between inflation and employment.5  A flatter Phillips curve permits the Federal Reserve to support employment more aggressively during downturns —as was the case during and after the Great Recession —because a sustained in flation breakout is less likely when the Phillips curve is flatter.6  However, a flatter Phillips curve also increases the cost, in terms of lost economic output, of reversing unwelcome increases in longer -run inflation expectations."
" Thus, a flatter Phill ips curve makes it all the more important that inflation expectations remain anchored at levels consistent with our 2 percent inflation objective.7                                                   3 For evidence of a fall i n neutral rates of interest in the United States and abroad, see, among several contributions, King and Low (2014); Holston, Laubach, and Williams (2017); Rachel and Smith (2017); and Brand, Bielecki, and Penalver (2018)."
" 4 For assessments of the risks tha t U.S. monetary policy will be constrained by the ELB and its implications for economic activity and inflation, see Kiley and Roberts (2017), Erceg and others (2018), Swanson  (2018), and Chung and others (2019)."
" 6 One potential contributor to the flattening of the Phillips curve is a change in the conduct of monetary policy since the 1980s toward greater stabilization of inflation and economic activity; for evidence of such a change, see Clarida, Galí, and Gertler (2000); Boivin and Giannoni (2006); and Boivin, Kiley, and Mishkin (2010)."
" Similarly, the adoption of an explicit inflation ob jective, along with greater certainty regarding the conduct of monetary policy, can help anchor longer -term inflation expectations and stabilize actual inflation in response to shocks."
" 7 See Yellen (2015) for a discussion of inflation dynamics and monetary  policy; see Erceg and others (2018) for a quantitative exploration of the monetary policy implications of a flat Phillips curve in an  - 3 - And let me emphasize that, based on the evidence I have reviewed, I judge that U .S."
inflation expectations today do reside in a range I consider consistent with our pricestability mandate.
" This low unemployment rate, 3.7 percent in August, has been interpreted by many as suggesting that the labor market is currently operating beyond full employment."
" However, we cannot directly observe the level of the unemployment rate that is consistent with full employment and price sta bility , u*, but  must infer it from data via models."
 I myself believe that the range of plausible estimates of u* extends to 4 percent and below and includes the current unemployment rate of 3.7 percent.
" As the unemployment rate has declined in recent yea rs, labor force participation for people in their prime working years has increased significantly, with the August participation rate at a cycle high of 82.6 percent.8  Increased primeage participation has provided employers with additional labor resource s and has been one factor, along with a pickup in labor productivity, restraining inflationary pressures."
" Since the mid -1980s, movements in both realized inflation and measures of longer -term in flation expectations have been somewhat muted, complicating the task of extracting the precise role of inflation expectations as a determinant of realized inflation."
 Faust and Wright (2013) review the literature on inflation forecasting and present eviden ce in support of the conclusion that measures of inflation expectations help predict the trend in inflation.
" Cecchetti and others (2017) showed that while the level of realized inflation and four -quarter -ahead inflation expectations are positively correlated, changes in these variables have been largely uncorrelated since the mid -1980s."
" These authors suggest that, in a low and stable inflation environment, policymakers should pay attention to a wide array of other indicators in determining the implication s of movements in realized inflation and measures of inflation expectations."
" 8 The box “The Labor Force Participation Rate for Prime -Age Individuals” in the Board’s July 2018 Monetary Policy Report  contains a discussion of recent developments in labor forc e participation rates for prime -age individuals; see Board of Governors (2018b, pp."
"Also, although the labor market is robust, there is no evidence that rising wages are putting upward pressure on price inflation."
 Wages today are increasing  broadly i n line with productivity growth and underlying inflation.
data that labor’s share tends to rise as expansions endure and the labor market tightens.9  In recent cycles —and thus far in this cycle —this rise in labor’s share has not put upward pressure on pr ice inflation.
" For example, African  Americans and Hispanics have experienced persistently higher unemployment rates  than whites for many decades.10  However, those unemployment rate gaps have narrowed as the labor market has strengthened, and, as President Daly’s research shows, there is some indication these groups especially benefit when the unemployment rate remains very low.11  Likewise, the gaps between unemployment rates for less -educated workers and their more -educated counterparts appear to narrow as the labor market strengthens.12                                                   9 See Clarida (2016)."
 11 See Aaronson and others (2019) for evidence on the relative behavior of unemployment rates by race and ethnicity in a strong labor market.
 The authors find similar patterns for labor force participation rates and for employment -topopulation ratios.
" The box “Employment Disparities between Rural and Urban Areas” in the Boar d’s February 2019 Monetary Policy Report  examines these disparities in more detail; see Board of Governors (2019, pp."
"  - 5 - Wage increases in the past couple of years have been strongest for less -educated  workers and for those at the lower end of the wage distribution.13 Scope of the Review  The Federal Reserve Act assigns to the Fed the responsibility to conduct  monetary  policy “so as to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate longterm interest rates.”14  Our review this year takes this statutory mandate as given and also takes as given that inflation at a rate of 2 percent is most  consistent over the longer run with the congressional mandate."
" Our existing monetary policy strategy is laid out in the Committee’s Statement  on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy.15  First adopted in January 2012, the  statement indicates that the Committee seeks to mitigate deviations of inflation from 2 percent and deviations of employment from assessments of its maximum level."
" In doing so, the F ederal O pen M arket C ommittee (FOMC)  recognizes that these assessments of maximum employment are nec essarily unce rtain and subject to revision."
"As a practical matter, our current strategy shares  many elements with the policy framework known as “flexible inflation targeting.”16  However, the Fed’s mandate is much more explicit about the role of employment than that of most flexible inflation -                                                 13 Wage gains for workers with different wage levels and with different levels of education can be calculated using data from the Current Population Survey from the Bureau of Labor Statistics."
" 14 Even though the act lists three distinct goals, the Federal Reserve’s mandate for monetary policy is commonly known as the “dual mandate.”  The reason is that an economy in which people who want to work either have a job or are likely to find one fairly quickly and in which the price level (meaning a broad measure of the price of go ods and services purchased by consumers) is stable creates the conditions needed for interest rates to settle at moderate levels."
" Three Questions  The first question is, “Can the Federal Reserve best meet its statutory objectives with its existing monetary policy strategy, or should it consider strategies that aim  to reverse past misses of the inflation objective?”  Under our current approach as well as the approaches of many central banks  around the world, persistent inflat ion shortfalls of the target are treated as “bygones.”   Central banks are generally believed to have effective tools for preventing persistent inflation overshoots, but the ELB on interest rates makes persistent undershoots more of a challenge."
" Persistent  inflation shortfalls  carry the risk that longer -term inflation expectations become anchored below the stated inflation goal.17 In part because of that concern, some economists have advocated “makeup ” strategies under which policymakers seek to undo past inflation deviations from target."
"These strategies include targeting average inflation and price -level targeting, in which policymakers seek to stabilize the price level around a constant growth path.18  Other                                                  17 These risks could be exacerbated  if households and businesses expect monetary policy to be insufficiently accommodative because of proximity to the ELB."
 18 Eggertsson and Woodford (2003) provide an early discussion of how optimal monetary policy at the ELB entails a commitment to reflate the price level during the subsequent economic expansion.
 Nessén and Vestin (2005) discuss the relationship betwee n average inflation targeting and price -level targeting.
 There is a dearth of empirical evidence on strategies seeking to make up for inflation deviations.
" Central banks that pursue an inflation goal generally seek to achieve a specific rate of inflation  by some time horizon — - 7 - makeup strategies seek to reverse shortfalls in p olicy accommodation at the ELB by keeping the policy rate lower for longer than otherwise would be the case.19  In many  models that incorporate the ELB, these makeup strategies lead to better average performance on both legs of the dual mandate.20 The succes s of makeup strategies relies on households and firms believing  in advance that the makeup will, in fact, be delivered when the time comes —for example, that a persistent inflation shortfall will be met by future inflation above 2  percent."
" As is well known from the research literature, makeup strategies, in general, are not time consistent because when the time comes to push inflation above 2 percent, conditions at that time will not justify that action."
" The next question the review will consider is, “Are existing monetary policy  tools adequate to achieve and m aintain maximum employment and price stability, or should                                                  typically a couple of years ahead or over the “medium run” —without regard to past inflation deviations."
" One exception is the Reserve Bank of Australia, whose inflation goal is specified as a range of  “2–3 per  cent, on average, over the medium term” and thus might embed some notion of history dependence."
" However, Ruge -Murcia (2014) argues that the drift in the price level in Australia is comparable with the drifts observed in economies with purely forward -looking specification of the  inflation goal."
 See also Kiley and Roberts (2017) for a strategy in which policymakers aim for inflation higher than 2 percent during economic expansions to compensate for below -target realizations of inflation during economic downturns.
" The box “Complexities of Monetary Policy Rules” in the Board’s July 2018 Monetary Policy Report  contains an application of such a modified rule; see Board of Governors (2018b, pp."
" And, if so, how?”  The FOMC’s primary monetary policy tool is its target range for the federal funds rate."
" These enhancements include the Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy; postmeeting press conferences; various statements about the principles  and                                                  21 As an illustration of the shortfall in policy support created by a binding ELB during the Global Fina ncial Crisis, the simple policy rules considered in a January 2017 speech by then -Chair Janet Yellen prescribed setting the federal funds rate between negative 1 -1/2 and negative 9 percent; see Yellen (2017)."
"  - 9 - strategy guiding the Committee’s normalization of monetary policy; and quarterly summaries of individual FOMC participants’ economic projections, assessments about the appropriate path of the federal funds rate, and judgments of the uncertainty and balance of risks around their projections.22 As part of the review, we will assess the Committee’s current  and past communica tions and additional forms of communication that could be helpful."
" For example, there might be ways to improve communication about the coordination of policy tools or the interplay between monetary policy and financial stability."
" Another panel discussion offered insights into how the monetary levers we pull and push affect communities, credit                                                  22 Starting in 1979, the Federal Reserve published a summary of individual economic projections from various Board members, FOMC member s, or FOMC participants in the semiannual Monetary Policy Report."
" This summer, the FOMC began to assess what we  have learned at the Fed Listens  events and to receive briefings from S ystem staff on topics relevant to the review.24  At our July meeting, FOMC participants agreed that our current framework for monetary policy has served the Committee and the U.S. economy well over the past decade."
" At our July meeting, we also noted that the Committee’s Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy has been helpful in articulating and clarifying the Federal Reserve’s approa ch to monetary policy and agreed that any changes we might make to our strategy would likely call for some modification of th is consensus statement."
" I expect we will consider various topics, such as alte rnative policy strategies, options for enhanced use of existing  monetary policy tools, possible additions to the policy toolkit, potential changes to communication practices, and the relationship between monetary policy and financial                                                  24 See Board of Governors (2019b)."
