"Powell   Member   Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at  “Understanding Fedspeak,”  an event  cosponsored by  the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy  at the Brookings Institution  and the Center for Financial Economics at Johns Hopkins University   Washington, D.C.         November 30, 2016    Thanks to David Wessel and the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy at the Brookings Institution for putting together this event.1  Today I will share my own views on the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) public communications, which are designed to serve three  important purposes ."
 The f irst is to provide the transparency that enables the Congress and the public to hold t he Committee accountable for its decisions on monetary policy.
 The s econd  is to enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy.
" If the public understands the central bank’ s views on the economy and monetary policy, then households and businesses will take those views into account in making their  spending and investment  plans;  policy will be more effective as a result."

" In October 2007, after extensive discussions and internal trial runs , the FOMC published its first Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), which built on the macroeconomic forecasts from the semi annual  Monetary Policy Report  to the Congress ."
" Since then, SEP projections have been expanded to include longer -run values for real gross domestic product growt h, the unemployment rate, headline PCE (personal consumption expenditures) price inflation, and the federal funds rate;  assessments of                                                  4 See Board of Governors of the Fede ral Reserve System (1994), FOMC statement, press release, February  4, paragraph 3, https://www.federalreserve.gov/fomc/19940204default.htm ."
"In January 2012, the Committee first released its Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, which is  reaffirm ed annually ."
" This consensus statement serves as a quasi -constitutional document that clarifies that th e Committee’s inflation objective is 2 percent as measured by the annual change in the PCE price index , that this objective is symmetric , that the maximum level of employment is largely determined by nonmonetary factors affecting the structure and dynamics  of the labor market , and that the Committee will take a balanced approach to promote its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation under circumstances in which the Committee judges that those objectives are not complementary."
" Since September 2010, the minutes have included paragraphs that reflect the views on monetary policy expressed by all meeting participants, not just those who vote on the policy  decision."
" These changes ,                                                  6 The “dot plot” is a figure that provides individual policymaker assessments of appropriate monetary policy as defined by the value of the federal funds rate target or the midpoint of the federal funds rate target range at the end of each calendar year of the SEP forecast."
" However, markets do not appear to be unusually uncertain about FOMC decisions.7 In theory, our communications about monetary policy can be roughly divided into those that express the consensus and those that show the diversity of views."

" - 6 - outlooks, risk assessment s, and objectives.10  The whole forward interest rate curve matters for financial conditions, not just the overnight rate."
" Monetary policy was therefore thought to be made more effective by communication of the full expected path of policy, which could the n be incorporated into private -sector expectations and longer -term interest rates ."
" Indeed, to the extent that the Committee’s talk about the path of policy is given weight, that talk may leave “too little scope for private assessments of economic developments to show through” in market prices .12 Jon notes in his paper that communications about monetary policy generally received high marks from 2008 through early 2013, and he focuses his analysis on the challenging period since mid -2013."

" However, most participants judged that, given the diversity of their views about  the economy ’s structure and dynamics, it would be difficult for the Committee to agree on a fully specified longer -term path for monetary policy to incorporate into a quantitative consensus forecast in a timely manner, especially under present conditions in which the policy decision comprises several elements."
" Since the beginning of 2012, p articipants’ views about the longe rrun annual growth potential of the economy ha ve dropped from 2.45 percent to 1.85 percent  (figure 4).15  Much of the  downward revision in estimates of longer -run potential growth reflect s the implications of demographic trends and the slowdown in producti vity growth.16  These structural factors have also weighed on participants’ assessments of the longer -run neutral federal funds rate--the rate that would be neither expansionary nor contractionary if the economy were operating near its                                                  overnight index swap (OIS) paths are estimated using a spline approach; each line corresponds to the estimated path on the day before the release of SEP projection s."
" 15 Other forecasters --for instance, Blue Chip and the Survey of Professional Forecasters --have also revised down their estimates for longer -run real gross domestic product (GDP) growth."

" In making these comparisons, I use the midpoint of the central tendency for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate."
"Fernald (2015 ), “Productivity and Potential Output befor e, during, and after the Great Recession,” in Jonathan A."
 The persistence of low inflation de spite faster -thanexpected reductions in unemployment has also led participants to lower their estimate s of the longer -run normal unemployment rate ; the median estimate has declined  from 5.60 percent  in January 2012 to 4.85 percent  in September 2016 (figur e 6).
" One way to see that is through the application of a policy rule, such as a Taylor rule.18  Simple policy rules, as they are sometimes called, incorporate key fa ctors for monetary policy , including the natural rate of unemployment, the neutral rate of interest, and deviations of inflation and unemployment from their long -run values."
"Yellen (2015), “The Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy,” speech delivered at t he Economic Club of Washington, Washington, December 2, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/yellen20151202a.htm ."
"19 For example, FRB/US simulations using the Taylor (1993) rule for the period 201015 show substantially higher unemployment and lower inflation than was actually realized."
"   - 10 - The red  solid  line in figure 7 shows the policy prescription using the  original 1993 Taylor rule together with the September SEP dots for the federal funds rate.20  The Taylor rule prescription has been derived using the median value for core PCE price inflation, the unemployment rate, and the longer -run normal unemployment rate from the September 2016 SEP."
The intercept in this Taylor rule represents the longer -run real interest rate --or r* --which is set to 2 percent.
" If we replace that intercept with the median of the  longer -run r* implied by the most recent SEP, which is 0.9 percent, we see that the rule prescribes much lower settings for policy interest rates than the unadjusted rule (the blue dashed  line in figure 7)."
" However, many observers believe that the neutral real interest rate is currently well below  its longer -run value."
" The language that has appeared in the Committee’s postmeeting statement since December 2015 that “ the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run” is consistent with this view.21 We can estimate a short -run, time -varying r* using a  standard reducedform IS (investment  and saving) equation that relates the unemployment gap to its own lagged value and the lagged real interest rate gap ."
 The rule used here is in terms of the unemployment gap instead of the output gap.
" The output gap is approximated using Okun’s law; specifically, Y t = 2.0(U* –  Ut), where U is the unemployment rate and U* is the nonaccelerating inflation rate of unemployment, or NAIRU."
" The revisions in the longer -run values and the short -run, time -varying  r* estimates provide a framework for understanding policymakers’ evolving views of the economy and of appropriate monetary policy."

" Indeed, our policy on the external communications of FOMC participants  states that “the Committee’s public accountability is strengthened by open discussion of Committee participants’ views about the economic outlook as well as their judgments about the appropriate course of monetary policy.”24  Central banking often comes across as obscure and complicated, and we try to help the public understand what we do."
