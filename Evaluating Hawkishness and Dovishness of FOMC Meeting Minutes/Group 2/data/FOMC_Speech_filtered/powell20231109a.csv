"Powell   Chair   Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at  “Monetary Policy Challenges in a Global Economy,” a  policy panel at  the 24th Jacques Polak Annual Research Conference, hosted by  the International Monetary Fund   Washington, D.C.        November 9, 2023    Thank you for the opportunity to participate in today’s panel discussion."
 My assigned topic is U.S. monetary policy in the current global inflation episode.
 U.S. inflation has come down over the past year  but remains well above our 2 percent target  (figure 1).1  My colleagues and I are gratified by this progress but expect that the process of getting inflation sustainably down to 2 percent has a long way to go.
" The labor market remains tight, although improvements in labor supply and a gradual easing in demand continue to move it into better balance.2  Gross domestic product  growth in the third quarter was quite strong, but, like most forecasters, we  expect growth to moderate in coming quarters."
" Of course, that remains to be seen, and we are attentive to the risk that  stronger growth could undermine further progress in restoring balance to the labor market and in bringing inflation down, which could warrant a response from monetary policy."
 The Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) is committed to achieving a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to 2 percent over time ; we are not confident that we have achieved such a stance.
" We know that ongoing progress toward our 2 percent goal is not assured:  Inflation has  1 Inflation under our preferred measure, the 12month change in the total personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, has declined from 6.6 percent in September 2022 to 3.4 percent in September 2023."
" The 12month change in the core PCE measure, which excludes the volatile food and energy prices and therefore may provide a better signal of where inflation is headed, has declined from 5.5 percent in September 2022 to 3.7 percent in September 2023."
" And while they remain above a level that would be consistent with 2 percent inflation in the longer run, broad indicators of 12month wage growth continue to trend lower."
" We are making decisions meeting by meeting, based on the totality of the incoming data  and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation, as well as the balance of risks , determining the extent of additional polic y firming that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time."
"  With that, I will turn to three questions that have arisen  from the receding but still elevated inflation w e are experiencing today."
" The first question is , with the benefit of 21/2 years to look back, what we can say about the initial causes and ongoing policy implications of the current inflation ."
"   After running below our 2 percent target over the first year of the pandemic, core PCE (personal consumption expenditures) inflation rose sharply in March 2021."
" Economic forecasters generally did not see this coming, as shown by the February 2021 Survey of Professional Forecasters, which showed core PCE inflation running at or below target over the subsequent three years.3  The real -time questions for policymakers were what caused the high inflation and how policy should react."
" At the outset, many forecasters and analysts, including FOMC participants , viewed the sudden upturn in inflation as mostly a function of pandemic -related shifts in the composition of demand, a disruption of supply chains, and a sharp decline in labor supply."
" The resulting supply and demand imbalances led to large increases  in the prices of a range of items most directly  3 The median projections of Q4 -toQ4 core PCE inflation from the February 2021 Survey of Professional Forecasters were 1.8 percent, 1.9 percent, and 2.0 percent for 2021, 2022, and 2023, respectively."
 Elevated demand for goods would shift back to services.
" Inflation would ease reasonably quickly without  the need for a significant policy response.4     Indeed, although monthly core PCE inflation spiked in March and April of 2021, beginning in May it declined for five consecutive  months, providing some support for  this view (figure 2)."
" That lack of progress, combined with very strong demand from households, contributed to a tight economy and a historically tight labor market, and more persistent high inflation."
" When we lifted off  in March , it was clear that bringing down inflation would depend both on the unwinding of the unprecedented pandemic -related demand and supply distortions and on our tightening of monetary policy, which would slow the growth of aggregate demand, allowing supply time to catch up."
" Today, t hese two processes are working together to bring inflation down."
 The FOMC has raised the federal funds rate target range  by 51/4 percentage  4 Both the June S ummary of E conomic Projections  and the August Survey of Professional Forecasters showed a near -uniform view that the incipient inflation would pass quickly and that inflation for 2022 would run near 2 percent.
 Neither the forecasters nor policymakers foresaw more than a modest tightening of monetary policy.
 Monetary policy is in restrictive territory and putting downward pressure on demand and inflation.
  The unwinding of pandemic -related supply and demand distortions is playing an important role in the decline of inflation.
" For example , wage growth has steadily fallen by most measures since mid -2022 (figure 3), despite continued robust job gains, reflecting a resurgence in labor supply thanks to higher labor force participation and a return of immigration to pre -pandemic levels."
" Going forward, it may be that a greater share of the progress in reducing inflation will have to come from tight monetary policy restraining the growth of aggregate demand.5  Turning to my second question, f or many  years, it has been generally thought  that monetary policy should limit its response to, or “look through,”  supply shocks to the extent that they are temporary  and idiosyncratic.6  Many argue  as well  that, in the future, supply disruptions are likely to be more frequent or more persistent than in the decades just before  the pandemic.7  A second question, then, is what we have learned about the standard “looking through” approach."
"  The idea that the response to the inflationary  effects of supply shocks should be attenuated arises, in part, from the tradeoff presented by those shocks."
" Supply shocks  5 See, for example, Ben Bernanke and Olivier Blanchard (2023), “ What Caused the U.S. PandemicEra Inflation?"
"” Hutchins Center Working Paper 86 (Washington:  Brookings Institution, Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy, June), https://www.brookings.edu/articles/whatcaused -theu-spandemic -erainflation ."
" 6 As I will return to later, this presumes that inflation expectations are well anchored."
"  - 5 - tend to move prices and employment in opposite directions, whereas monetary policy pushes each in the same direction."
" Therefore, the response of monetary policy to higher prices stemming from an adverse supply shock should be attenuated because it would otherwise amplify the unwanted decline in employment.8  In addition, supply shocks have most frequently come from the volatile food and energy categories and have pass ed quickly."
" To begin with, it can be challenging to disentangle supply shocks from demand shocks in real time, and also to determine how long either will persist, particularly in the extraordinary circumstances of the past three years."
 S upply shocks that have a persistent effect on potential output could call for restrictive policy to better align aggregate demand with the suppressed level of aggregate supply.
 Such a sequence calls on policymakers to use policy restraint to limit inflationary effects.
 Supply shocks that drive inflation high enough for long enough can affect the longer -term inflation expectations of households and businesses.

"  - 6 - any risks of a potential de -anchoring of inflation expectations , as well -anchored expectations help facilitate bringing inflation back to our target ."
 The sharp policy tightening during 2022 likely contributed to keeping inflation expectations well anchored.
      My t hird question is the level where interest rates will settle once the effects of the pandemic are truly behind us.
" By 2019, the general level of nominal interest rates had declined steadily over several decades  (figure 4)."
" As the pandemic arrived, many advanced economies had below -target inflation and low or mildly negative policy rates, raising difficult questions about the efficacy of interest rate policy when constrained by the effective lower bound (ELB)."
" Over two decades, an extensive literature had identified a number of possible changes to the widely used inflationtargeting regime, including negative policy rates , nominal income targeting , and various forms of makeup strategies under which persistent shortfalls in inflation would be followed by a period of inflation running moderately above 2 percent.9  Today, inflation and policy rates are elevated, and the ELB is not currently relevant for our policy decisions."
" But it is too soon  9 A number of these topics were discussed in the analytical work supporting the 2019 –20 framework review; see Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2020), “Review of Monetary Policy Strategy, Tools, and Communications,” webpage, https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/review -ofmonetary -policy -strategy -tools -andcommunications.htm ."
" For a discussion of the effect of the ELB on monetary policy strategy, see Fernando Duarte, Benjamin K."
  - 7 - to say whether the monetary policy challenges  of the ELB will ultimately turn out to be a thing of the past .
The prolonged proximity of interest  rates to the ELB  was at the heart of the monetary policy review and the changes we made to our framework in 2020.
 Among the questions we will consider is the degree to which the structural features of the economy that led to low interest rates in the pre -pandemic era will persist.
" With time, we will continue to learn from  the experience of the past few years, and what implications it may hold for monetary policy."
