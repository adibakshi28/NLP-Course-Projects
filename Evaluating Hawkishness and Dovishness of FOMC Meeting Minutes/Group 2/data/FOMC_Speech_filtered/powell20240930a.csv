"Powell   Chair   Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at the  National Association for Business Economics Annual Meeting   Nashville, Tennessee         September 30, 202 4   I have some brief comments on the economy and monetary policy and look forward to our discussion."
   Our economy is strong overall and has made significant progress over the past two years toward achieving our dual -mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices.
" Inflation has eased , and my Federal Open Market Committee colleagues and I  have greater confidence that it is on a sustainable path to 2 percent."
"  That decision reflects our growing confidence that, with an appropriate recalibration of our policy stance, strength in the labor market can be maintained in a n environment  of moderate economic growth and inflation moving sustainably down to our objective ."
" To mention just a few, the unemployment rate is well within the range of estimates of its natural rate."
" Real wages are increasing at a solid pace, broadly in line with gains in productivity."
"  The moderation in job growth and t he increase in labor supply have led the unemployment rate  to increase to  4.2 percent , still low by historical standards ."
 We do not believe that we need to see further cooling in labor market conditions to achieve 2  percent  inflation.
" Inflation  Over the most recent 12 months, headline and core inflation were 2.2 percent and 2.7 percent , respectively ."
" Disinflation has been broad  based , and recent data indicate  further progress toward a sustained return to 2 percent."
" Outside of housing, core services inflation is also close to its pre -pandemic pace."
" Housing services inflation continues to decline, but sluggishly."
  The growth rate in rents charged to new tenants remains low.
" As long as that remains the case, housing services inflation will continue to decline ."
Broader economic conditions  also set the table for further disinflation.
 Longer -run inflation expectations remain well anchored.
"   Monetary Policy    Over the past year, we have continued to see solid growth and healthy  gains in the labor force and productivity."
 Our goal all along  has been to restore price stability without the kind of painful rise in unemployment that has frequently accompanied efforts to bring down high inflation .
" For much of the past three years, inflation ran well above our goal, and the labor market was extremely tight."
" Appropriately, our focus was on bringing down inflation."
" By keeping monetary policy restrictive, we helped restore the balance between overall supply and demand in the economy."
 That patient approach has paid dividends:  Inflation  is now much closer to our 2  percent  objective .
" Today, w e see the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals as roughly in balance."
" At the time of that meeting, core inflation was above 4 percent, well above our target, and unemployment was 3.5 percent, near a 50year low."
" In the 14 months since, inflation has moved down, and unemployment has moved up, in both cases significantly."
"    As I mentioned, our decision to reduce our policy rate by 50 basis points reflects our growing confidence that, with an appropriate recalibration of our policy stance, strength in the labor market can be maintained in a context of moderate economic growth and inflation moving sustainably down to 2 percent."
   We remain resolute in our commitment to our maximum -employment and price -stability mandates.
