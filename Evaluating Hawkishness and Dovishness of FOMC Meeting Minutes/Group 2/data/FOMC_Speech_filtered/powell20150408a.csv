"For release on delivery  8:00 a.m. EDT  April 8 , 2015         Remarks on Monetary Policy     Remarks by   Jerome H."
" In these brief remarks, I will discuss the progress of the economy and the path forward for monetary policy.1  The current expansion is almost six years old and is now one of the longest since World War II."
 Assessing the scope for further improvement will be important in judging the appropriate path for monetary policy.
" After its most recent meeting in March, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) modified its forward guidance to say that an increase in the target range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate when the Committee has seen further improvement in the labor market and is reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term."
 The timing of liftoff and the pace of subsequent rate increases will depend on incoming data and on realized and expected progress toward our congressionally  mandated goals of stable prices a nd maximum employment.
" Monetary policy works  with long and variable lags, so rate increases need to begin well before we reach those goals."
" The unemployment rate has declined from 10 percent in October 2009 to 5.5 percent in March 2015, a level that is not far above 1 The views I express here today are mine alone and not necessarily those of any other member of the Federal Open Market Committee."
 But the unemployment rate probably understates the amount of slack still remaining in the labor market.
  The Committee said that it will want to be reasonably confident that inflation will move back to 2 percent over the medium term.
" On a 12month basis, headline inflation in February, as measured by the personal consumption expenditures price index, stood at 0.3 percent; meanwhile, core inflation, which excludes volatile energy and food components, was 1.4 percent."
" Before those shocks, both headline inflation and core inflation were running at about 1.5 percent."
" When the effects of these shocks pass, I expect that inflation will return roughly to those earlier levels and then rise gradually to our 2 percent objective over the medium term as labor and product markets tighten further."
" Despite the current low inflation readings, survey -based measures of inflation expectations in the United States have been stable."
" However, market -based readings on inflation compensation have declined significantly since mid -2014."
" I view this decline as more likely reflecting movements in risk premiums and other transitory factors, rather than shifts in longer -term inflation expect ations."
" Still, it will be important to keep an eye on the performance of  inflation  breakevens."
" Of course, if the economy improves faster or inflation increases more than expected, it will be appropriate to raise rates faster."
" There are several reasons why it may be appropriate to raise rates somewhat gradually, including the proximity of the zero lower bound for inter est rates and continuing economic headwinds in the wake of the crisis .2  I would like to explore a rationale that has received somewhat less attention, which is the unusually high level of uncertainty today about capacity measures such as the natural rate of unemployment.3  Uncertainty about the precise level of these indicators becomes more important for policy as the expansion continues and the economy approaches its potential, defined as the level of output that is consistent with stable prices."

3 The natural rate of unemployment can be thought of as the unemployment rate at which the labor market is at its long -run equilibrium and inflation  is stable.

"                                                      - 4 - All else  equal, a decision to return interest rates to more -normal levels implies that the economy is nearing its capacity."
" It seems plausible that at least part of this supply -side damage could be reversed if the economy enjoys a period of sust ained growth.4  To encourage that outcome, as monetary policymakers consider removing accommodation, we should look for a little more proof than usual that labor markets  are tightening or other supply -side constraints are binding."
" Of course, if the effect s of the crisis prove difficult to reverse and, as a result , inflation pressures do emerge, the Federal Reserve will use its tools to contain them."

" Economists and policymakers have tended at first to view a decline in output as a cyclical shock to demand and to realize only gradually over time that a crisis has done substantial and lasting  damage to the productive capacity of the economy.6  As a result, estimates of the gap between actual and potential output often narrow over time , partly through higher actual output but also through lower  estimates of potential."
"  For example, f igure 2 shows that the Congressional Budget Office has made a series of downward revisions to its estimates of potential output in recent years.7 This supply -side damage has typically appeared both in the labor market and in the capital stock.8  Long spells of une mployment cause skills to atrophy and make it more difficult for workers to find new jobs, raising the natural rate of unemployment for those who do remain in the labor force and causing others to throw in the towel and drop out."
" Extended periods of weak demand appear to cause companies to invest less in plant and technology, which slows the growth of the productivity of the workforce."
" The number of new business formations declines sharply, perhaps because of  reduced credit availability, which may depress  hiring, productivity, business innovation, and hence trend output.9  6 For example, Martin, Munyan, and Wilson show that estimates of potential output generated by common filtering techniques  tend to revise down following recessions as actual output grows slower than its pre -recession trend; see Martin, Munyan, and Wilson, “Potential Output and Recessions,” in note 5 ."

" But the productivity slowdown suggests that monetary policy cannot, by itself, avert all of the damage."

"12 There is considerable debate about how much of the decline in the employment -topopulation ratio and labor force participation has been due to the recession, how much of that decline is reversible, and, relatedly, how much of the decline would have occurred regardless in the absence of a recession."
" For th e argument that much of the decrease in labor force participation would likely have occurred even in the absence of the recession, see Stephanie Aaronson , Tomaz Cajner, Bruce Fallick, Felix Galbis -Reig, Christopher Smith, and William Wascher  (2014 ), “Labor  Force Participation:  Recent Developments and Future Prospects,” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity , Fall, pp."

" As business confidence improves, employers may be more willing to take a chance on someone with an extended spell of unemployment."
" A stronger job market and rising wages may encourage more pot ential workers to join the labor force.14  Over a longer period, stronger demand can produce higher capital investment, driving higher productivity."
 A long expansion could also produce higher productivity as companies strive to get more out of every dollar  of capital and hour of work and as the strong economy encourages entrepreneurship and innovation.
"  To give us the best chance to recover lost ground, we need policies that support labor force participation, business and household confidence, hiring and i nvestment, and productivity growth-- policies, I hasten to add, that are , for the most part , outside the remit of the Federal Reserve."
 Monetary policy also has a role to play by continuing to support the expansion as long as inflation expectations remain s table and realized inflation stay s close to our 2 percent  objective.
" Indeed, in the current circumstances, accommodative policy may not only help restore some of our economy’s potential , but should also help return inflation to our 2 percent  objective mor e expeditiously."
  There is no riskfree path for monetary policy.
 Overly accommodat ive monetary policy also poses risks.
" First, the economy could overheat , and rising inflation could require the Committee to raise rates faster, which --if overdone --could produce a damaging recession."
" While I do not see a troubling buildup of these risks today, tighter monetary policy might eventually be necessary if such ri sks do appear."
" As the FOMC moves to return monetary policy to a more normal footing, it makes sense to me to move fairly gradually as long as the incoming data evolve about as expected."
