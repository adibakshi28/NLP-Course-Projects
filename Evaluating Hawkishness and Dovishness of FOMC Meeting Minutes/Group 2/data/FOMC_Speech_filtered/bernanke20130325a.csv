" - 2 - Because I have developed these themes in some detail elsewhere, I thought today I would tackle a different and more recent i ssue that has arisen in the aftermath of the crisis --the issue of whether , in the widespread easing of monetary policies, we are seeing a competitive depreciation of exchange rates .2  Like other aspects of the crisis, the notion of competitive depreciation  has strong classical antecedents , particularly in relation to  the global Great Depression of the 1930s."
" For one, the exchange rates implied by the gold val uations that countries chose for their currencies following World War I were in some cases far from the levels consistent with balanced flows in trade and payments."
" - 3 - Kingdom in the late  1920s.3  One of Mervyn King’s predecessors as governor of the Bank of England, Montagu Norman, who presided over both Britain’s return to the gold standard and its subsequent exit, said of the ill -fated choice of parity for the pound:  “Only God could tell whether it [the value in gold chosen for the pound sterli ng] was or was not the correct figure”; another  commentator added, “But of course the Deity may not be an Economist.”4  Another problem, which became clear as the global economy weakened and financial conditions deteriorated, was that fixed exchange rates under the gold standard were vulnerable to speculative runs."
" According to this a nalysis, as put forth by important contemporary economists like Joan Robinson, exchange rate depreciations helped the economy whose currency had weakened by making the country more competitive internationally.5  Indeed, the decline in the value of the pound after 1931 was                                                  3 See John Maynard Keynes  (1925),  The Economic Consequences of Mr. Churchill  (London:  Hogarth Press)."

" By 1935 or 1936, when essentially all ma jor countries had left the gold standard and exchange rates were market -determined, the net trade effects of the changes in currency values were certainly small."
" The reason was  that, in shedding the strait jacket of the gold standard, each country became free to use monetary policy in a way that was more commensurate with achieving full                                                  6 See Barry Eichengreen  and Jeffrey Sachs (1985),  “Exchange Rates and Economic Recovery in the 1930s, ” Journal of Economic History , vol."
 - 5 - employment at home.
" Moreover, and critically, countries also benefited from stronger growth in trading partners that purchased their exports."
" In sharp contrast to the tariff wars, monetary reflation in the 1930s was a positive -sum exercise, whose benefits came mainly from higher domestic demand in all countries , not from  trade diversion arising from  changes  in exchange rates."
" W ith inflation generally contained, central banks in thes e countries are providing accommodative monetary policies to support growth."
" To the contrary, because mone tary policy is accommodative in the great majority of advanced industrial economies, one woul d not expect large and persistent changes in the configuration of exchange rates among these countries."
 The benefits of monetary accommodation in the advanced economies are not created in any significant way by changes in exchange rates; they  come instead  from the support for domestic aggregate demand in each country or region.
" Moreover, because stronger growth in each economy confers beneficial spillovers to trading partners, these policies are not “beggar -thyneighbor” but rather are positive -sum, “enri chthy-neighbor” actions."
" To a first approximation, industrial countries are most concerned that domestic aggregate demand be set at the level that best fosters price stability and a return to full employment at home ."
" In contrast, many emerging market economies may be concerned  not only with the level of domestic demand (as needed to achieve objectives for employment and inflation) but with other considerations as well."
" Second, because many emerging market economies have  financial sectors that are small  or less developed by global standards but open to foreign investors, they may perceive themselves to be vulnerable to asset bubbles and financial imbalances caused by heavy and volatile capital inflows, including those ari sing from low interest rates in the advanced economies."
" Regarding the effects of monetary  easing on exchange rates and exports,  I would note that trade -weighted real exchange rates of emerging market economies, with some exceptions, have not changed much from their values shortly before the intensification of the financial crisis in late 2008."
"  - 7 - advanced economies were to lead to significant currency appreciation in emerging markets, the resulting drag on their competitiveness would have to be balanced against the positive effects of stronger advanced -economy demand."
" Simulations of the Federal Reserve Board’s econometric models of the global economy suggest that the effects are roughly offsetting, so that accommodative monetary policies in the advanced economies do not appear, on net, to have adverse consequences for output and exports in the emerging market economies.8  A return to solid growth among the advanced economies is ultimately in the interest of advanced and emerging market economies alike."
 Regarding capit al flows:  It is true that interest rate differentials associated with differences in national monetary policies can promote cross -border capital flows  as investors seek higher returns .
" But my reading of recent research makes me skeptical that these polic y differences are the dominant force behind capital flows to emerging market economies; differences in growth prospects  across countries  and swings in investor risk sentiment seem to have played a larger role.9  Moreover, the fact that some emerging market  economies have policies that depress the values of their currencies may create an expectation of future appreciation that in and of itself induces speculative inflows."

"  9 For example, Fratzscher , Lo Duca, and Straub find that factors other than U.S. monetary policy have been substantially more important as drivers of capital flows to emerging market economies ; see Marcel Fratzscher, Marco Lo Duca, and Roland Straub  (2012 ), “A Global Monetary Tsun ami?"
"                                                  10 Importantly, such circumstances exclude the use of capital controls to avoid other necessary macroeconomic policy adjustments, such as greater exchange rate flexibility."
