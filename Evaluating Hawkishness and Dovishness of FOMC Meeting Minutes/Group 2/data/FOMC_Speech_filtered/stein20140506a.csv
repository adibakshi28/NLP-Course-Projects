"  For release on delivery  7:00 p.m. EDT   May 6 , 2014          Challenges for Monetary Policy Communication     Remarks by   Jeremy C."
  One of the many aspects of the job that I had not fully appreciated before joining the Board is how challenging the whole process of communicating about monetary policy can be.
" In this spirit, I would like to spend the rest of my time discussing a few of the things that make life interesting for thos e trying to communicate clearly and effectively about monetary policy."
"Hall, ‘The Routes into and out of the Zero Lower Bound, ’” speech delivered at “Global Dimensions of Unconventional Monetary Policy,” a symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, held in Jackson Hole, Wyo., August 2224, available at www.kc.frb.org/publications/research/escp/escp -2013.cfm , pp."
" Moreover, this same optimism can motivate them to leverage their positions aggressively.6 In this setting, a piece of monetary policy commun ication that merely “clarifies” things --that is , one that delivers the median market expectation but truncates some of the more extreme possibilities --can have powerful effects."
" To be clear, I am not saying that monetary policy communications should have been different during this period ."
" The 6.5 percent unemployment threshold that we had until recently was not only quantitative in nature, but it also represented a relatively firm commitment on the part of the Committee."
" Monetary policy will be geared to evolving conditions in the economy, and the public does need to understand that as those views evolve, the Committee’s views on policy will likely evolve with them."
" That is, QE3 has, in my view, mattered not just because of the direct downward pressure on longer -term interest rates associated with removing a given quantity of duration from the private market, but also because it has buttressed our forward guidance by serving as a credible signal of the Committee’s intentions with respect to the future path of the federal funds rate."
" For example, if it is early 2013 and the market has somehow arrived at the belief that the Committee will continue buying assets at an $85 billion per month clip so long as monthly payroll growth does not exceed 200,000 jobs per month for three months in a  row, then even a small cut down to $80 billion per month is likely to elicit a powerful market reaction --not because the $5 billion cut is consequential in and of itself, but because of the message it sends about the Committee’s policy leanings more gener ally."
" Consider the well -known phenomenon of “gradualism” in monetary policy, whereby changes to the policy rate during an easing or tightening cycle tend to come in a series of small and relatively predictable steps."
" This phenomenon is reflected in the fact that the Committee’s behavior in normal times can be approximately described by an “inertial” version of a Taylor rule --one in which , in addition to putting weight on infl ation and unemployment, the Committee also behaves as if it has an aversion to making sudden large changes in the federal funds rate."
" For if we were to make an unexpectedly  abrupt adjustment at any time, it would likely have a large effect on long -term rates and credit conditions more generally, which in turn might compromise our ability to reach our goals for employment and inflation --for example, a large bond -market move o f this sort might nip a nascent recovery in the bud, which is why it is to be avoided."
"  On the one hand, as I have emphasized, a gradualist approach to monetary policy is likely to be the best way for us to deliver on our mandate at any point in time,    - 11 - taking as given the market’s expectations for Fed behavior."
" There is always a temptation for the central bank to speak in a whisper,                                                  10 There is a close connection between this timeconsistency problem  and the well -known one  that central banks face in trading off inflation and  unemployment ."
" With respect to the latter, Kenneth Rogoff  has argued that one can achieve a better outcome with a “conservative” central banker who places a higher weight on controlling inflation than does society as a whole."
