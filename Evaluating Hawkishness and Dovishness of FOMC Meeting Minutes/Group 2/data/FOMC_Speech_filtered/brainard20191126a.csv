"For release on delivery  1:00 p.m.  EST November 26, 2019         Federal Reserve Review  of  Monetary Policy Strategy, Tools, and Communications :   Some Preliminary Views     Remarks by  Lael Brainard   Member   Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at the  Presentation of the 2019 William F."
"  I will offer my preliminary views on  the Federal Reserve’s review of its monetary policy strategy, tools, and communications  after first touching briefly on the economic outlook."
" Th e framework review is ongoing and will extend into 2020, and no conclusions have been reached at this time .1   Outlook and Policy  There are good reasons to expect the economy to grow at a pace modestly above potential over the next year or so, supported by s trong consumers and a healthy job market , despite  persistent  uncertainty about trade conflict and disappointing foreign growth."
" Consumer sentiment remains solid , and the employment picture  is positive ."
 Housing seem s to have turned a corner and is poised for growth following  several weak quarters .
"  Business investment remains downbeat , restrained by weak growth abroad and trade  conflict."
  - 2 - Employment  remain s strong.
" T he employment -topopulation rat io for prime -age adults  has moved up to its pre -recession peak , and the  three -month moving average of the  unemployment rate is near a 50 -year low .2  Monthly job gains remain above the pace needed to absorb new entrants into the labor force  despite some slowing since last year ."
"Data on inflation have come in about as I expected, on balance , in recent months ."
" Inflation remains below the Federal Reserve’ s 2 percent  symmetric  objective, which  has been true  for most of  the past seven years."
" The price index for  core  personal  consumption expenditures (PCE) , which excludes food and energy prices  and is a better indicator of f uture inflation than overall PCE  prices , increased  1.7 percent over the 12 months through September ."
Foreign growth remains s ubdued.
" While there are signs that the decline in euro -area manufacturing is stabilizing, the latest indicators on economic activity in China remain sluggish, and the news in Japan and in many emerging markets  has been disappointing."
" T he risk of a disorderly Brexit in the near future has declined significantly , and there is some  hope  that a  U.S. –                                                 2 Claudia Sahm shows that a 1/2 percentage point increase in the three -month moving average of the unemployment rate relative to the previous year’s low is a goo d real -time recession indicator."
" The baseline is  for continued moderate ex pansion, a strong labor market, and inflation moving gradually to  our symme tric 2 percent objective ."
 The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has taken significant action to provide insurance against the risks associated with trade conflict and weak foreign growth against a backdrop of muted inflation.
" It will take some time for  the full effect of  this accommodation to work its  way through economic activity, the labor market, and inflation."
" Review  The Federal Reserve is  conducting a review of our monetary policy strategy, tools, and communications  to make sure we are well positioned  to advance our statutory goals  of maximum employment and price stability.3  Three key features of toda y’s new normal call for a  reassessment  of our monetary policy strategy :  the neutral rate is very                                                  3 Information about the r eview of monetary policy strategy, tools, and communications is available on the Board’ s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/review -ofmonetary -policy -strategy -tools -andcommunications.htm ."

"  - 4 - low here and abroad, trend inflation is running below target, and the sensitivity of price inflation to resource utilization is very low.4   First, trend inflation is be low target .5  Underlying trend inflation appears to be running a few tenths below the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective, according to various statistical filters."
 This raises the risk that households  and businesses could come to expect inflation to run persist ently below our  target and change their behavior in a way that reinforces that expectation.
" Indeed, w ith inflation having fallen short of 2 percent  for most of the  past seven  years, inflation ex pectations may  have declined , as suggested by some survey -based  measures of longrun inflation expectations  and by market -based  measures of inflation compensation."
" Second, the sensitivity of price inflation to resource utilization is very low ."
" A flat Phillips curve has the important advantage of allow ing employment  to continue expanding for  longer  without generating inflationary pressures , thereby providing greater opportunities to more people ."
 But it also makes it harder to achieve our 2 percent inflation objective on a sustained basis when inflation expectations have drifted below 2 percent .
"Third , the longrun neutral rate  of interest  is very lo w, which means that we are likely to see more frequent and prolonged episodes when the federal funds rate is stuck at                                                  4 See Lael Brainard ( 2016) , “The ‘New Normal’ and What It Means  for Monetary Policy, ” speech delivered at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, Chicago, September 12, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/brainard20160912a.htm ."

 - 5 - its effective lower bound  (ELB) .6  The neutral rate  is the level of the federal funds rate that would keep  the economy at full employment and 2 percent inflation if no ta ilwinds or headwinds were buffeting the economy.
" A  variety of forces have  likely contributed to a decline in the neutral rate, including demographic trends  in many large economies, some slowing in the rate of productivity growth, and increases in the dem and for safe assets."
" This large loss of policy space will tend to increase the frequency or length of periods when the policy rate is pinned at the ELB , unemployment is elevated, and inflation is below targe t.9  In turn, the experience of frequent or extended periods of low                                                  6 See Lael Brainard ( 2015) , “Normalizing Monetary Policy When the Neutral Interest Rate Is Low ,” speech delivered at the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research, Stanford, Calif.,  December 1, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/brainard20151201a.htm ."

" The risk is a downward spiral where  conventional policy space gets compressed even further, the ELB binds even more frequently, and it becomes increasingly difficult to move inflation expectations and inflation back up to target."
"  While consumers and businesses might see very l ow inflation  as having benefits at the individual  level, at the aggregate level,  inflation that is too low can make it very challenging for monetary policy to cut the short -term nominal interest rate sufficiently to cushion the economy effectively.10  The experience of Japan  and of the euro area more recent ly suggest s that th is risk is real."
" Indeed, the fact that Japan and the euro area are struggling with this  challenging triad further complicates our task, because  there are important potential spillove rs from monetary policy in other  major economies  to our own economy through exchange rate and yield curve channels .11 In light of the likelihood of more frequent episodes at the ELB , our monetary policy review  should advance  two goals."
" First , monetary policy should achieve average inflation  outcomes  of 2 percent over time  to re -anchor  inflation expectations at our target."
"10 The important observation that some consumers and businesses see low inflation as having benefits  emerged from listening to a diverse range of perspectives , includi ng representatives of consumer, labor, business, community, and other g roups during the Fed Listens  events; for details, see https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/review -ofmonetary -policy -strategy -tools -andcommunications -fedlistens -events.htm ."
 - 7 - Achieving the Inflation Target  The apparent slippage in t rend inflati on below  our target call s for some adjustments  to our monetary policy strategy and communications .
" In this context  and as part of our r eview , my colleagues and I  have been discussing  how to better anchor inflation expectations firmly at our objec tive."
" In particular, it may be helpful  to specify  that policy aims to achieve inflation outcomes that average  2 percent over time or over the cycle."
" G iven the persistent  shortfall of inflation  from its target over recent years, this would imply  supporting inflation a bit  above 2 percent  for some time to compensate for the period of underperformance ."
One class of  strategies that has been proposed to address this issue are formal “makeup” r ules that seek to compensate for  past inflation deviations from target.
" For instance, u nder price -level targeting, policy seeks to stabilize the price level around a constant growth path that is consistent with the inflation objective .12  Under average inflation targeting , policy seeks t o return the average of inflation to the target over some specified peri od.13 To be successful, formal makeup strategies require that financial market participants, households , and businesses understand in advance an d believe, to some degree, that policy will compensate for past misses."
"13 See, for exam ple, Lars Svensson (2019), “Monetary Policy Strategies for the Federal Reserve,” presented at “Conference on Monetary Policy Strategy, Tools and Communication Practices,” sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, Chicago, June 5 , https://www.chicagofed.org/~/media/others/events/2019/monetary -policy -conference/monetary -policy -strategies -svensson -pdf.pdf?la =en."
" For example, if inflation has been running well below —or above —target for a sustain ed period, when the time arrives to maintain inflation commensurately above —or below —2 percent for the same amount of time, economic  conditions will typically be inconsistent with implementing the promised  action."
" A nalysis  also suggest s it could take many years with a formal average inflation targeting framework to return  inflation to target following an ELB episode , although this depends on difficult -toassess modeling assumptions and the  particulars of the strategy .14   Thus, while  formal  average inflation targeting rules have some attractive properties in theory, they could be challenging to implement in  practice."
 I prefer  a more flexible approach  that would anchor inflation expectations at 2 percent by achieving inflation outcomes that average 2 percent over time  or over the cycle.
" F or instance, following five  years when the public has observed inflation outcomes  in the range of 11/2 to 2 percent, to avoid a decline in expectations , the Committee w ould target  inflation  outcomes  in a range of, say, 2 to 21/2 percent for  the subseque nt five  years to achieve inflation  outcomes of 2 percent  on average overall ."
" Flexible  inflation averaging  could bring some  of the benefits of a formal average inflation targeting rule , but it would be simpler to communicate."
"  By committing to achieve inflation outcomes that average 2 percent over time, the Committee would make  clear in advance that it would                                                  14 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2019), “Minutes of the Federal Open Market Comm ittee, September 17 –18, 2019,” press release, October 9, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20191009a.htm ; and David Reifschneider an d David Wilcox (2019), “Average Inflation Targeting Would Be a Weak Tool for the Fed to Deal with Recession and Chronic Low Inflation,” Policy Brief PB19 -16 (Washington:  Peterson Institute for International Economics, November), https://www.piie.com/sites/default/files/documents/pb19 -16.pdf ."
"  - 9 - accommodate rather than offset modest upward pressures to inflation in what could be described as  a process of opportunistic reflation.15 Policy at the ELB  Second, the Committee is  examining what monetary policy tools are likely to be effective in providing accommodation when the federal funds rate is at the ELB.16  In my view, the review should make cl ear that  the Committee will actively employ  its full toolkit so that the ELB is not an impediment to  providing accommodation in the face of significant economic disruptions ."

"For t hese reasons,  I have been  interested in exploring approaches that expand the space for  targeting interest rates  in a more continuous fashion as an extension of our conventional policy spac e and in a way that reinforces forward guidance  on the policy rate.18  In particular, there may be advantages to an approach that caps interest rates on                                                  17 For details on purchase s of securities by the Federal Reserve, see https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/timeline -balancesheet -policies.htm ."

"To be specific, once the policy rate declines to  the ELB, this approach would smoothly move to cap ping interest rates on the short -tomedium segment  of the yield curve ."
" Moreover , if the  horizon on the interest rate  caps is  set so as to reinforce forward guida nce on the policy rate , doing so would augment the credibility of th e yield curve caps and thereby diminish concerns about an openended balance sheet commitment ."
" As we saw in the United States at the end of 2015 and agai n toward the second half of 2016, there tends to be strong pressure to “normalize” or lift off from the ELB pre emptively based on historical relationships between inflation and employment."

" - 12 - the liftoff from the ELB until  full employment and 2 percent inflation ha ve been achieved on a sustained basis—say over the course of a year —could improve performance on our dualmandate goals .19 To reinforce this commitment, the forward guidance on the policy rate could be implemented in tandem with yield curve caps ."
" For example , as the federal funds rate approaches the ELB, the Committee could commit to refrain from lifting off the ELB until full employment and 2 percent inflation a re sustained for a year."
" If the outlook shifts materially , the Committee could re assess how long it will take to get inflation back to 2 percent and adjust policy accordingly."
  The combination of a commitment to condition liftoff on the sustained achievement of our employment and inflation objectives with yield curve caps  targeted at the same horizon  has the potential  to work well in many circumstances.
" Presumably , the re quisite scale of such purchases —when combined with mediumterm yield curve ceilings  and forward guidance  on the policy                                                  19 See Ben Bernanke, Michael Kiley, and John Roberts (2019), “Monetary Policy Strategies for a Low -Rate Environment,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2019 -009 (Washington:  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System ), https://doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2019.009 ; and  Chung and others, “ Monetary Policy Options at the Effective Lower Bound,” in note 9."
" Monetary Policy and Financial Stability  Before closing, it is important to recall another important lesson of the financial crisis :  The stability  of the financial system is important to the achievement of the statutory goals of full employment and 2 percent inflation."
" In th at regard , the changes in the macroeconomic environment that underlie our monetary policy review  may have  some  impl ications for financial stability ."
" Historically, when the Phillips curve was steeper, inflation tended to rise as the economy heated up, whic h prompted the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates."
" In turn, the interest rate increases would have the effect of tightening financial conditions more broadly."
" With a flat Phillips curve, inflation does not rise as much as resource utilization tightens, and interest rates are less likely to rise to restrictive levels ."
" The resulting lowerfor-longer  interest rates , along with sustained high rates of resource utilization , are conducive to increasing risk appetite , which could prompt reachfor-yield behavior and incentives to take on additional debt, leading to financial imbalanc es as an expansion extends ."
"   To the extent that the combination of a low neutral rate, a flat Phillips curve, and low underlying inflation may lead  financ ial stability risks to become  more tightly linked to the business cycle, it would be prefe rable  to use tools  other than tightening monetary policy to temper the financial cycle."
" In particular, a ctive use of macroprudential  tools such as the countercy clical  buffer i s vital to enable monetary policy to stay focused on achieving maximum employment and average inflation of 2 percent  on a sustained basis."
"    - 14 - Conclu sion  The Federal Reserve’s commitment to adapt our monetary policy strategy  to changing circumstances has enabled us to  support the U.S. economy throughout the expansion, which is now in its 11 th year ."
" In light of the decline in the neutral rate, low trend inflation, and low sensitivity of inflation to slack as well as the consequent greater  frequency of the policy rate being at the effective lower bound, t his is an important  time to review  our monetary policy strategy, tools, and communications  in order  to improve the achievement of our statutory goals ."
" I have offered some preliminary thoughts on how we could bolster inflation expectations by achieving inflation outcomes of 2 percent on average over time and, when policy is constrained by the ELB, how we could combine forward guidance  on the policy rate  with caps on the short -tomedium segme nt of the yield curve to buffer the economy against adverse developments ."
