"E ST January 17, 2017         Monetary Policy in a Time of  Uncertainty     Remarks by   Lael Brainard   Member   Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve  System   at  The Brookings Institution  Washington, D.C.        January 17, 2017    There are many sources of  uncertainty affecting the trajectory of the U.S. economy and, by extension, the appropriate path of monetary policy."
" It thus seems possible  that monetary policy could be affected for some time  by uncertain ty surrounding  fiscal policy and its effec ts on the economy.1  Macroeconomic O utcomes A re Difficult to P redict  Before I turn  to the  possible  effects of fiscal policy, it is helpful to remind ourselves of the immense uncertainty that accompanies any attempt to forecast future economic developments ."
" Many possible surpris es could materially  affect the future path of the U.S.  economy , such as  shocks to the price of oil,  the foreign economic  outlook, the rate of productivity growth, the sentiment of households and business es, financial stability, and fiscal policy , to name a few ."
" The resulting uncertainty makes it difficult to predict  the future path of activity,  unemployment, and inflation."
"  By statute, the Federal Reserve i s mandated to conduct m onetary policy  to promote the long  run goals of maximum employment and stable prices."
" In today’s framework, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has defined stable prices to mean 2 percent inflation ."
 U ncertainty about  future employment and inflation naturally translates into uncertainty about the path of future monetary policy.
"  One useful measure of uncertainty is the magnitude of forecast errors , or the extent to which macr oeconomic outcomes  have differed  from professional economic forecasters ’ expect ations.2  Over the past 30 years , outside forecasts of the unemployment rate four quarters  ahead  have miss ed the actual unemployment rate by more th an 3/4 percentage point in either direction  onethird of the time."
" Since notable departures from forecast  values  of unemployment and inflation occur with some frequency , it should not  be surprising that  the associated forecasts of interest rates have a si milar track record."
"Onethird of the time o ver the  past 30 years , outside forecasts of the level of short -term interest rates  four quarters ahead  have been above or below the actual level by more than  11/4 percentage points.3  Thus, it is important to keep in mind t hat all macro forecasts and projections of monetary policy  are subject to considerable uncertainty,  as they are based on information at a point in time , and actual developments could well evolve much different ly."
" Fiscal Policy  Considerations  Among the many factors that can affect  the aggregate economy and, by extension, monetary policy, a possible shift in fiscal policy has a ttracted the attention of both economic forecasters and financial markets  of late."
 3 The short -term interest rate used in this analysis is the three -month Treasury bill rate.
"  - 3 - forecast of inflation and 47 percent had raised their forecast of gross domestic product (GDP ) growth  because of  the recent U.S. election results , although on average forecast changes were modest."
" Federal fiscal deficits, adjusted for the cyclical state of the economy, increased by roughl y 21/2 percentage points of GDP from the period before the elections to six  years following the election s, federal debt held by the public increased from about 25 percent of GDP to nearly 40 percent , and the current account de ficit widen ed.4  Following th e 2000 elections , similar fiscal changes  resulted in an increase in  the fiscal deficit of close to 3 percentage points of GDP  over the first six years of the new Administration on a cyclically adjusted basis ."
" Of course, there are important differences in today’s conditions  relative to these historical settings , including  the economy’s cyclical position, current and projected levels of indebtedness, the relative position of the global economy, and monetary policy settings ."
" It is instructive to contemplate the important dimensions along which fiscal policy and its effe cts might                                                  4 Annual d ata on cyclically adjusted federal deficits can be found in table C -2 of the Congressional Budget Office (2016, p."
"  The analysis  takes a threeyear centered moving average of the CBO ’s estimates of the cyclically  adjusted federal deficit, which can be quite volatile from year to year, and compares  this average for the year prior to the new A dministration to the  average in the sixth year of the new A dministration."
   - 4 - vary as well as  their  implications for monetary policy.
" In addition to the critical size and timing issues, there are four key dimensions:  (1) the composition of policy changes  and their relative  effect s on aggregate demand and aggregate supply, (2) the distance of the  econ omy from full employment and 2 percent inflation, (3) the divergence in the cyclical position of the U .S."
Different types of policies can generate very different economi c responses  and have  implications regarding  both the amount of  aggregate  economic stimulus per fiscal dollar  and also whether the effect is predominantly to raise aggregate demand  or also to expand the supply potential of the economy .
" Generally, fiscal st imulus that expands spending and investment  directly or is targeted to households and businesses  that have the greatest propensity to spend rather than save can be expected to  generate the largest response  in aggregate demand .5     Focusing first on policies that affect only aggregate demand , temporary demandbased fiscal expansions can speed recovery when the economy is some distance from full employment and target inflation, particularly if conventional monetary policy is constrained by the effecti ve lower bound."
" But when the economy is either close to or at full employment and inflation is c onverging  to or at  its target, additional fiscal demand will more likely result in inflationary pressures."
" T hus, fiscal expansions that  affect only aggrega te demand and are enacted when the economy is near full emp loyment and 2 percent inflation  are relatively less likely to sustainably boost economic activity and relatively more likely to be accompanied by increases  in interest rates ."

"  - 5 - The current nominal  neutral interest rate--or the level of the federal funds rate  that is consistent with output growing close to its potential rate with full employment and stable inflation --is quite low  at present .6  Adjusting for inflation, most  estimates of the  neutral rate are currently close to zero, compared with about  2 percent for the quarter -century prior to the financial crisis.7  A low neutral rate implies that conventional monetary policy  has less room to respond when the economy is hit by adverse shocks ."
" With conventional  monetary policy constrained  in the vicinity of the lower bound, it is more difficult for the economy to recover and for inflation to move back to target.8 Policies that persistently raise aggregate demand alone can lift the neutral rat e, but that may come  at substantial cost."
" Because these policies do not affect the econo my’s longterm growth potential but  do result in persistent fiscal deficits, they can lead to substantial increases in the debt -toGDP ra tio."
" In this regard, i t matters importantly whether increased fiscal  deficits predominantly raise aggregate demand or also  expand the supply potential of the economy more broadly ."
 Changes in fiscal policy that raise the level or growth rate of productivity or that induce greater labor force participation and hig her levels of skill and                                                  6 See Brainard (2015).
" The higher productivity and workforce levels engendered by these policies would likely increase investment opportunities and raise expectations of future income growth, sustainably boosting the level s of investment and consumption and, as a result, the longer -run neutral rate."
" In recent years, major foreign economies have been contending with a deficiency of domestic demand."
" At a time when the U.S. economy  has made important progress on employment and inflation , in both Europe and Japan output or inflation, or both, remain well be low desired levels."
" Moreover , growth in many emerging market economies, including importantly China,  has slowed  in recent years , and financial con ditions in some emerging economies appear fragile."
" Against the backdrop of deficient demand abroad , if more expansionary fiscal policy here at home  raises expectations of a growing divergence between the U nited States  and other economies , upward pr essure on the exchange rate will likely result, as we have seen recently  with the renewed increase in the dollar ."
" The result could be cross -border spillovers from the increase in U.S. domestic demand, re ducing the effect on U.S. real activity and inflation and potentially contributing to external imbalances."
"  In the past few years , the effect  on the dollar of in creased  expectations about divergence between U.S.  - 7 - and foreign interest rates  has been especially strong.9  The nearly 20 percent increase in the dollar over 2014 and 2015 coincided with falling real exports and import prices in the United States."
" Net exports subtracted more than  1/2 percentage poi nt from GDP growth in both 2014 and 2015, while falling nonoil import prices likely subtracted 1/4 percentag e point from the annual rate of core inflation.10   Finally, the trajectory  of federal government debt relative to GDP and views regarding the debt’s sustainability  can also influence the effects of  fiscal policy."
" Research suggests that increases i n the de btto-GDP ratio cause long -term interest rates  to rise.11  All else being equal, higher longterm interest rates reduce spending on interest -sensitive goods , possibly damping  the direct effect of fiscal expansion on economic activity ."
" The experiences of  foreign economies suggest that the  relationship between debt and interest rates is  complex and  likely nonlinear, with the influence of greater debt on interest rates rising as the debt -toGDP ratio reaches a trajectory at which  investors have concerns about  its sustainability ."
" In this light, it is notable that the current ratio of debt to GDP is substantially  large r than  it was preceding the fiscal expansions  in the early 1980s and early 2000s  and has  already been projected to increase further based on demo graphic trends .12 Guideposts for M onetary  Policy  With any future change in fiscal policy quite uncertain, monetary policy will be guided by the current state of the economy, the underlying momentum of economic                                                  9 See Cucuru (forthcoming)."

"  - 8 - activity and inflation, the level of the neutra l rate, and the balance of macroeconomic risks."
" Following a year in which the unemployment rate remained stable while labor force participation increased, we have seen in the past quarter a further reduction in the unemployment rate."
" Overall, I am pleased to see that full employment is within reach and could prove sustainable with the right policy mix."
" Payroll  growth  has remained sufficiently  strong to continue eroding slack, increasingly along margins that had previously seemed stubbornly elevated-- including the long -term unemployed, those on the margins of  the labor force, and most recently those who are working part  time but would prefer fulltime work."
" Moreover, wage  growth  appears to be picking up gradually  in a further sign that slack continues to be taken up."
" While the  employment cost index was up only 2.3 percent over the 12 months ending in September, still well below pre -crisis no rms, average hourly earnings have accelerated more noticeably, increasing by 2.9 percent on a 12month basis in December ."
" Even so, some  slack  may remain:   Relative to pre -crisis levels,  the prime -age employment -topopulation ratio remains  low and the shar e of employees working part  time for e conomic reasons remains elevated ."
"  Following a long period of stubbornly below -target inflation, I have been encouraged by recent signs of gradual progress toward our inflation target , as the effects of earlier dollar  appreciation and oil price declines appear to be waning ."
" This rate is still noticeably below 2 percent, but it is up  - 9 - 1/4 percentage point from a year earlier.13  In addition, market measures of longer -run inflation compensation based on nominal and inflationprotected T reasur y yields have improved about 40 basis points relative to the  very depressed levels prevail ing through much of the preceding  year, although, even with this increase, inflation compensation remains well below historical norms."
 How quickly remaining slack is  utilized  and inflation returns to target de pends on future growth in activity.
"  When the economy eventually returns to full employment and 2 percent inflation, the appropriate level of the federal funds rate will depend on the level of the neutral rate , which is expected to move up only  modestly in coming years  from its current low level .14  On the one hand, i f progress on employment and inflation occur s more quickly than I anticipate , foreign risks  recede, and the fiscal impulse rise s, the neutral rate might rise more rapidly ."
" With weak domestic demand abroad, further tightening of financial conditions through the exchange rate could lead to some spillover of  demand across borders , weigh ing on U.S. exports, investment, and manufac turing activity and potentially constraining the neutral rate."
"  Finally, how strongly  monetary policy should react to signs of further progress toward full employment and 2 percent inflation naturally  depend s on the balance of risks."
" Given the recent imp rovement in unemployment and inflation and the possibility of increased  fiscal stimulus , risks in the domestic economy  are close r to being balanced  than they have been for some time."
" W hile great uncertainty regarding the path of fiscal policy and its econ omic effects will remain for some time, with the economy get ting closer to full employment, the prospect of a material increase in  fiscal stimulus  over a sustained period could reasonably be expected to shift some what greater  probability toward                                                  14 Of course, the neutral rate is not directly observable, and we will only be able to gauge its level by observing the momentum of economic activity and the extent to which the momentum is putting upward pressure on resource constraints and inflation."
  - 11 - stronger inflation outcomes .
" With  a low U.S. neutral rate, conventional  U.S. monetary policy does not have as much room as  it did prior  to the financial crisis to counter adverse shocks from abroad."
" The  effects will depend on the timing, magnitude, and composition of the polici es, the extent to which the policies boost aggregate supply relative to aggregate demand, the cyclical position of the economy, and the responses of the dollar and longer -term interest rates , given the fragile global economic environme nt and  projections for  the U.S. debt -toGDP ratio."
" Against this uncertain  backdrop, monetary policy will continue to be guided by actual and expected progress toward our goals, the level of the neutral rate, and the balance of risks."
" A  gradual approach will remain appropriate a s long as inflationary pressure s remain muted, the economy remains short of our objectives, the neutral rate remains low, and downside risks from abroad remain, although this  will depend on t he fiscal trajectory , as it evolves, and i ts uncertain effects  on the economy and financial markets."
