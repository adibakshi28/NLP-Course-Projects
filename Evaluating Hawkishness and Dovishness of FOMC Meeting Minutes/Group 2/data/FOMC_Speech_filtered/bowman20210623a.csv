 These discussions will be the first of several aimed at continuing the Fed Listens  initiative that began in 2019 and was part of the Federal Reserve’s broad review of its monetary policy framework.
 The initial purpose of Fed Listens  was to interact in a public setting with members of the public and community groups to hear about issues relating to our dual -mandate goals of maximum employment and price stability.
" Economic output has likely surpassed its pre -pandemic peak , but even with this progress, there are over 10 million people still without jobs who are either actively looking for employment or have since left the labor force."
" Employment has been recovering rapidly in the sectors of the economy related to goods production and sales, but the services economy has been much slower to recover."
" Employment in the leisure and hospitality sector s is down by more than 3 million jobs since  February  of 2020.1   As the recovery in the labor market and spending on goods and se rvices continues to gain momentum, we are seeing upward pressures on consumer prices."
" In recent months, inflation has risen t o well over the Federal Reserve’s long errun goal of 2 percen t."
" This rise has reflected, in part, the fact that inflation numbers  at the onset of the pandemic were very low."
" As those low values drop out of the 12month average of price changes, th is measure of inflation has increased and will likely increase further ."
But there is more to the recent rise in inflation than just these  measurement issues.
 The impressive upswing in economic activity has played an important role as it has led to a number of supply chain bottlenecks and put upward pressure on prices for many goods.
"  These upward price pressures may ease as the bottlenecks  are worked out , but it could take  1 See U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, “Employment Situation Summary,” news release, June 4, 2021, https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm ."

" In the  Federal Reserve’s  2021 Small Business Credit Survey , 52 percent of  Asian -owned , nonemployer small businesses reported their financial conditions as poor, compared w ith 38  percent of Hispanic -, 36 percent of Black -, and 28 percent of White -owned firms .4   The Federal Open Market Committee view s the maximum level of employment as a broad -based and inclusive goal ."
" Thus, these gaps in employment and other measures of economic wellbeing can be interpreted to show that more progress is needed to reach maximum employment."
 The goal is to promote a n economy in which  all can contribute to and share in the benefits of economic growth.
 An environment that supports resilient small businesses means more jobs and economic growth in local communities —both urban and rural .
" In rural counties, 65  percent  of the total jobs, which is a significant majority, were provided through employment in a small business.6  Creating and encouraging an environment that supports small business growth and entrepreneurship is a vital component of economic vitality and advancing a more broadbased recovery."
" Data from the Census Bureau show that  only about 65 percent of households in both rural and lower -income counties pay to have a subscription to internet services, compared with the national average of about 80 percent.7   A report from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia also found income - and racerelated gaps in both broadband availability and adoption rates across neighborhoods in Philadelphia .8  Internet access has become necessary for those looking for a job, and, not surprisingly, the unemployment rate for those without a computer  connected to the internet was about 3  percentage points higher  than the unemployment rate for those with a computer with internet access ."
 Invest ing in the infrastructure to increase br oadband availability  and to support broadband adoption in these communities could help close the employment gaps.
" The Fed eral Reserve is committed to supporting th e economic recovery and will do so through our monetary policy tools, supervisory responsibilities , and community  7 See Michael J."
