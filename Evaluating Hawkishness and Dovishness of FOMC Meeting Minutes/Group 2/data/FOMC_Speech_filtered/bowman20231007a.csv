" Before we turn to our c onversation, I’d like to offer a few thoughts on the economy and monetary policy, in light of  our Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting last month ."
" As you know, at that meeting, my colleagues and I voted to maintain the target range for the federal  funds rate at 5¼ to 5½ percent, after raising rates sharply over the past year and a half to reduce inflation."
" Since then , there has been  considerable progress on lowering inflation , and the FOMC has responded this year with a more gradual pace of increases ."
"  Inflation continues to be  too high, and I expect it will likely be appropriate for the Committe e to raise rates further and hold them at a restrictive level for some time to return inflation to our 2 percent goal in a timely way."
"   - 2 - Most recently, the latest inflation reading based on the personal consumption expenditure (PCE) index showed that ove rall inflation rose, responding in part to higher oil prices."
 I see a continued risk that high energy prices could reverse some of the progress we have seen on inflation in recent months.
"  At the same time, the economy has remained strong as the FOMC has tightened monetary policy."
 The most recent employment report showed a labor market wit h solid job gains.
" The average pace of job gains over the past year has slowed somewhat and the labor force participation rate has also improved over the same time frame, a sign that labor market supply and demand may be coming into better balance."
 Banks have tighten ed lending standards due to  higher interest rates and  funding costs and in anticipation of future regulatory requirements.
" But d espite this tightening of lending standards, there has not been a sharp contraction in credit  that would significantly slow economic activity ."
" Bank loan balance growth has slowed, but ongoing strong household and business balance sheets combined with the growing importance of nonbank lending suggest  that monetary policy may have smaller effects on bank lending and the economy than in the past."
   Given the mixed data releases  recently —strong spending data but a decline in inflation and downward revisions to jobs created in previous months —I supported  the FOMC’s decision to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate.
" Since then, the GDP and employment data ha ve also been revised."
  But I continue to expect that further policy tightening will likely  be needed to return inflation  to 2 percent in a timely way.
 The Summary of Economic Projections released in connection with the September FOMC meeting showed that  the median participant  expects inflation to stay above 2 percent at least until the end of 2025.
" This, along with my own expectation that progress on inflation is likely to be slow given the current level of monetary policy restraint, suggests that further policy tightening wi ll be needed to bring inflation down in a sustainable and timely manner."
 It is important to note that monetary policy is not on a pre -set course.
 I remain willing to support raising the federal funds rate at a future meeting if the incoming data indicates that progress on inflation has stalled or is too slow to bring inflation to 2 percent in a timely way.
 Returning inflation to the FOMC’s  2 percent goal is necessary to achieve a sustainably strong labor market and an economy that works for everyone.
