 I will begin with the economy and the road ahead for monetary policy before briefly discussing the Fed eral Reserve ’s monetary policy independence.
"  Over the past year, inflation has come down significantly but is still running above the Federal Open Market Committee’s  (FOMC) 2  percent goal ."
" In February, headline inflation was 2.5  percent  over the past 12 months based on the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index."
" Core inflation, which excludes the volatile food and energy components, stood at 2 .8 percent ; a year ago , it was 4.8  percent ."
" While this progress is welcome, the job of sustainably restoring 2  percent inflation is not yet done."
"   Tight m onetary policy continues to weigh on demand, particularly in interest -sensitive spending categories."
" Nonetheless, growth in economic activity and employment was strong in 2023, as real gross domestic product expanded more than 3  percent and 3 million jobs were created, even as inflation fell substantially."
 This combination of outcomes reflects significant improvements in supply that offset to some extent the effects on demand of tighter financial conditions.
" The healing of global supply chains helped address  pentup demand for goods, particularly in sectors that had faced considerable shortages, such as autos."
 Recent readings on both job gains  and inflation have come in  higher  than expected .
 And the higher  - 2 - inflation data over January and February were above the low readings  in the second half of last year.
"  The recent data do not, however, materially change the overall picture, which continues to be one of solid growth, a strong but rebalancing labor market, and inflation moving down to ward  2 percent on a sometimes  bumpy  path."
" Labor market rebalancing is evident  in data on quits, job openings, surveys of employers and workers, and the continued gradual decline in wage growth."
" On inflation, it is too soon to say whether the recent  readings represent more than just a bump."
 We do not expect that it will be appropriate to lower our policy rate until we have greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably down toward 2 percent.
" Given the strength of the economy and progress o n inflation so far, we have time to let t he incoming data guide our decisions on policy."
 Reducing rates too soon or too much could result in a reversal of the progress we have seen on inflation and ultimately require even tighter policy to get inflation back to 2 percent.
 But easing  policy too late or too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment.
" As progress on inflation continues and labor market tightness eases, these risks continue to move into better balance."
" We are making decisions meeting by meeting, and we will do everything we can to achieve our maximum -employment and price -stability goals."
  The Fed has been assigned two goals for monetary policy —maximum employment and stable prices.
" To support our pursuit of those goals,  Congress granted the Fed a substantial degree of independence in our conduct of monetary policy."
 This independence both enables and requires us to make our monetary policy decisions  without consideration of short -term political matters.
" Before 1994, the FOMC did not even announce our monetary policy decisions."
" We publish a monetary policy report twice a year , and the Chair  appear s before Congress to present that report and answer any and all questions  that are on the minds of our oversight committee members ."
" In 2020, we completed a yearlong public review of our monetary policy framework , and late this year , we will begin another such review .2  My colleagues and I explain our views on the economic outlook and monetary policy in speeches like this one, and in visits to communities across the country, as part of extensive outreach in which we  2 We expect to release the r esults of this review about a year after it begins."
