" Job gains have been robust in recent years , and the unemployment rate has declined to 4.9 percent, likely close to its long -run sustainable level."
" After running at a subdued pace during the first half of the year, gross domestic product growth has pic ked up in the most recent data, and inflation has been firming toward  the Fed eral Open Market Committee’s  2 percent target.1   Although the economy has moved back to the vicinity of the Committee ’s employment and inflation targets --suggesting that the cyclical drag on the economy has been greatly redu ced, if not largely eliminated --along some dimensions this has not been a happy recovery."
" Unease with the economy reflects a number of longer -term challenges, challenges that will require a different set of policy tools than those used to address nearer -term cyclical shortfalls in growth."
 Prominent among these challenges are low equilibrium interest rates  and sluggish productivity growth in the U nited S tates and abroad.
 I will first touch on low interest rates before turning to productivity.
"  Such low interest rates , together with only t epid growth, suggest that the equilibrium interest rate --that is , the rate that neither boosts nor slows the economy --has fallen."
" Importantly, low interest rates make the economy more vulnerable to adverse shocks by constraining the  ability of monetary policy to combat recessions using conventional interest rate policy --because the effective lower bound on                                                  1 Views expressed are mine and are not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee."
  - 2 - the interest rate means that monetary policy has less room to reduce the interest rate when that becomes necessary .
" More fundamentally, low equilibrium real rates could signal that the economy’s long -run growth prospects are dim."
"  Why are interest rates so low ?2  In a speech last month, I identified a number of factors that have worked to boost saving, depress investment, or both."
 Among the factors holding down interest rates is the sluggishness of foreign economic growth.
" Also, investment recently has been weaker than might otherwise be expected, perhaps reflecting uncertainty about longer -run growth prospects , as well as the decline in investment in the energy sector as a result of the fall i n the price of oil ."
" Finally, and most important, weak productivity growth has likely  pushed down interest rates  both by lowering  investment, as firms lower their expectations for the marginal return on investment , and by increasing  saving,  as consumers lo wer their expectations for income growth and borrow less and/or save more as a consequence."
 Understanding the recent weakness of productivity growth is central to addressing the longer -run challenges confronting the economy.
 Productivity growth over the past decade has been lackluster by post -World War II standards.
" Output per hour increased only 11/4 percent per year , on average , from 2006 to 2015, compared with its long -run                                                  2 See Stanley Fischer (2016), “Why Are Interest Rates So Low?"
" This halving of productivity grow th, if it were to persist, would have wide -ranging consequences for living standards, wage growth, and economic policy more broadly."
" A number of explanations have been offered for the decline in productivity growth, including mismeasurement in the officia l statistics, depressed capital investment, and a falloff in business dynamism, with reality likely reflecting some combination of all of these factors  and more ."
"     We should also consider the possibility that weak demand has played a role in holding bac k productivity growth, although standard economic textbooks generally trace a path from productivity growth to demand rather than vice versa."
" Chair Yellen recently spoke on the influence of demand on aggregate supply.3  In her speech , she reviewed a body of literature that suggests that demand conditions can have persistent effects on supply.4  In most of the literature, these effects are thought to occur through hysteresis in labor markets ."
" But there are likely also some channels through which low aggreg ate demand could affect productivity, perhaps by lowering research -anddevelopment  spending  or decreasing the pace of firm formation and innovation."
 I  believe that the relationship between productivity growth and the strength of aggregate demand is an area where further research is required.
"  4 See, for example, Olivier Blanchard, Eugenio Cerutti, and Lawrence Summers (2015) , “Inflation and Activity --Two Explorations and Their Monetary Policy Implications,” IMF Working Paper WP/15/230 (Wash ington:  International Monetary Fund, November), https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2015/wp15230.pdf ; and Dave Reifschneider, William Wasc her, and David Wilcox (2015),  “Aggregate  Supply in the United States:  Recent Developments and Implications for the Conduct of Monetary Policy, ” IMF Economic Review,  vol."
"  - 4 - I will conclude by reiterating one aspect of the low interest rate and low productivity growth problems that I have mentioned previously --the fact that , for several years , the Fed has been close to being “ the only game in town,”  as Mohamed El -Erian  described it  in his recent book.5  But m acroeconomic policy does not have to be confined to monetary policy."
" C ertain fiscal policies, particularly those that increase productivity, can increase the potential of th e economy and help confront some of our longer -term economic challenges ."
" While there is disagreement about what the most effective policies would be, some combination of improved public infrastructure, better education, more encouragement for private inve stment, and more  effective regulation all likely have a role to play in promoting faster growth of productivity and living standards ."
" By raising equilibrium interest rates, such policies may also reduc e the probability that the economy, and the Federal Reserve, will have to contend more than is necessary with the effective lower bound on interest rates ."
