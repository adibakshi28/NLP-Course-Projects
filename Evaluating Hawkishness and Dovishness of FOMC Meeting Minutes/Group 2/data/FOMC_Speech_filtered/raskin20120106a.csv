" Against th at backdrop, I appreciat e the opportunity to speak at the First Friday Economic Outlook, at  the start of a promising new year, and share my thoughts with you on two vitally impor tant topics:  how the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy aims to increase the availabi lity of credit to fost er economic growth, and how we are tailoring our examination and supe rvision of community banks to ensure that we are not inadvertently constraining lending."
"Monetary Policy and Credit Availability To gain some perspective on this issue, let’s set aside for a moment the beautiful Eastern Shore and the examiners in their new businesscasual attire, taking the bus to the banks, and approach examination and superv ision from the perspective of monetary macroeconomics and the Federal Reserve’s deci sionmaking over the past several years."
" By the end of 2009, the unemployment rate reached a horrifying 10 percent, corre sponding to more than 15 million Americans being out of work, with all of  the attendant social conse quences--including lost income and wealth, mortgage foreclosures, family  strains, health problems, and so on."
" Although measures of  community banks’ profitability have risen from their recession lows, pressures on the ba nks’ profitability and credit quality remain as a result of the lingering weak macroec onomic fundamentals, especially the stubbornly high amount of unemployment."
"In that regard, although the pace of empl oyment growth has picked up in recent months and the unemployment rate has fallen some, the labor market remains quite weak."
 And almost half of that group--nearly 1 million individuals--had given up searching for employment altogether because th ey did not believe any jobs were available to them.
  The Federal Reserve’s monetary policy has been accommodative since the onset of the financial crisis.
"Given the magnitude of the financial cris is and its aftermath, the Federal Reserve clearly needed to provide additional monetary accomm odation beyond simply keeping shortterm interest rates close to zero."
" Broadly speaking, these policy tools aff ect the economy through channels that are similar to those of conventional monetary policy."
" Specifi cally, forward guidance and balance sheet operations have been employed to put downward pressure on interest rates; lower interest rates, in turn, reduce the co sts of borrowing for households and businesses and also boost household wealth, thereby pr oviding economic stimulus."
"In my judgment, our deployment of unconventional policy tools has been completely appropriate to help promote th e Federal Reserve’s statutory mandate of maximum employment and price stability."
" Id eally, monetary policy decisions would be informed by precise quantitative information about the effects of each tool."
" That said, even in normal times, uncertainty is intrinsic to realworld monetary policymak ing."
" Uncertainty about the effects of policy is particular ly relevant under current circ umstances where the scope for - 8 -  conventional monetary policy is constraine d by the zero lower bound on the federal funds rate, leaving unconventional tools as the only means of providing further monetary accommodation."
"  However, certain factors could be co nstraining the channels through which monetary policy accommodation affects the economy."
" If times were more typical, we would expect a smooth transmissi on in which lower interest rates would fuel credit expansion that would be used to finance expanding payrolls, capital investment, inventories, and other shortterm operating e xpenses."
" Risks at community banks tend to arise from their lendin g activities, whether in the form of credit or interest rate risk, and a lack of diversific ation can exacerbate these risks."
" Arguably, the financial crisis revealed that at  many of the largest firms, the sophistication of these banks’ governance, controls, and risk  management did not keep pace with the rapid growth of risk."
" Ideally, our supervisory policies result in stronger community banks that  are able to lend and promote sustainable economic growth in their communities."
