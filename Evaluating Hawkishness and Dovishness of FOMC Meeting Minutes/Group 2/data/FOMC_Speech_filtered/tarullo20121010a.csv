" Twenty years be fore the New Deal, the creation of the Federal Reserve had been intended at least as much as a financial stability measure as an instrument of monetary policy."
" Most other banking law changes of the 1980s and 1990s, culminating in the GrammLeach-Bliley Act in 1999, were essentially deregulatory.1  These laws, along with the administrative actions that both preceded and implemented them, removed many restrictions on activities, affiliations, and the geographic reach  of commercial banks without substituting new regulatory mechanisms to control the institutionspeci fic risks that could arise from the growth of financial services conglomerates, much less the sy stemic risks created by th e rapid integration of capital markets and traditional lending activities.2  The major regulatory initiative of this period was the Basel II package of changes to capital requirements, an exercise whose shortcomings included an enhancement, rather than diminuti on, of regulatory incentive for procyclicality in bank lending, and thus could arguably increase systemic risk."
" Yet the statute itself provides  only limited guidance to regulators on how to implement financial stability where it is establ ished as a standard, or how to weigh it against - 9 -  economic growth and other considerations wher e it is used as an informing concept for a regulatory exercise or a factor to be considered in regulatory approvals."
" It means that the current structure for financial stability regulation permits  substantial increases in systemic risk by an institution, so long as it is generated from internal  growth."
" In additio n to the virtue of simplicity, this approach has the advantage of tying the limitati on on growth of financial firms to the growth of the national economy and its capacity to absorb losses, as we ll as to the extent of a firm’s dependence on funding from sources other than the stable base  of deposits."
