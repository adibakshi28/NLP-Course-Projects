"Bowman   Member    Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at  “Fed Listens : Community Listening Session”  hosted by  the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta   Atlanta, Georgia         August 7, 2023      Thank you, President Bostic.1  When the Board began the Fed Listens  initiative, our purpose was to engage directly with the public to discuss issues related to our monetary policy decision -making framework and our efforts to pursue the congressionally -mandated monetary policy goals of  price stability and maximum employment."
 I look forward to hearing from today’s participants about how inflation and higher interest rates are affecting their day -today decision making.
" As man y of you know, since March of last year the FOMC has significantly increased the federal funds rate, which is our primary monetary policy tool."
 The goal is to raise interest rates throughout the economy to bring demand into better balance with supply and reduce upward pricing pressures.
"  We have made progress in lowering inflation over the past year, but inflation is still significantly above the FOMC’s two percent target, and the labor market continues to be tight,  1 The views expressed here are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee or the Board of Governors."
" Economic activity has grown at a moderate pace, and even as banks have been tightening their lending standards in response to higher interest rates and funding costs, lending to businesses and households has continued to ex pand."
"  Given these developments, I supported raising the federal funds rate at our July meeting, and I expect that additional increases will likely be needed to lower inflation to the FOMC’s goal."
" Of course, monetary policy is not on a pre -set path, and I will be closely monitoring the incoming data and their implications for the economic outlook."
" I will be looking for evidence that inflation is on a consistent and meaningful downward path as I consider whether further increases in the federal funds rate  will be needed, and how long the federal funds rate will need to remain at a sufficiently restrictive level."
"   I know that high inflation has been a hardship, especially for lower - and middle -income families, who spend the majority of their income on nece ssities."
 Returning inflation to two percent will help American families focus on important decisions other than inflation.
 Addressing high inflation will ensure that it is no longer a factor for spending and investment decisions and will help put the U.S .
economy on a course of ongoing economic growth and rising standards of living.
" But I also know that higher interest rates have made it more difficult for many to get a loan, to buy a home or a car, and for businesses to invest and expand."
 I am interest ed to hear the ways in which inflation and higher interest rates are affecting the day -today lives of our participants today.
" Over the past few years, for many, wage and salary increases have not kept up with -3inflation, and while that general pattern has improved recently, most workers still have not seen wage increases e qual to price increases."
" We also know from history that a slower economy, with higher unemployment, tends to hit lower -income workers the hardest, so we must remain attuned to the fact that our efforts  to reduce inflation have the potential to undermine wage gains  and job security for lower -wage workers."
" Should inflation remain at today’s level, or increase again, lower -wage workers would continue to bear the brunt of these effects."
" Small businesses ar e also more vulnerable in an economic slowdown than larger businesses, and I am watching carefully to see how they are dealing with both inflation and higher interest rates."
" Despite high inflation and significant challenges finding workers in a tight labor market, the past few years have been relatively good for small businesses and for new business formation."
"    New businesses have also been responsible for a surprising amount of job growth, with an average of one million jobs created each quarter from early 2021 through the end of last year, which is a significantly higher pace than was typical prior to the pandemic.2  This extende d  2 In particular, Bureau of Labor Statistics data on jobs created by new establishments averaged 980,000 per quarter from 2020:Q3 to 2022:Q4 (the latest observation), compared with 810,000 per quarter from 2009 to 2019."
