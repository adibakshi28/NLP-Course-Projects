"For release on delivery  2:15 a.m. EDT (9:15 a.m. local time)  July 1 , 2019          The Federal Reserve’s Review of Its Monetary Policy  Strategy ,  Tools, and Communication Practices     Remarks by   Richard H ."
"Clarida   Vice Chair   Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at  “The Bank of Finland Conference on  Monetary Policy and Future of EMU  [Economic and Monetary Union]”   Helsinki, Finland        July 1 , 2019    I am delighted to be in Helsinki at this important conference on monetary  policy and the future of Europe’s monetary union.1  Today  I would like to discuss the broad review of the Federal Reserve’s  monetary policy framework that my fellow policymakers and I are undertaking this year ."
" We are  examin ing the policy strateg y, tools, and communication practices that we use to  pursue our dual -mandate goals of maximum employment and price stability."
" Nonetheless, in light of the unprecedented events of the past decade, we believe it is a good time to  step back and assess whether , and in what possible ways , we can refine our strateg y, tools, and communication practices to achieve and maintain these g oals as consistent ly and robust ly as possible.2  I note that central banks in other countries have conduct ed periodic reviews of their monetary policy frameworks, and their experience has informed the approach we are pursuing ."
 2 Fuhrer and oth ers (2018) explore the desirability of comprehensive reviews of the monetary policy framework.
"  - 2 - With the U.S. economy operating at or close to maximum employment and price stability, now is an especially opportune time to conduct this review."
" The unemployment  rate is near  a 50 -year low, and inflation is running close to our 2 percent objective."
" The decline in neutral policy rates likely reflects several factors, including aging populat ions, changes in risktaking behavior, and a slowdown in technology growth."
" That development, in turn, could make it more difficult during downtur ns for monetary  policy  to support  spending  and employment, and keep inflation from falling too low .4                                                  3 For evidence of a fall in neutral rates of interest in the United States and abroad, see, among several contributions, King and Low (2014) ; Holston, Laubach, and Williams (2017) ; Rachel and Smith (201 7); and Brand, Bielecki, and Penalver (2018)."
" 4 For assessments of the risks that U.S. monetary policy will be constrained by the ELB and its implications for economic activity and inflation, see Kiley and Roberts (2017), Erceg and others (2018), Swanson  (2018), and Chung and others (2019)."
  - 3 - Another key development in recent decades is that inflation appears less responsive to resource slack .
" That is, the short -run Phillips curve appears to have flattened , implying a change in the dynamic relationship between inflation and employment.5  A flatter Phillips curve is, in a sense, a proverbial double -edged sword ."
" It permits the Federal Reserve to support employment more aggressively during downt urns—as was the case during and after the Great Recession —because a sustained inflation breakout is less likely when the  Phillips curve  is flatter .6  However, a flatter Phillips curve  also increases the cost, in terms of economic output, of reversing  unwel come increases in longer -run inflation expectations ."
" Thus, a flatter Phillips curve makes it all the more  important that longer -run inflation expectations remain anchored at levels consistent with our  2 percent inflation objective .7 Finally, the strengthe ning of the labor market in recent years has highlighted the challenges of assessing the proximity of the labor market to full employment."
"6 One potential contributor to the flattening of the Phillips curve is a ch ange in the conduct of monetary policy since the 1980s toward greater stabilization of inflation and economic activity; for evidence of such a change, see Clarida, Galí, and Gertler (2000) ; Boivin and Giannoni (2006) ; and Boivin, Kiley, and Mishkin (2010 )."
" Similarly, the adoption of an explicit inflation objective, along w ith greater certainty regarding the conduct of monetary policy, can help anchor longer -term inflation expectations and stabilize actual inflation in response to shocks."
 7 See Yellen (2015) for a discussion of inflation dynamics and monetary policy ; see Erceg and others (2018) for a quantitative exploration of the monetary policy implications of a flat Phillips curve in an uncertain economic environment.
" Since the mid -1980s, movements in both realized inflation and measures of longer -term inflation expectations have been somewhat muted, complicating the task of extracting the precise role of inflation expectations as a determinant of realized inflation."
 Faust and Wright (2013) review the literature on inflation forecasting and present evidence in support of  the conclusion that measures of inflation expectations help predict the trend in inflation.
" Cecchetti and others (2017) showed that while the level of realized inflation and four -quarter -ahead inflation expectations are positively correlated, changes in these variables have been largely uncorrelated since the mid -1980s."
" These authors suggest that, in a low and stable inflation environment, policymakers should pay attention to a wide array of other indicators in determining the implications of movements in realized inflation and measures of inflation expectations."
"  - 4 - unemployment rate, which stood at 3.6 percent in Ma y, has been interpreted by many as suggesting that the labor market is currently operating beyond full employment."
" However, the level of the unemployment rate that is consistent with full employment is not directly observable and thus must be estimated."
" For example, in the Summary of Economic Projections submitted in conjunction with the June meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the ra nge of estimates for the longer -run normal unemployment rate is 3.6 to 4.5 percent.8 The decline in the unemployment rate in recent years has been accompanied  by a  pronounced increase in labor force participation  for individuals in their prime working years.9  These increases in prime -age participation have provided employers with a source of additional labor input and ha ve been one factor restraining inflationary pressures."
" As with the unemployment rate, whether participation will continue to increase in a tight labor market remains uncer tain."
" For example, African Americans and Hispanics have experienced persistently higher unemployment rates than whites for many decades.10  However, those unemployment rate gaps have narrowed as the labor market has strengthened, and there is some indication of an extra benefit to                                                  8 The box “How Tight Is the Labor Market?” in the Board’s February 2018 Monetary Policy Report  contains a discussion of some indicators that can be used to assess labor market tightness; see Boar d of Governors (2018a, pp."
"9 The box “The Labor Force Participation Rate for Prime -Age Individuals” in the Board’s July 2018 Monetary Policy Report  contains a discussion of recent developments in labor force participation rates for prime -age individuals; see Board of Governors (2018b, pp."
"  - 5 - these groups as the unemployment rate moves into very low territory.11  Likewise, although unemployment rates for less -educated workers are persistently higher than  they are for their more -educated counterparts, such gaps appear to narrow as the labor market strengthens.12  And wage increases in the past couple of years have been strongest for lesseducated workers and for those at the lower end of the wage distribution.13 Scope of the Review  In the Federal Reserve Act, the Congress assigned the Federal Reserve the responsibility to conduct monetary policy “so as to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long -term interest rates.”14  Our review this year takes  this statutory m andate as given and also takes  as given that inflation at a rate of 2 percent is most consistent over the longer run with the congressional  mandate."
"  Our existing monetary policy strategy is laid out in the Committee’s Statement  on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy.15  First adopted in January 2012, the                                                  11 See Aaronson and others (2019) for evidence on the relative behavior of unemployment rates by race and ethnicity in a strong labor market."
 The authors find similar patterns for labor force participation rates and for employment -topopulation ratios.
" The box “Employment Disparities between Rural and Urban Areas” in the Board’s February 2019 Monetary Policy Report  examines these disparities in more detail; see Board of Governors (2019, pp."
" 14 Even though the a ct lists three distinct goals, the Federal Reserve ’s mandate for monetary policy is commonly known as the “dual mandate.”  The reason is that an economy in which people who want to  work either have a job or are likely to find one fairly quickly and in which the price level (meaning a broad measure of the price of goods and services purchased by consumers) is stable creates the conditions needed for interest rates to settle at modera te levels."
 The  statement indicates  that the Committee seeks to mitigate deviations  of inflatio n from 2 percent and deviations of employment from assessments of its maximum level.
" In doing so, the FOMC recognizes that these assessments of maximum employment are necessarily uncertain and subject to revision."
" According to the Federal Reserve Act , the employment objective  is on an equal footing with the inflation objective."
" As a practical matter, our current strategy shares many elements with the policy  framework known in the research literature as  “flexible inflation targeting .”16  However, the Fed’s mandate is much more explicit about the role of employment than that of most flexible inflation -targeting central banks, and our statement reflects this by stating that when the two sides of the mandate are in conflict, neither one takes precedent over the  other."
 We believe this transparency about the balanced approach the FOMC takes has served us well over the past decade when high unemployment called for extraordinary policies that entailed some risk of inflation.
"Three Questions  The first question is , “Can the Fed eral Reserve best meet its statutory  objectives with its existing monetary policy strategy, or should it consider strategies  that aim to reverse past misses of the inflation objective?”                                                   16 For a discussion of this termino logy and references, see English, LópezSalido, and Tetlow (2015) and Clinton and others (2015)."
"  - 7 - Under our current approach as well as that of most  flexible inflation -target ing central banks around the world, the persistent shortfalls of inflation from 2 percent  that many advanced economies have  experienced over most of the past decade are treated as “bygones .”  This mean s that policy today is not adjusted to offset past  inflation  shortfalls with future overshoots of the inflation target (nor do persistent  overshoots of inflation trigger policies that aim to undershoot the inflation target)."
" Central banks are generally  believed to have effective tools for preventing persistent inflation overshoots, but the ELB on interest rates makes persistent u ndershoots more  likely."
" Persistent inflation shortfalls  carry the risk that longer -term inflation expectations become poorly anchored or become anchored below the stated inflation goal.17 In part because of that concern, some economists have advocated “mak eup” strategies under which policymakers seek to undo, in part or in whole, past inflation deviations from target."
" Such strategies include targeting average inflation over a multiyear period and price -level targeting , in which policymakers seek to stabili ze the price level around a constant growth path.18  These strategies could be implemented                                                  17 These risks could be exacerbated if households and businesses expect monetary policy to be insufficiently accommodative because of proximity to the ELB."
 18 Eggertsson and Woodford (2003) provide an early discussion of how optimal monetary policy at the ELB entails a commitment to reflate the price level during the subsequent economic expansion.
 Nessén and Vestin (2005) discuss the relationship between avera ge inflation targeting and price -level targeting.
 There is a dearth of empirical evidence on strategies seeking to make up for inflation deviations.
 Central banks that pursue an inflation goal generally seek to achieve a specific rate of inflation by som e time horizon —typically a couple of years ahead or over the “medium run” —without regard to past inflation deviations.
" One exception is the Reserve Bank of Australia, whose inflation goal is specified as a range of  “2–3 per cent, on average, over the med ium term” and thus might embed some notion of history dependence."
" However, Ruge -Murcia (2014) argues that the drift in the price level in Australia is comparable with the drifts observed in economies with purely forward -looking specification of the inflation goal."
"  For example, the central bank could commit, at the time when the policy rate reaches the ELB, to maintain the policy rate at this level until inflation over the ELB period has, on average, run at the target rate.19  Other makeup strategies seek to reverse shortfalls in policy accommodation at the ELB by keeping the policy rate lower for longer than otherwise  would be the case .20  In many models that incorporate the ELB, these makeup  strategies lead to better average performance on both legs of the dual mand ate and thereby, viewed over time, provide no conflict between the dual -mandate goals.21 The benefits of the makeup strategies rest heavily on households and firms believing in advance that the makeup will, in fact, be delivered when the time comes —for exam ple, that a persistent inflation shortfall will be met by future inflation above  2 percent."
"  As is well known from the research  literature, makeup strategies , in general , are not time consistent because when the time comes to push inflation above 2 percent , conditions at that time will not warrant doing so ."
 See also Kiley and Roberts (2017) for a strategy in which policymakers aim for inflation higher than 2 percent during economic expansions to compensate for below -target realizations of inflation dur ing economic downturns.
"  The box “Complexities of Monetary Policy Rules” in the Board’s July 2018 Monetary Policy Report  contains an application of such a modified rule ; see Board of Governors (2018b, pp."
"  The next question the review will consider is , “Are the existing monetary policy  tools adequate to achieve and maintain maximum employment and price stability, or should the toolkit be expanded?"
" And, if so, how?”  The FOMC’s primary means of changing the stance of monetary policy is by adjusting its target range for the federal  funds rate."
" Overall, the empirical evidence suggests that these added tools helped stem  the crisis and support economic recovery by strengthening the labor market and lifting inflation back toward 2 percent."
"  In addition to using these two additional monetary policy tools, the Federal Reser ve implemented a number of other measures to stabilize the financial system, increase households and business confidence, and more generally support the economic recovery."
" These enhancements include the Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy; postmeeting press conferences; various statements  about the principles and strategy guiding the Committee’s normalization of monetary policy; and quarterly summaries of individual FOMC participants ’ economic projections, assessments about the appropriate path of the federal funds rate, and judgments of t he uncertainty and balance of risks  around their projections .24                                                  effects of balance sheet policies, see Gagnon and others (2011), Joyce and others (2011), Hamilton and Wu (2012), D’Amico and King (2013), and Swanson (2017 )."
"24 Starting in 1979, the Federal Reserve published a summary of individual economic projections from various Board members, FOMC members, or FOMC participants in the semiann ual Monetary Policy Report."
" For example, there might be ways to improve c ommunication about the coordination of policy tools or the interplay between monetary policy and financial stability."
" I  woul d like to give a brief summary of what we heard there:  Janice Eberly, James Stock, and Jonathan Wright provided a thorough and thoughtful evaluation of the Fede ral Reserve’s monetary policy strategy, tools, and communications since 2009."
" Lars Svensson evaluated the pros and cons of several monetary policy strategies that have makeup features, and argued that average inflation targeting could be more likely than price -level targeting to be understood by the public and garner credibility."
"In other sessions, Kat harine Abraham and John Haltiwanger developed  an innovative search -andmatching model to estimate labor market slack —which complements the standard estimates based on unemployment gaps and Phillips curve relationships."
" Maurice Obstfeld  examined the ways t hat global economic integration affects inflation and the neutral rate of interest , and the role played by the U.S. dollar in transmitting the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy to other countries."
  Anil Kashyap and Caspar Siegert spoke about the interplay between financial stability considerations  and monetary policy.
" (You can view videos of the events or read the summaries on our website.)  In coming regularly scheduled FOMC meetings, we will begin our own assessment of our monetary policy strategy, tools, and communication practices , informed by what we heard at the  conf erence and during  our listening sessions in the Federal Reserve Districts and by the work of our  staff."
