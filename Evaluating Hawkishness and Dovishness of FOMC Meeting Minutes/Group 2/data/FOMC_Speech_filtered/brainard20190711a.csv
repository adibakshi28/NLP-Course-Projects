 Last week’s strong jobs report provided reassurance that employment has continued to expand at a healthy pace.
" The unemployment rate remains near a 50 -year low, wages are growing at a moderate pace, the percentage of prime -age adults who are employed is close to its pre -crisis peak , and claims have been hovering a round historic  lows."
" Furthermore, financial conditions overall remain quite supportive  of continued employment and output growth."
" - 2 - Over the past year, inflation has fallen short of the Federal Reserve’s 2  percent objective, and that has been the case more often than not in recent years."
" On the one hand, t hat means the economy can continue to grow without pushing inflation too high."
" On the other hand, inflation that runs too low for long periods can pose difficult challenges."
 Below -target inflation reduces the amount of room the Federal Reserve has to cut  the federal funds rate to cushion the economy from negative developments .
" And it could lead people to lower their expectations for future inflation , which in turn could lead to an increasing shortfall of inflation from our objective .1  Indeed, some indic ators of longer -run inflation expectations have been on the soft side  in recent months ."
"  Putting all of the pieces together, it appears the economy has been doing well so far this year, bolstered by confident  consumers and a strong job market."
" And after fluctuations earlier in the year, financial markets currently appear supportive of growth, with borrowing rates low and the stock market at  alltime highs ."
  Taking into account the downside risks at a time when inflation is on the soft side would argue for soften ing the expected path of monetary policy according to basic principles of risk management.
" When nominal interest rates are zero, a drop in inflation expectations can be especially problematic, making the “real” interest rates that matter for household and business decisions higher  than they would otherwise be  and therefore less supportive of growth."
 The area’s unemployment rate is close to its lowest level  in the past 40 years.
