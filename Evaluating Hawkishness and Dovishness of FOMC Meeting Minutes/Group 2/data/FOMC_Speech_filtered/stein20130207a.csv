" For this reason, policymakers should be on alert any time there is rapid growth in a new product that is not yet fully understood ."
"  - 6 - example, a prolonged period of low interest rates, of the sort we are experiencing today, can create incentives for agents to take on greater duration or credit risks , or to employ additional financial leverage , in an effort to “reach for yield .”11  An insurance company that has offered guaranteed minimum rates of return on some of its products  might find its solvency threatened by a long stretch of low rates and feel compelled to take on added risk.12  A similar logic applies to a bank whose net interest margins are under pressure because low rates erode the profitability of its deposit -taking franchise."
" For example,  if low interest rates increase the demand by agents to engage in below -theradar forms of risktaking, this  demand  may prompt innovations that facilitate this sort of risk -taking."
" In principle, what we’d really like to know, for any given asse t class --be it subprime mortgages, junk bonds, or leveraged loans --is this:  What fraction of it is ultimately financed by short -term demandable claims held by investors who are likely to pull back quickly when things start to go bad?"
" If relatively illiquid junk bonds or leveraged loans are held by open -end investment vehicles such as  mutual funds or by exchange -traded funds (ETFs), and if investors in these vehicles seek to withdraw at the first sign of trouble, then this demandable equity  will have the same fire -salegenerating properties as short -term debt.18  One is naturally inclined  to look at data on short -term debt like repo, given its prominence in the recent crisis."
" Assets under management  in these vehicles were essentially flat in the years leading up to the crisis, but they have increased sharply in the past couple of years.19  This observation  suggests, albeit only loosely, that there may be some substitutability between different forms o f demandable finance."
" While demand for leveraged loans from CLOs may play a role in driving loan issuance, pricing and loan structure, it should be noted that CLO  equity  does not represent a form of demandable short -term financing    and hence do es not have the potential to contribute to fire -sale dynamics in the same way as, say, repo financing."
" Nevertheless, it deserves to be highlighted because it is exa ctly the kind of activity where new regulation could create the potential for rapid growth and where we therefore need to be especially watchful."
" But with a variety of new regulatory and institutional initiatives on the horizon that will likely increase the demand for pristine co llateral --from the Basel III Liquidity Coverage Ratio, to centralized clearing, to heightened margin requirements for noncleared swaps --there appear s to be the potential for rapid growth in this area."
" Some evidence suggestive of this growth potential is s hown in exhibit 8, which is based on responses by a range of dealer firms to the Federal R eserve’s Senior Credit Officer Opinion Survey on Dealer Financing Terms .21  As can be seen, while only a modest fraction of those surveyed reported that they were currently engaged in collateral                                                  21 The Senior Credit Officer Opinion Survey on Dealer Financing Terms is available on the Federa l Reserve’s website at www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/releases/scoos.htm ."
" However, I would like to provoke some discussion around one specific aspect of the question --namely , what are the respective roles of traditional supervisory and regulatory tools , on the one hand, versus monetary policy , on the othe r, in addressing the sorts of market -overheating phenomena that we have been talking about?"
" To lend a little concreteness and urgency to this issue, imagine that it is 18 months  from now, and that with interest rates still very low, each of the trends tha t I identified earlier has continued to build --to the point where we believe that there could be meaningful systemic implications."
" That is, monetary policy should restrict its attention to the dual  mandate goals of price stability and maximum employment, while the full battery of supervisory and regulatory tools should be used to sa feguard financial stability."
" First, monetary policy can be a blunt tool for dealing with financial  stability concerns."
" Even if we stipulate that low interest rates are part of the reason for, say, a  worrisome boom in one segment of credit markets, they are unlikely to be  the whole story."
" So , would one really want to raise rates, and risk chok ing off economic activity, in an effort to rein in that one part of the  - 16 - market?"
" A related concern is that monetary policy already has its hands full with the dual mandate, and that if it is also made partially responsible for fi nancial stability, it will have more objectives than instruments at its disposal and won’t do as well with any of its tasks.22  These are important points to bear in mind."
"  In some cases , supervisory and regulatory tools are clearly better  targeted and more  likely to be effective than monetary policy could be ."
" In spite of the caveats I just described, I can imagine situations where it might  make sense to enlist monetary policy tools in the pursuit of financial stability."
" Second, while monetary policy may  not be quite the right tool for the job, it has one important advantage relative to supervision and regulation --namely that it gets in all of the cracks."
" The one thing that a commercial bank, a broker -dealer, an offshore hedge fund, and a special  purpose ABCP  vehicle have in common is that they all fac e the same set of market interest rates."
" To see why, recall the cen tral role that maturity transformation --the fundi ng of longterm assets with short -term, run -prone liabilities --can play in propagating systemic                                                  23 A similar argument is made by Borio and Drehmann (2009), who write: “But in sophisticated and open finan cial systems, in which the scope for regulatory arbitrage is high, the interest rate has the merit of setting the universal price of leverage."
" As compared with inflation or unemployment, measurement is much harder, so even recognizing the extent of the problem in real ti me is a major challenge."
" Indeed, in some cases , it may be that the only way to achieve a meaningfully macroprudential approach to financial stability is by allowing for some greater overlap in the goals of monetary policy and regul ation."
