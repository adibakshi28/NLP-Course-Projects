" But I believe that they are crucial to str engthening the stability of our financial system and to helping restore the public’s faith in its                                                  3 For the FSB’s reform proposals, see Financial Stability Board (2014), Reforming Major Interest Rate Benchmarks  (Basel, Switzerland:  FSB, July), www.financialstabilityboard.org/publications/r_140722.pdf ."
The Basics  I will take a few moments to explain the basic mechanics of LIBOR for those who have not spent time on an interest rate swap desk.
"  - 4 - Pervasive and Problematic  When the British B anker s’ Association standardized LIBOR in the 1980s for use in interest rate products, I doubt that anyone could have imagined how pervasive it would eventually become."
" In the United States, dollar LIBOR is the reference rate used in most interest rate swaps and futures  contracts , in most floating -rate mortgages, in many commercial loans , and in structured products such as mortgage - and asse tbacked securities."
" Firms use LIBOR i n contracts , even when it is less than ideal,  because they know they can hedge the resulting risk using highly liquid , LIBOR -based interest rate swaps or other derivatives contracts ."
 These transactions are more  appropriately linked t o a narrower  measure of interest rates that does not include a bank credit risk component .

" Some derivatives , such as interest rate swaps , can be quite long lasting, and , over a long enough period of time , there is always a risk tha t any given reference rate will cease being published."
" Conclusion  My hope is that governments, market participants , and end users  can work together to build a stronger foundation for the reference interest rates that are so critical to our financial system."
