"For release on delivery  1:00 p.m. E DT May 30, 2017          Navigating the Different Signals from Inflation  and Unemployment     Remarks by   Lael Brainard   Member   Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at the  New York Association for  Business Economi cs  New York, New York         May 30, 2017    For the first time in many years, we are seeing signs of synchronized economic expansions at home and abroad, and t he bal ance of risks globally has become more positive."
" Moreover, financial conditions remain supportive of continued economic expansion despite some recent volatility.1 The ongoing progress in bringing Americans back into productive employment is especially heartening."
"  With continued strength in the labor market,  economic activity regaining momentum, and a brighter outlook abroad, it would be appropriate soon to see the federal funds rate moving closer to its neutral  level ."
"  Even so, I see some tension between signs that th e economy is in the neighborhood of full employment and indications  that the tentative progress we had seen on inflation may be  slowing."
" If the tension between the progress on employment and the lack of progress on inflation persists, it may lead me to  reassess the expected path of the federal funds rate in the future, although it is premature to make that call today."
 Different Signals from the Labor Market and Inflation  Let me start by reviewing the conflicting  readings we are getting from the labor market and from inflation.
"Payroll growth has averaged 175,000 over the past three months, more than sufficient to absorb new entrants into the labor market."
"  Although e arlier in the recovery, it appeared that the U -3 unemployment rate was running ahead of broader indicators of slack, m ore recently, it has been encouraging to see other margins o f slack being drawn down."
" The labor  force participation rate has held stable, against what many believe to be a downward trend based on demographics, and the employment -topopulation ratio has reached a new post -recession high."
  The most commonly used U -3 measure of the unemployment rate moved down to  4.4 percent  in April.
"T his happens to be the cyclical low reached in 200607, although unemployment was at or below this leve l much of the time from the middle of 1998 to the middle of 2001."
" Relative to recent decades, the unemployment rate is now quite low."
" In fact, some have voiced concerns that the economy has proven unable to sustain its expansion when the unemployment rat e has fallen below these levels."
" Although rising inflation  often heralded the death knell of economic expansions in earlier  decades , inflation expectations ha ve been well anchored and rising inflation has presented less of a risk  in the most  recent business cycle s.2  From 1998 to 2001, for instance, core personal consumption expenditures ( PCE) inflation ne ver exceeded 2  percent on a four -quarter basis."
" Core PCE                                                  2 In the period from 1950 to 2000, inflation often rose late in the busines s cycle."
" In response, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates, which in turn led to a weaker economy."
"  - 3 - inflation did reach as high as 2.4 percent in the period from 2006 to 2007, but, at the time, this higher inflation was viewed as reflecting the pass -through of a significant runup in energy  and no nenergy import prices .3 Today, there is little indication of an outbreak of inflation--rather, the latest data on inflation have been lower than expected."
" If anything , the puzzle today is why inflation appears to be slowing at a time when most forecasters place the economy at or near full employment."
"  Even w age inflation, which is most  tightly connected to labor market slack, shows little sign of heating up  by most mea sures ."
" Similarly, the employment cost index was up only 21/4 percent in the 12 months through March."
" The Atlanta Fed’s Wage Growth Tracker tells a similar story:  Upward movement in wage gains was observed until about a year or so ago, but there has been little acceleration recently."
"  Turning to overall inflation, e arlier this year, reports indicated  that the Federal Open Market Committee’s ( FOMC ) preferred measure of inflation --the headline measure of consumer price inflation on a national accounts basis --had , on a 12 -month change basis,  risen  close to the FOMC’s objective , but t he latest figures   have edged down somewhat  as the rebound in e nergy prices has abated ."
" I tend to place greater weight on                                                  3 For example, t he FOMC minutes for March 2007 expressed “concern” about the rate of inflation  but noted that increases in energy and non -energy imports could explain some of the upward pressure on core prices (see Board of Governors, 2007, paragraph 23)."
 The outlook was for a gradual decline in core inflation.
"  - 4 - the core measure of inflation , which abstract s from the transitory movements in energy prices and is a  better predictor of future inflation."
 And  there does  not seem to have been any progress over the past year or so:  Core  PCE inflation is about the same over the past 12 months as over the preceding period.
"  Although the p ast two monthly readings of core inflation have been held down in part  by idiosyncratic factors, including upgrades to cell -phone plans , the apparent lack  of progress in moving core inflation back to 2 percent is a source of concern."
" Traditionally, economists assessed that as labor market slack diminished and the economy approached full employment, upward pressure on inflation would result, in the statistic al relationship known as the Phillips curve."
 But I am not confident we can count on the Phillips curve to restore inflation to target in today’s economy.
" Since 2012, inflation has tended to change relatively little --both absolutely and relative to earlie r decades --as the unemployment rate has fallen considerably.4  At a time when the unemployment rate has fallen from 8.2 percent to 4.4 percent, core inflation has undershot our 2 percent target for 58 straight months.5  In other words, the Phillips curve appears to be flatter today than it was previously."
" This is also true in a number of advanced foreign economies, where declines in unemployment rates to low levels have failed to generate significant upward pressures on inflation ."
" Similarly, inflation did n ot fall very much as the unemployment rate climbed to 10 percent during the Great Recession."
 5 The inflation information refers to core PCE inflation measured on a 12 -month average basis.
"  - 5 - With the Phillips curve a ppearing to be a less reliable guidepost than it has been in the past, the anchoring role of inflation expectations remains critically important."
" The May reading of the Univers ity of Michigan  Survey s of Consumers’ mea sure of longer -term inflation expectations remain ed near  its alltime low,  while  the New York Fed’s measure of threeyear inflation expectations edged up in its latest reading to the highest level in more than a year."
"  And although market -based measures of  inflation compensation have improved relative to their lows in the middle of last year , they are still below the average level in the period from 2010 to 2014."
"  Attaining the Committee’s symmetric target for inflation on a sustainable basis is especially  important in the current environment , with the neutral real interest rate at historically lower levels , in order to ensure conventional policy has room to respond to unexpected adverse developments."
" U nderlying fundamentals, such as import prices and diminishing slack, should lead inflation to resume moving closer to its goal ."
"Nonetheless , currently I see more signs that progress on inflation is slow ing than  of a breakout of inflation to the upside, as might be the case with a nonlinearity in the relationship between inflation and unemployment  when unemployment is very low .6   But as noted earlier , a breakout in inflation also was not a primary concern following  the past  two times the unemployment rate dropped as low as it is now, in 1998 and 2006, when recessions followed within two or three years."
   It is also possible that the  natural rate of unemployment has moved lower or that the unemployment rate still may be overstating the strength of the labor market.
" And   - 7 - another key measure --the prime -age employment -topopulation ratio--remains more than  1 percentage point below pre -crisis levels, and further improvement there would be welcome."
" The O utlook  Looking at economic activity more broadly, although first -quarter gross domestic product ( GDP ) was soft , the data so far suggest a rebound in the second quarter ."
" Moreover, below the  topline number, there were some encouraging signs of strength:  Residential construction posted a double -digit increase and contributed 1/2 percentage point to first -quarter GDP growth."
" Drilling for oil and natural gas is rebounding sharply, and nonresi dential construction contributed 3/4 percent age point  to first -quarter GDP growth."
" Household incomes should continue rising with the continued strengthening in employment and wages, home prices should be contributing through improved household balance sheets, and consumer sentiment remains upbeat."
" After moving up sharply late last year, long -term interest rates have moved down somewhat so far this year."
" In particular, the latest international economic data have suggested waning downside risks from abroad, while continued labor market strength and the prospect for fiscal stimulus in the United States present a possible upside risk to domestic demand."
"  Importantly, we are seeing synchronized global growth for the first time in many years."
" Growth forecasts for both advanced and emerging  market economies are being marked up, breaking a pattern of r epeated downward revisions from 2013 to 2016."
" Recent political developments significantly enhanced the prospects for policy continuity in the euro area, and there has been continued growth in euroarea employment and economic activity ."
" China’s first -quarter growth came in above  7 percent at an annual rate, although there appears to ha ve been some moderat ion since  then, and capital outflows slowed notably."
" Although Mexico’s growth may moderate  this year, both the Mexican equity market and the exchange rate have strengthened , along with confidence, following sharp falls late last year."
"   Along with the favorable shift in foreign risks, recent announcements on fiscal policy suggest some upside risk to U.S. aggregate demand."
" Most estimates suggest that the supply -side effects of these  policies would be fairly small, s o, if enacted, the net effect could well be a boost to U.S. aggregate demand at a time when the economy could be at  full employment."
"The Path of Policy  On balance, when assessing economic activity and its likely evolution, it would be reasonable to conclude that further removal of accommodation will likely be appropriate soon."
" As I noted earlier, the unemployment rate is now at 4.4 percent, and we are seeing improvement in other measures of labor  market slack, such as  participation and  the share of those working part time for economic reasons."
 There are good reasons to believe that the improvement in real economic activity will continue:  Financial conditions remain supportive.
" T he balance of risks at home has shifted favorably, downside risks from abroad are lower than they have been in several years, and we are seeing synchronous global growth."
" In my view, that “well under way” standard has served an important purpose.8  With asymmetry in the scope for conventional monetary policy to respond to shocks, maintaining reinvestments provided an important benefit by  enabling the federal funds rate to rise more quickly than would have be en possible with a shrinking balance sheet and sooner reach a level that allows for reductions if conditions deteriorate."
"As we shrink the size of our balance sheet, the public’s holdings of Treasury securities will rise, and that will tend to boost longer -term interest rates."
" In particular, most studies conclude that increases in central bank holdings of longer -maturity assets chiefly affect interest rates by reducing the quantity of longer -term securi ties held by the public and putting downward pressure on the term premium --that is, the difference                                                  7 See Brainard (2017)."
 - 11 - between the yields on longer -dated assets and the path of expected short -term interest rates over the holding period.
" Most studies find that higher Trea sury yields also affect yields and prices of other securities :  increasing interest rates faced by privatesector borrowers , mak ing dollar -denominated assets more attractive, which tend s to boost the exchange value of the dollar , and mak ing fixed -income assets more attractive relative to stocks, tending to depress share prices."
" Together,  these channels contribute to a tightening in financial conditions .10 These effects are, of course, in many respects, similar to the effects of increases in short -term interest rates."
" As a result , the FOMC will be in the unfamiliar posture of having two tools available for adjusting monetary policy ."
"11 There may be differences in the specific ways changes in short -term rates and the balance sheet transmit to different asset prices and the exchange rate, although estimates are limited and lack precision."
"  Under the subordinated balance sheet  approach, once the change in reinvestment policy is triggered, the balance sheet would essentially be set on a utopilot to shrink passively until it reaches a neutral level , expanding in line with the demand for currency thereafter."
"The Committee’s policy normalization  principles have made clear that the Federal Reserve  “will, in the longer run, hold no more securities than necessary to implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively .”12  Over time, the gradual reduction in our balance sheet should result in a gradual decline in reserves to a longer -run level that is well below today’s level but lik ely somewhat higher than in the pre -crisis regime."
 That minimum level will depend on the structural demand for reserves and the short -term variability in the d emand for and supply of reserves.
" With the labor market continuing to strengthen, and GDP growth  expected to rebound in the second quarter, it likely will be appropriate  soon to adjust the federal funds rate ."
" I support an approach that retains the federal funds rate as the primary tool for adjusting monetary policy , sets the balance sheet to shrink in a gra dual and predictable way for both Treasur y securities  and MBS , and avoids spikes in redemptions."
" While that remains my baseline expectation, I will be watching carefully for any signs that progress toward our inflation objective is  slowing ."
" With a low ne utral real rate, achieving our symmetric inflation target is more important than ever in order to preserve  - 14 - some room for conventional policy to buffer adverse developments in the economy."
" If the soft inflation data persist, that would be concerning and, ultimately , could  lead me to reassess the appropriate path of  policy."
