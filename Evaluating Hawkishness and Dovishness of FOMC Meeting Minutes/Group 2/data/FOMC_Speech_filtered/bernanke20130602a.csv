" Please note, these points have nothing whatsoever to do with interest rates."
" As the Gospel of Luke says (and I am sure my rabbi will forgive me for quoting the New Testament in  a good cause):  “From everyone to whom much has been given, much will be required; and from the one to whom much has been entrusted, even more will be demanded” ( Luke 12:48, New Revised Standard Version Bible )."
