"For release on delivery  8:00 p.m. E ST (5:00 p.m. local time ) December 1 , 2015         Normal izing  Monetary Policy When the Neutral Interest Rate I s Low     Remarks by   Lael Brainard   Member   Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at  Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research   Stanford, California         December 1 , 2015    Let me begin  by noting that m y comments today will not address the timing of liftoff  for the federal funds rate.1 Recent months have seen increased  anticipation of the normalization of monetary policy in the United States."
" Many observers  interpret  normal ization to mean a tightening cycle similar in pace to previous cycles, such as those from 1994 to  1995 and from 2004 to 2007, with the effect of returning interest rates to the level viewed as normal in the decades before the crisis ."
 The Federal Reserve describ es normalization as  “steps to raise the federal funds rate and other shor tterm interest rates to more normal levels.”2  But what do we mean by “ more  normal  levels ”?
" A broad deterioration in foreign growth prospects, together with gre ater risk sensitivity in the wake of the crisis  and changes in the rate of potential output gr owth, may be contributing to a “ new normal."
"”  The new normal is likely to be characterized by a low er level of interest rates than in the decades preceding the crisis , which counsels a cautious and gradual approach to adjusting monetary policy."
 The Benchm ark Neutral Rate  The appropriate pace and target for normalizing monetary policy depend centrally on understanding the neutral rate of interest .
 The nominal neutral  interest rate is the level of the federal funds rate  that is consistent with output growing close to its potential rate with full employment and stable inflation .3  The appropriate  benchmark for assessing the stance of monetary policy is the gap between the policy rate and the nominal  neutral rate                                                  I am grateful to Jim Clouse and Andrew Figura for their assistance in preparing this text.
 3 The closely related concept of the natural rate of interest-- the rate of interest at which investment and savings are equilibrated at full employment --is originally attributed to Swedish economist Knut Wicksell.
" For this reason, many monetary policy rules, such as the well -known Taylor rule, incorporate an estimate of  the neutral  real interest rate  as a critical parameter along with  the target rate of inflation.4 Although the neutral rate is a critical benchmark for monetary policy, it changes over time in response to important  changes in economic con ditions , necessitating corresp onding adjustments in monetary policy in order to restore the economy to full employment."
" For instance, when there are modest adverse shocks to demand that lead to modest reductions in the shorter -run neutral rate, monetary policy can provide enough support t o keep the economy at full employment  simply by reducing the policy rate commensurate with the decline in the nominal neutral rate ."
" However, when  the adverse shocks  to demand are sufficiently  severe to push the nominal neutral interest rate substantia lly below zero , as they were during the Great Recession, monetary policy confronts the zerolower -bound constraint, at which point the federal funds rate cannot fall low enough to provide the necessary degree of accommodation without becoming negative ."
" That is why  monetary policymakers  in the United States and several other major economies have been compelled to use  additional  unconventional  tools to promote  full employment and target inflation, such as forward  guidance and asset purchases."
"  - 3 - The neutral rate of interest is not directly observable, but we can back out an estimate of the neutral rate by relying on the observation that output should grow faster relative to potential growth the lower the federal funds rate is relative to the nomin al neutral rate."
" In today’s circumstances, t he fact that the  U.S.  economy is growing at a pace only modestly above potential  while core inflation remains restrained  suggests that the nominal neutral rate may not be far above the nominal federal funds rate , even now ."
" To answer this question, it is helpful to us e economic forecasts , market -implied expectations, and econometric models  to assess where real interest rates  are expected to be in the longer run, and compare them with the levels that prevailed in the decades before the crisis."
" In doi ng so, it is important to abstract from shocks that are transitory or cyclical and thus likely to fade away over a year or two.6 Starting with economic forecasts, Blue Chip Forecasts publishes projections of the federal funds rate and c onsumer price i ndex (CPI) inflation 6 to 10 years into the future , when the economy is typically expected to be near full employment."
" Using a similar measure , in the United States,  the 11 -year moving average of the short -term real interest rate is now at its lowes t level since the beginning of  the series in the late 1950s."
" For example, we  can back out an implied 1 -year real rate 10 years from now  from the Treasury inflation -protected securities , or TIPS , yield curve."
                                                  7 Here the longer -run real rate is defined as the consensus longer -run nominal federal funds rate minus the consensus longer -run rate of CPI  inflation.
" Because most forecasts of economic conditions far into the future are predicated on the economy being at full employment, forecasts of relatively low actual real rates are consistent with forecasts of relatively low neutral rates."
" 8 In the SEP , longer -run projections represent each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy."
" There are a host of factors that could lead  the neutral rate to remain depressed in the longer run--ranging from the low level of  world real interest rates , which affects the United States  via the exchange rate and financial mark et channels , to slow -moving secular trends in the labor force and productivity, to persistent changes in risk perceptions stemming from the crisis."
" In addition to concerns about weak  demand in Japan and  the euro area, more recently  foreign growth concerns have  broadened to include China, which is navigating difficult structural as well as cyclical adjustments."
" The financial reverberations from China are adversely affect ing commodity exporters and                                                  9 Laubach and Williams define the natur al rate as “the real short -term interest rate consistent with the economy operating at its full potential once transitory shocks to aggregate supply or demand have abated” (2015, p."
" - 6 - emerging markets more br oadly, and w eak growth trajectories are now  the norm in much of the world, pushing down interest rates globally."
"  The broadbased reduction in interest rates in the rest of the world, by increasing demand for U.S. assets, puts  upward pressure on the dolla r, which in turn implies  downward pressure on the U.S. neutral rate."
 One way to think about the spillover from abroad is how much adjustment in the federal funds rate might be necessary to insulate domestic employment from an appreciation in the dollar that is expected to persis t.
" According to the Board’s FRB/US model, it would require lowering the path of the federal funds rate by roughly 1 percentage point over the medium term  to insulat e domestic employment from the  15 percent stronger exchange rate in inflation adjusted terms ."
"Going forward, many observers expect global growth to stabilize and eventually move higher , easing pressure on the dollar and on commodity prices and leading to a higher neutral interest rate globally .10  However, as foreign economies face structural as well as cyclical adjustments , the speed at which the stabilization and recovery of foreign growth takes place is highly uncertain, and there is a risk that this influence on the neutral rate could fade very slowly."
" Importantly, expectations that the economy’s growth potential has fallen could contribute to a  persistent decline in the neutral rate."
" Indeed , there is evidence that growth in the labor force, and perhaps productivity, have slowed persis tently in recent years."
" Most  recently, the pace of decline has quickened, with the participation rate declining 1/2 percent per year, on average, over the recovery.11  Productivity growth has also slowed, averaging just 1 percent per year over the recovery , about half the pace over the 50 years prior to the financial crisis .12  Given this data, the Congressional Budget Office now estimates that the growth rate of potential output is only 1.7 percent currently, less than half the rate during the 50 years before 2008."
" Nevertheless, although there is evidence of a connection between low potential output growth and a low neutral rate, as pointed out by Hamilton and others , the relationship is not precisely estimated , which leaves  considerabl e uncertainty about the  magn itude of the  effect .13 Finally, investors’ risk sensitivity appears to have been altered  by the experience of tail risks during the crisis, which could have a persistent depressing effect on the                                                  11 Population growth has also moved gradually lower in the United States, though the effect has not been as large as in some foreign economies, where the size of the population is now stagnant or falling."
  12 It is unclear how persistent recent low rates of measured productivity growth will be.
" While weak investment levels, particularly early on in the recovery, likely contributed to lower productivity gains, investment levels going forward could  be closer to historical norms."
" Also, recent technological gains may eventually contribute strongly to productivity growth; see, for example, Baily, Manyika, and Gupta (2013) ."
" In addition,  there is evidence that some of the contribution of technology gains to productivity growth is being understated ; see, for exa mple, Byrne and Pinto (2015), Byrne and Corrado (2015), and Byrne, Oliner and Sichel (2015)."
" For example, according to d ynamic s tochastic general e quilibrium models estimated by the Federal Reserve Board  and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the natural rate of interest has been held down during the recovery by shocks that increase the difference between the marginal product of capital and the risk free rate, pushing down investment and reducing the level of capital.14  In addition, a simple measure of the marginal product of capital suggests that the return to capi tal investment has not changed very much, or perhaps  has even  increased, over the past decade despite the decline in risk  free rates.15 Implications for the Path of Monetary Policy  Before addressing what a persistently low neutral interest rate might mean for the normalization of monetary policy, it is helpful to review inflation developments."
" Because the federal funds rate is the real rate pl us the expected rate of inflation  and be cause it is the real rate that influences economic activity , the amount of monetary accommodation represented by a given nominal  level of the federal funds  rate decreases as expected inflation declines."
" In these models , the natural rate of interest is defined as the “rate of interest that would obtain if all prices and wages had adjusted so as to bring the level of economic activity to its full -employment rate."
"  - 9 - against extended periods of below -target inflation, which may lead inflation expectations to drift lower."
  It is thus notable that inflation has been below  our 2 percent target for  3 years.
"  Current  below -target levels of  inflation in p art reflect disinflationary pressures from abroad, including lower import prices and lower  commodity prices, which are likely to  fade over time."
" However, inflation has been stubbornly low, even excluding energy prices."
 Th e persisten t weakness in core price inflation deserves  continued vigilance .
" In determin ing the outlook for inflation, the gravitational force of long -term inflation expectations is especially important."
 S ome survey measures of inflation expectations  have  declined recently .
" For example, the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumer s median measure of inflation expectations at a 5to-10 year horizon was 2.6 percent in November and has averaged 2.7 percent over the past year, slightly below the average reading over the past decade of 2.9 percent."
" P rojections from the Survey of Professional Forecasters  also suggest that 10year-ahead inflation expectatio ns edged lower this quarter, although they have remained at or very near 2 percent since the end of 2012."
"  Market -based measures of inflation compensation  at longer -term horizons, such as inflation swaps and the difference between nominal and inflationindexed Treasury bond yields, have declined more  noticeably over the past year and a half."
" Although it is  - 10 - difficult to precisely disentangle the contribution of changes in inflation expectations , liquidity premiums , and inflation risk premiums  to this downward shift, some decompositions suggest that, while expected inflation may not have declined much, market participants may be placing a somewhat greater likelihood than previously on episodes of below -potential growth being accompanied by below -target inflation ."
" Thus, the decline in  measures of inflation expectations warrant s close monitoring."
"  The slow prog ress on inflation, together  with the likely low level of the longer -term neutral real rate and the slow pace at which the very low shorter -term rate may move to the longe rterm rate , suggest that the federal funds rate  is likely to  adjust  more gradual ly and to a lower level  than in previous expansions."
"  In addition, the combination of a low neutral real rate with slow progress on inflation suggests  a greater likelihood  of hit ting the zero lower b ound than in previous decades , when the neutral rate was probably much higher."
" The lower the longer -term nominal neutral rate is , the smaller in magnitude an adverse economic shock must be to push growth sufficiently below pot ential to necessitate a nominal federal funds rate below zero to provide accommodation."
" Because we have more space to respond by raising rates if inflationary for ces accelerate than by cutting rates if disinflationary forces emerge, when nominal neutral rates are likely to be lower on average, we s hould be cautious about r aising rates , do so gradually , and carefull y assess the effect s on economic and financial conditions as we go."
" If the actual neutral rate is higher than estimated , and policy is more accommodative than intended, the stance of policy can be readily tightened later to restrain any buildup in inflationary pressures."
"  - 12 - stance of monetary policy is tighter than intended, unexpected policy restraint may prove difficult to offset later with more accommodative policy because the policy rate is already close to the zero lower bound."
"Finally,  there is a risk that with  persistently low er neutral rates, there may be greater pressures for investors to reach for yield, increas ing the demand for risky assets."
"  Conclusion  A variety of evidence suggests that the longer -run neutral rate is lower now t han it has been historically , and that the very low shorter -run neutral rate may adjust to it very slowly , due to a combination of weaker foreign demand growth, gr eater risk sensitivity as a result of the crisis, higher risk premiums for productive investment , and lower growth in potential output."
" It also implies that the likelihood of the  federal funds rate hitting  the zero lower bound will be persistently  - 13 - greater than it has been previously , which could make it more difficult to achieve our objectives of full employment and 2 percent inflation."
" With the nominal neutral  interest rate lower than in the past , and  with  policy options being  more limited if conditions deteriorate than if inflationary pr essures  accelerate,  the asymmetry in  riskmanagement considerations counsel s a cautious and gradual approach ."
