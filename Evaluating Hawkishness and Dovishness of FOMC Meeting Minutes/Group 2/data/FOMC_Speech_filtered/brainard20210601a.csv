"For release on delivery  2:00 p.m. EDT  June 1, 2021         Remaining Steady as the Economy Reopens     Remarks by   Lael Brainard   Member   Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at  The Economic Club of New York   New York, New York  (via webcast)         June 1, 2021   It is a pleasure to join the Economic Club of New York for this discussion .1  Consumer demand is strong, vaccin e coverage  is expanding, and  pandemic -affected sectors are reopening in fits and starts ."
" As was the pandemic shutdown with its ebbs and flows, t he reopening is without prec edent, and it is generating supply–demand mismatches at the sectoral level  that are temporary in nature."
  The supply–demand mismatches at the sectoral level are making it difficult to precisely assess inflationary developments  and the amount of resource slack from month to month.
 The best way to achieve our maximum -employment and ave rageinflation goals is to be  steady  and transparent  in our  outcome -based  approach to monetary policy while remaining attentive to the evolution of the data and prepared to adjust as needed .
  Pent -Up Demand  and Supply Constraints  Last week’s updated estimate of first -quarter real gross domestic product continued to show strong annualized growth of 6.4 percent.
 I expect a further acceleration in output growth driven by consumer demand during the current quarter as the reopening of t he economy broadens.2    1 I am grateful to Kurt Lewis of the Federal Reserve Board for his assistance in preparing this text.
" 2 For example, the median f orecast for annualized real gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the second quarter is 7.9 percent in the most recent Survey of Professional Forecasters; see Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia (2021), Second Quarter 2021 Survey of Professional Forecast ers (Philadelphia:  Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, May), https://www.philadelphiafed.org/surveys -anddata/real -timedata-research/spf -q22021 ."
" The most recent estimate of annualized second -quarter real GDP growth from the GDPNow model at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta was 9.3 percent; see https://www.atlantafed.org/cqer/research/gdp now (accessed May 28, 2021)."
"  - 2 - Looking through the m onthto-month variation , the data  suggest  that very strong underlying spending growth is continuing this  quarter, fueled by recent  fiscal support  and continued reopening."
" Spending growth is strong in the pandemic -affected  services sectors that are reopening, with spending at restaurants and bars increasing 3 percent in April after surging 13 .5 percent in March."
 Growth this year is expected to be  the strongest in decades as the economy bounces back from the depressed level  associated with the pandemic .
" So an important  question is how much household spending will continue to support  growth into next year as opposed to settling back to pre -pandemi c trends , which would be an additional headwind relative to  the strong makeup consumption we have seen so far this year ."
"During the current reopening phase, t he surge in demand is hitting some sectors before the supply side has had a chance to catch up ."
" Importantly, the reopening pains associated with mismatches between demand and supply  in most sectors  are temporary in nature  and are likely to be resolved as pent -up demand moderates and businesses hire and expand."
 These temporary reopening mismatches are evident in recent data on both the employment and inflation sides of our mandate.
  Supply –Demand Mismatches in Inflation  The reopening dynamics are  evident in  the April inflation readings .
" I ha d been anticipating a  notable  move up in  inflation beginning in April  and lasting several months due to a combination of base effects and temporary reopening supply and demand  3 See Wendy Edelberg and Louise Sheiner (2021), “The Macroeconomic Implications of Biden’s $1.9 Trillion Fiscal Package,” Brookings Institute, Up Front  (blog), https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up -front/2021/01/28/the -macroeconomic -implications -ofbidens -19-trillion -fiscal -package ."
"  - 4 - mismatches.4  Core PCE inflation moved up to 3.1  percent on a 12 -month basis  in April , while 12month total PCE inflation ro se to 3.6 percent amid high energy prices."
  Core PCE inflation is estimated to be 2.4 percent  in April after adjusting for base effects .
" Apart from base effects, the underlying factors  driving the  increase  in inflation  are consistent  with my expectation s that we would s ee temporary price increases associated with  sectoral  supply–demand imbalances , and that the timing and sectoral incidence of these increases would be difficult to  predict ."
" While  the level of inflation  in my near -term outlook has moved somewhat  higher , my expectation for the contour of  inflation moving back towards its underlying trend in the period beyond the reopening  rema ins broadly unchanged."
" Used vehicles, airfares, and accommodations toget her contributed nearly one -third of month -overmonth core PCE inflation in April even though the cumulative weight of all three component s in the core  PCE basket is only  3 percent."
 T he major contributors to the April core PCE inflation increase are not si gnificant drivers of core inflation historically.
" On the demand side, stimulus payments and low borrowing rates have given households additional capabil ity to purchase vehicles , and the pandemic appears to have increased the  relative value of private transportation ."
"  Similarly, the travel -related accommodations and airfare sectors also contributed nearly 0.1 percentage point  to month -overmonth core PCE inflation."
" Prices are expected to continue to rise amid renewed summer travel, but the natural limitations to mak ing up spending on foregone travel are likely to result in a normalization of demand  growth after a few quarters , and the capacity  in these sectors will likewise increase from  their depressed pandemic levels as hiring proceeds ."
"  In assessing the risk that such transitory pricing pressures get embedded in persistently high inflation , it is critical to rememb er that inflation averaged less than 2 percent over the past quarter -century, and that statistical measures of trend inflation ran   - 6 - consistently below 2 percent for decades before  the pandemic.5  Relative to the entrenched inflation dynamic s that existed b efore the pandemic, the sharp  temporary  increases in some  categories of goods and services seem unlikely to leave an imprint on longer -run inflation behavior."
"  To be sure, I  will keep a close watch  on a range of  indicators for any signs of an unwelcome ch ange in longer -term inflation expectations ."
 The  measure of breakeven inflation compensation  based on Treasury InflationProtected Securities (TIPS)  suggests that the recent inflation data ha ve not disturbed longer -run inflation expectations.
" Indeed, since the April consumer price index data were released, TIPS -based breakeven inflation compensation for the next five years, as well as those for the five -year, five -yearforward , have moved down, not up."
" T he TIPS measures  suggest  that market participants are demanding less compensation for expected  longer -term inflation than they were before the April inflation data were released , rather than more ."
  Surveybased measures of inflation expectations  are mixed.
" The most recent Survey of Profession al Forecasters showed an increase in median  PCE  inflation expectations over the next five  years from 2 percent to 2.2 percent, and a small er increase for inflation expectatio ns over the next 10 years, from 2 percent  to 2.1 percent.6  Similar to the marketbased measures,  this survey measure  implies a slight decline in the forward  5 Monthly 12 -month total PCE inflation averaged 1.8 percent over the 25 years ending in April 2021."
 Statistical models estimate that underlying core PCE inflation range d from 0.1 to 0.4  percentage point below the 2 percent longer -run targe t in the period just before the pandemic .

  - 7 - inflation measure used to proxy for longer -term inflation expectations  relative to mediumterm expectations .
" In contrast , the median respon se in May  to the University of Michigan Survey of Consumers regarding inflation over the next 5 to 10 years moved up to a level last reached in 201 3.7  The Board staff ’s Index of Common Inflation Expectations, which combines the most recent signals from both market - and survey -based indicators, edged up a few basis points , reaching the bottom end of its range of values before the 2014 decline.8   The inflation dynamics seen over  the past few decades have led to inflation that is somewhat be low target and relatively stable."
 Inflation dynamics have generally evolved very gradually.
" Longer -term inflation expectations have been well  anchored, so when some developments have pushed inflation above or below target, the rise has not been  embedded in the ongoing inflation rate ."
Supply –Demand Mismatches in Employment A temporary mismatch between the  surge in demand and a  fitful supply response  at the sectoral level  is also evident in recent employment data.
" In part, the weak payrolls reflected some sectors where supply chain disruptions are limiting production despite strong demand."
" 8 For more information about the Index of Common Inflation Expectations, see Hie Joo  Ahn and Chad Fulton (2020) , “Index of Common Inflation Expectations ,” FEDS Notes (Washington:  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, September 2 ), https://doi.org/10.17016/2380 -7172.2551 ."
" - 8 - U.S. auto plants.9  These plant closings were evident in a decline of 27,000 jobs in the manufacturing of motor vehicles and parts in April, more than accounting for the 18,000 decline in manufacturing employment overall."
" Similarly, employment in construction was flat in April after increasing notably in March, as single -family housing starts dropped 13 percent over the month amid shortages of lumber that constrained contractors’ activity .10    The lackluster 218,000 increase in private payrolls in April also reflects post -pandemic sectoral reallocation."
" Sectors that expanded employment substantially in response to COVID -related demand appear to be shedding jobs in preparation for a post -pandemic world, with delivery services jobs declining by 77,000 and grocery store jobs declining by 50,000."
"       With the most recent Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey data showing a record 8.1 million job openings at the end of March, it appe ars that labor supply is lagging behind labor demand in several sectors , in part reflecting ongoing concerns about the virus and caregiving responsibilities.11  At the time of the April survey, 2.8 million  9 According to media reports, a number of U.S. auto plants have been idled by the shortage of semiconductors."
  - 10 - There is some debate about whether the  supplement al funds provided by unemployment insurance (UI) benefits  are lead ing workers to stay on the sidelin es.15  The high level of employment gains in the lowest -wage sector and the reduction in continued claims seem inconsistent with  supplemental  UI benefits playing a large role in the April employment report .
" The largest employment gains in the otherwise te pid April employment report were in the low -wage leisure and hospitality sector, where UI replacement rates are among the highest."
" In addition, between the March and April reference weeks, continued UI claims, inclusive of Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation and Extended Benefits, fell by about 1.3 million—indicating that many workers returned to work despite previously receiving UI benefits."
" For all these reasons, the supply–demand mismatches in the labor market are likely to be temporary, and I expect to see further progress  on employment  in coming months."
" That said, today employment remains far from our goal ."
" Jobs are down by over  8 million  relative to the ir prepandemic level, and the shortfall is over 10 million jobs if we take into account the secular job growth that would have occurred over the past year  15 Research indicates that the additional income provided to the unemployed through the CARES Act likely had little labor -supplyinduced effect  on the unemployment rate in early to mid -2020 and likely only a small effect on the jobfindin g rate in early 2021."
" As of April , the overall prime -age employment -topopulation (EPOP) ratio is 76.9 percent, more than 3 percentage points below its pre -pandemic level ."
"  Policy  Although continued vigilance  is warranted , the inflation and employment data thus far appear to reflect a temporary misalignment of supply and demand that should fade over time as the demand surge normalizes,  reopening is completed, and supply adapts to the  post -pandemic new normal."
" Under our guidance, a djustments in the path of monetary policy are transparently tied to realized progress on our maximumemployment and 2 percent a verage -inflation goals."
 A nd it will be important to see sustained progress on inflation given the preceding multiple year trend  of inflat ion below 2 percent .
 I will carefully monitor inflation and indicators of inflation expectations for any signs that longer -term inflation expectations  are evolving in unwelcome ways.
" Should inflation move materially and persistently above 2 percent, we have the tools and e xperience to gently guide inflation back down to target, and no one should doubt our commitment to do so."
" In the previous monetary policy framework, the customary preemptive tightening based on the outlook to head off  - 12 - concerns about future high inflation likely curtailed critical employment opportunities for many Americans and embedded persistently below -target inflation."
" Th e entrenched pre -pandemic combination of low equilibrium interest rates, low underlying trend inflation, and a flat Phillips curve is likely to reassert itself after reopening is complete."
" T his type of environment creates asymmetric risks, since the lower  bound constraint means that policy can respond more readily when inflation surprises to the upside than to the downside."
 The best way to achieve and sustain our maximum -employment and average -inflation goals is by r emaining steady and clear in our approac h while also  being attentive to changing conditions.
