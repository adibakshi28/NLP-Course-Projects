"For release on delivery  12:15 p.m. EST  December 7, 2018         Assessing Financial Stability over the Cycle     Remarks by  Lael Brainard   Member   Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at the   Peterson Institute for International Economics   Washington, D.C.         December 7, 2018   Financial stability is integral to achieving the Federal Reserve’s objectives of full employment and price stability."
" Today employment is strong , inflation is around target, and incomes are growing.1 If we le arned anything from this e xperience, it is that we must be especially vigilant to safeguard the resilience of our financial system in good times when vulnerabilities may be building."
" While the most recent reading o n core personal consumption expenditures , or PCE, inflation ticked down, indicators of underlying trend inflation remain encouraging overall, providing lit tle signal of an outbreak of inflation to the upside, on the one hand, and reassurance that underlying trend inflation may be close to our target of 2 percent, on the other (figure 1) ."
"The economy has grown 3 percent over the past year, and there are good reasons to expect growth to remain solid next year, supported by the strong underlying momentum in domestic demand."
" Consumer spending looks to be robust going into the fourth quarter, and ongoing gains in income and employment provide positive  fundamental s."
" Sizable fiscal stimulus has provided an important boost to demand this year and will likely contribute somewhat further next year, given the usual lags in outla ys and in the effects of tax cuts on business and household spending."
 The global growth that provided a strong tailwind going into this  year has moderated.
 The earlier  strong growth in Europe and Japan appears to be  softening toward trend.
" Here at home,  the impetus to growth from fiscal policy is likely  to fade going into 2020."
" Financial  - 3 - condi tions are  still support ive of  growth by many measures  (figure 2) , but less so than last year ."
" Despite this, however, inflation remains muted overall."
" At 3.7 percent, the unemployment rate is at its lowest level in 49 years, and p ayrolls have been growing well above the pace that is  consistent with labor market stabilization."
" Historically, the few periods when resource utilization has been similarly tight have seen elevated risks of either accelerating inflation or financial imbalances."
 Our goal now is to sustain  the expansion by maintaining  the economy around full employment and inflation around target .
" - 4 - Assessing Vulnerabilities over the Cycle The last several times resource utilization approached levels similar to today, signs of overheating showed up in financial -sector imbalances rather than in accelerating inflation."
"  - 7 - Further down the credit quality ladder, there has been sizable growth in leveraged lending, accompanied by a notable deterioration in underwriting standards."
"Although banks have improved pipeline management over the past decade, riskmanagement pr actices may have weaken ed som ewhat  recently  in the face of strong investor demand."
 It goes without saying we must take all appropriate steps  to prevent another G reat F inancial Crisis from causing the greatest contraction in global economic activity since the Great Depression.
" This suggest s policy might  seek to moderate financial vulnerabilities when they are likely to  materially  exacerbate an economic downturn, leading to deeper declines in output and higher levels of unemployment ."
" Over -indebted business es may face payment strains when earnings fall unexpectedly , and they may respond by pull ing back on employment and investment ."
" The slowdown in activity lowers investor demand for risky assets,  thereby raising spreads and depressing valuations."
" This dynamic feeds on itself,                                                  8 For example, López -Salido, Stein , and Zakrajšek (2017) present empirical evidence linking corporate debt excesses to contracti ons in U.S. economic activity and review related research."
" In contrast, the first goal of the CCyB is to directly build resilience at large bank holding companies when there is an elevated risk of above -normal losses, which often follow periods of credit growth or rapid asset price appreciation."
 The CCyB is expected to  be reduced as credit growth slows in order to  support credit supply at times when it might otherwise contract.
" And countercyclical capital requirements build resilience, unlike monetary policy."
" A number of countries have raised their CCyB setting above zero, and we can learn from their experiences, which have generally been positive.13   Conclusion Our job now is to sustain  the expansion by maintaining the economy around full employment and inflation near target."
" At the same time, the appetite for risk among financial  market participants rose  notably over 2017 and much of 2018, and corporate borrowing has reached new heights amid rapid growth and deteriorating underwriting standards in riskier segment s, such as leveraged lending."
