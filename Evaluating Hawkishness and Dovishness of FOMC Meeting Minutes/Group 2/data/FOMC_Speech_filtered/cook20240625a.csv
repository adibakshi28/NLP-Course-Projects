"For release on delivery  12:00 p.m. EDT  June 25, 2024          Moving Toward Better Balance and Implications for Monetary Policy    Remarks by   Lisa D."
" It is a fitting time to be speaking again to the Economic Club of New York, because this month marks two years since my first Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC)  meeting.1  At that meeting, we kicked off a series of large interest -rate increases, all of which I supported, because I am fully committed to bringing inflation sustainably back to our 2 percent target."
" As I said when I joined the Board, I care about both sides of the dual mandate Congress gives us, maximum employment  and price stability."
" When inflation was well above target and the unemployment rate was historically low, we prioritized restoring price stability."
" Over the past year, inflation has slowed , and labor market tightness has eased, such that the risks to achiev ing our inflation and employment goals have moved toward better balance."
" Today, I will provide a progress report on disinflation, give you my outlook on the economy, and share  my views on how to ensure that monetary policy bring s inflation fully back to 2 percent over time while being attentive to the risk of a slowing labor market."
" Inflation  As the U.S. and global economy recovered from the pandemic, rebounding demand came up against still -constrained supply, and inflation rose to the highest  level  in many years ."
" In the past two years, 12 -month inflation in the PCE price index has fallen  from a peak above 7 percent  to 2.7 percent in April, and it likely moved a bit lower in May based on consumer and producer price data ."
" However, after rapid disinflation in the  1 The views expressed here are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee."
 My focus remains on making sure inflation is on a path to return sustainably to 2 percent.
" When excluding oftenvolatil e food and energy costs, 12month  inflation in core goods prices is down from 7.6 percent in early  2022 , returning to the trend of slightly negative inflation observed before the pandemic."
" The increased availability of computer chips and other material inputs led to a recovery in motor vehicle production and, along with restraint in aggregate demand, likely reduced supply–demand imbalances for durable goods , more generally."
" Inflation in services, a spending category that accounts for about  twothirds  of household budgets, has slowed significantly , though it remains noticeably above pre -pandemic rates."
" Specifically, h ousing services inflation has eased quite  gradually, as it takes time for the moderation of  increases  in market rent—what a landlord charges a new tenant —to show through to broader measures of shelter costs."
"  Outside of housing, 12month services inflation slowed  over the course of last year from above 5 percent to below 3.5 percent but  has stalled near that  rate this year."
" Some of the largest contributors to recent services inflation are imputed prices, including portfolio management fees that are affected by equity price increases."
  - 3 - Other components of services inflation that are more reflective of supply and demand conditions in the economy have continued to ease.
  I expect that t he longer -run disinflation trend will continue as interest rates weigh on demand.
 Two other important factors supporting this trend are well -anchored longterm inflation expectations and short -term infla tion expectations falling back to near pre -pandemic levels.
" My forecast is that three - and sixmonth inflation rates will continue to move lower on a bumpy path, as  consumers’ resistance to price increases is reflected in the inflation data."
" I expect 12month inflation will roughly move sideways for the rest of this year, with  monthly data likely similar to  the favorable readings during the second half of last year."
" Beyond that, I see inflation slowing more sharply next year, with  housingservices inflation declin ing to reflect the past slowing in rents on new leases, core goods inflation remaining  slightly negative, and inflation in core services excluding housing easing over time."
" Labor Market  Turning to the other side of our dual mandate, the labor market has largely returned to a better alignment  between supply and demand."
 Many indicators suggest the job market is roughly where it was before  the pandemic —tight but not overheated.
" The unemployment rate was a still -low 4  percent in May, but it has gradually risen over the  - 4 - past year  since touching a more  than half -century low of 3.4 percent in April 2023."
"Layoffs remain low, and payroll growth has been solid so far this year, adding an average of 248,000 jobs a month, essentially matching last year’s pace."
" With more workers entering the economy, the mont hly job gains needed to keep the unemployment rate steady likely has risen from just under 100,000 to nearly 200,000."
" Although these estimates are uncertain, such a breakeven pace may be  a bit higher than  the true pace of recent job gains, when taking into account data from the Quarterly Census for Employment and Wages ."
" For example, the ratio of job vacancies to unemployment has fallen from a high of 2.0 in mid -2022 to 1.2 in April, in line with its pre -pandemic level."
 Wage growth is outpacing inflation but is also moderating.
 Data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta show that the wagegrowth differential between job changers and st ayers has narrowed.
" Wage  - 5 - growth reflected in postings from online job boards, such as Indeed, has  returned to pre -pandemic levels."
"   Economic Activity  Turning to the broader picture, the U.S. economy has rebounded robustly since the short but deep pandemic recession."
" Overall , gross domestic product ( GDP ) growth eased in the first quarter from the rate at the end of last year."
" However, much of the firstquarter weakness was in net exports and inventories, noisy components from which I do not take much signal, while growth in private domestic final purchas es remained solid."
" Going forward, I expect economic growth to remain near  the rate of potential grow th, somewhat above 2 percent, which is boosted by the increase in the size of the labor force."
"American consumers have driven the current expansion, bolstered by strong income growth."
" But recent data , including first -quarter household spending and retail sales for April and May, suggest that growth is s lowing."
" If that strength continues, it has the potential to increase productivity over time."
 Productivity growth is one factor that could change the path of both the expansion and inflation.
" Last year’s GDP growth of 3.1 percent came alongside more moderate employment gains, implying strong growth in productivity."
 The economy may have benefited from investment undertaken in response to strong demand when the labor market was tight.
" Productivity growth is volatile and difficult to measure , but if it remains strong, then a faster pace of economic growth might not be inflationary."
" While the pace o f gains may have cooled from last year, I still lean toward optimism on innovation and productivity."
" Looking ahead, I see adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) technology as a potentially significant source of productivity growth, keeping in mind that breakthroughs, such as effective generative AI, will take time to fully reach their potential and disseminate throughout the economy and for complementary investment to bear fruit."
" Monetary Policy  Considering the full view of economic data available at the time, my colleagues on the FOMC and I decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5 -1/4 to 51/2 percent when we met earlier this month."
" I believe our current monetary policy stance is restrictive, putting downward pressure on aggregate demand in the economy."
" With disinflation continuing, albeit at a slower pace this year, and the labor market having largely normalized, I see the risks to achieving our employment and inflat ion goals as having moved toward better balance."
  - 7 - Returning inflation sustainably to our 2 percent target is an ongoing process and not a fait accompli.
 Many of these businesses also face short -duration loans that need to be refinanced at higher interest rates.
" Larger firms, like many homeowners, were able to lock in low interest rates for longer terms a few years ago, before rates rose."
 One scenario is the possibility that persistently high inflation durably increases inflation expectations.
" While this appears less likely than a year or two ago, I  am very attentive to the evolution of inflation expectations ."
 Such a  risk would imply keeping monetary policy restrictive for longer.
" In that case, monetary policy would need to respond to such a threat to the employment side of the dual mandate."
" With significant progress on inflation and the labor market cooling gradually, at some point it will be appropriate to redu ce the level of policy restriction to maintain a healthy balance in the economy."
 Borrowing by businesses and households has been expanding at rates below GDP growth for several years.
" A stable and resilient financial system is critical to the well -being of hous eholds and firms , allowing them to access credit, and it is essential for the Federal Reserve to achieve its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability."
