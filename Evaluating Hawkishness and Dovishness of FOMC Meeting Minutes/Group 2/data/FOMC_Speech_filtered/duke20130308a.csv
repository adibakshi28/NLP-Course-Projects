"  In national surveys, households report that low interest rates and house prices make it a good time to buy a home ; they also appear more certain that house price gains will continue.3  And real estate agents report stronger traffic of people shopping for homes.4 The open question is whether this positive trend is sustainable ."
" In particular, I expect demand to come from a pickup in new household formation, but I also recognize that these households may be the very population that faces especially tight credit conditions."
" Hous ing M arket O verview and O utlook  Last year’s house price gains were achieved in an environment largely defined by historically unusual factors:  a large number of underwater homeowners , whic h have effectively reduced the supply of properties  for sale ; the fact that foreclosed properties continue to represent an outsized, although gradually decreasing, share of sales transactions;  and strong demand on the part of  investors."
  This increase in investor demand has supported house prices  so far and may continue to provide a floor for them .
 I do not believe that a flood of houses on the market from households that are currently underwater or from bank REO is likely to materialize or to be sufficient to outpace growing demand.
" In that case, they would create additional demand as well as supply."
" For the housing recovery to gain true momentum, however, demand for housing among owner -occupier s must increase."
"  As I noted ear lier, household sentiment toward homebuying, as measured by households’ assessment s of purchasing conditions and by homebuyer traffic, appears to be on an upswing  and should gradually strengthen demand."
 But I expect  the strongest impetus to  recovery  to come from pent -up demand for housing in the form of household formation.
" - 6 - family members increased between 2006 and 201 0 by over 1 million more than would be expected by the demographic trend .9  In this downturn, the unemployment rate among younger adults rose by more than among the population as a whole."
  As the unemployment rate continues to decline --albeit likely at a slower  pace than any of us would like --household formation  and housing demand should increase .
" Whether this pattern stems from tight supply or from weak demand among borrowers with lower credit scores , it has disturbing implications for potential new households ."
" From late 2009 to late 2011, the fraction of individuals under 40 years of age getting a mortgage for the first time was about half of what it was in the early  2000s.10  The drop was especially pronounced for individuals with low credit scores  and remained large even after controlling for local unemployment rates and for measures of the  individual’s demand for credit --a result indicat ing that tight credit supply is an important factor."
 Many of these young individuals  have relatively weak credit rec ords and are more likely to have had  a recent spell of unemployment.
"  Although purchase originations have been subdued, refinancing originations, according to staff estimates, have responded to recor dlow interest rates by more than doubling from mid2011 to the end of 2012."
" When capacity constraints are binding, lenders may manage the surge in refinancing demand by holding mortgage rates  high relative to lenders’ funding costs."
"  Furthermore, when refinan cing demand is high, lenders  have less incentive to pursue harder -tocomplete or less profitable loan applications ."
" As more private capital returns to the mortgage market, though, two aspects of the QM rule will have a more significant effect on access to credit:   the debt -toincome ( DTI) requirement and the provisions that affect interest rates, points, and fees."
" For example, lenders might compensate for this risk by charging a higher interest rate on the loan."
" Very few of these higher -priced loans are being originated currently, reflecting the weak mortgage demand and tight underwriting standards that I discussed earlier ."
" However, as demand picks up and lending  standards ease, the number of                                                  11 Homeowner DTI is measured at  the time of the survey, not at the time of loan origination, and may understate the number of affected households if household finances improve after the purchase of a home."
" The “points and fees” definition has been expanded from its original definition in the Truth in Lending Act  and now includes, for example, compensation paid to the loan originator in the form of a higher interest rate on the loan ."
" As a result, the QM -related incentives against charging higher interest rates, points, or fees will likely affect more loans than in the past and may, in turn, have a greater effect on credit availability for higher -risk borrowers."
 The R ole of M onetary Policy  I would like to conclude with a brief discussion of the role of monetary policy in the housing recovery.
 The fact that mortgage purchase originations have remained near ly flat at a time when interest rates have hit historic lows naturally raises the question of whether monetary policy is effective in stimulating the housing market and thereby the broader economy.
 Monetary policy has clearly set the stage for a revival of the housing market.
 Record -low interest rates have sparked interest in homebuying.
 Monetary policy has contributed significantly to the recent improvement in the labor market and thereby begun to ease one of the main sources of weak housing demand.
" Monetary policy has  - 18 - likely also  supported investor demand for purchasing houses, as the expected return on an investment in housing is more likely to exceed the low yields available on Treasury securities and other debt instruments."
" The int erest -ratesensitive housing market is affected by all of the tools of monetary policy , but purchases of agency MBS  have a more direct effect on the mortgage market."
"  So, without delving deeply into monetary policy generally, I would like to make a few observations about the efficacy and costs of MBS purchases specifically."
" In many ways , purchases of MBS have the same downw ard effect on the general level of longterm interest rates as purchases of other longer -term securities ."
" Second, even with the recent positive signs, housing investment has contributed far less to economic growth than in a typical recovery."
" While low mortgage rates are helping support the recovery , I believe it will be the pent -up demand of household formation unleashed by improving economic conditions that will provide real momentum ."
