"Powell   Chair Pro Tempore   Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at  “Policy Options for Sustainable and Inclusive Growth”  38th Annual Economic Policy Conference  National Association for Business Economics   Washington, D.C.         March 21, 2022   Thank you for the opportunity to speak with you today."
" At the Federal Reserve, our monetary policy is guided by the dual mandate  to promote maximum e mployment and stable prices ."
" From th at standpoint , the current picture is plain to see:  The labor market  is very strong, and inflation is much too high."
" My colleagues and I are ac utely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship, especially o n those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation."
" There is an obvious need to move expedit iously to  return the stance of monetary policy to a more neutral level, and then to move to more restrictive levels if  that is what is required to restore price stability."
" In my comments today, I will first discuss the economic conditions that warran t these actions and then address th e path ahead for monetary policy."
"  - 2 -  The L abor Market I s Very  Strong and Extremely  Tight To begin with employment, in the last few years of the historically long expansion that ended with the arrival of the pandemic, we saw the remarkable benefits of an extended period of strong labor market conditions."
" Employment growth powered through the  difficul t Omicron wave, adding 1.75 million jobs over the past three months."
" The unemployment rate has fallen to 3.8 percent,  near historic al lows, and ha s reached this level much faster than anticipated by most forecasters (figure 1) ."
" While disparities in emplo yment remain, j ob growth has been widespread across racial, ethnic, and demographic  groups ."
" By many measures, the labor market is extremely tight , significantly tighter than the very strong job market  just before the pandemic ."
" There are far  more job openings  going unfilled  today than before  the pandemic , despite today’s  unemployment rate being higher."
"  It is worth considering why the  labor market is so tight,  given that the unemployment rate  is actually higher than it was before the pandemic ."
" One explanation is that the natural rate of unemployment may be  temporarily elevated, so wage pressure is greater  for a ny given level of unemployment."
"  Over time, we might expect these factors to fade, reducing pressure in the job market."
" Total demand for labor , measured by total employ ment plus posted job openings, has  substantially recovered  and far exceed s the size of the workforce ."
 Increases in l abor force participation  often  substantially lag declines in unemployment .
"  Overall, the labor market is strong but showing a clear imbalance of supply and demand."
" Our monetary policy tools cannot help with labor supply in the near term , but in a long expansion, the factors holding back supply wi ll likely ease ."
" In the meantime, we aim to use our tools to moderate demand growth, thereby facilitating continued, sustainable increases in employment and wages."
"     1 See the discussion of labor force participation in Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2022), Monetary Policy Report  (Washington:  Board of Governors, February),  https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/20220225_mprfullreport.pdf ."
" - 4 -  The I nflation O utlook Has Deteriorated S ignificantly  Turning to price stability, the inflation outlook had deteriorated sig nificantly this year even before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine."
" For example, at the time of our June 2021 meeting, every Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)  participant and all but one of 35 submissions in the Survey of Professional Forecasters predicted that 2021 inflation would be below 4 percent ."
" Inflation came in at 5.5 percent.2  For a time, moderate inflation forecast s looked plaus ible—the one -month headline and core inflation rate s declined steadily from April  through September ."
" But inflation moved up sharply in the fall, and , just since our December meeting , the median FOMC projection for year -end 2022 jumped from 2.6 percent to 4.3 percent."
" In my view, an important part of the explanation is that forecasters widely underestimat ed the severity and persistence of supplyside frictions , which, when combined with strong demand, especia lly for durable goods, produced surprisingly high inflation."
"   The pandemic  and the associated shutdown and reopening of the economy caused a serious upheaval in many parts  of the economy, snarling supply chains, constraining labor supply, and creating a major boom in demand for goods and a bust in s ervices demand."
 The combination of the surge in goods demand with  supply chain bottlenecks  2 This is headline personal consumption expenditures inflation on a Q4/Q4 basis.
" Prices soared  across the vehicles sector as b ooming demand was met by a sharp decline in global production during the summer of 2021, owing to shortages of computer chips ."
"   Many  forecasters, including FOMC participants , had been expecting inflation to cool in the second half of last year, as the economy started going back to normal after vaccines became widely  available.3  Expectations were that the supplyside damage would begin to heal."
"   The P olicy Response As the magnitude  and persistence of the increase in inflation  became increasingly clear  over the second half of last year , and as the job market recovery accelerated beyond  3 See the minutes  of the June 2021 FOMC meeting, which are available on the Board’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm ."
"  - 6 -  expectations , the FOMC pivoted to progressively less accommodative monetary policy."
 I believe that these policy actions and those to come will help bring inflation down near 2 percent over the next 3 years.
"   Thus, my main message today is  that, as the outlook evolves, we will adjust policy as needed in orde r to e nsure a return to price stability with a strong job market ."
 How will fallout from the invasion of Ukraine aff ect the economy and monetary policy?
" In addition to the direct effects from higher global oil and commodity prices, the invasion and related events are likely to restrain economic activity abroad and further disrupt supply chains, which would crea te spillovers to the U.S. economy."
" Today a rise in oil prices has mixed effects on the economy, lowering real household incomes and thus demand, but  raising  investment i n drilling over time and benefiting oil -producing areas more generally."
"  Second, how likely is it that monetary policy can lower i nflation without c ausing a recession?"
" In the  FOMC participant  projections  I just described, the economy achieves a soft landing, with inflation coming down and unemployment holding steady."
 Growth slows as the very fast growth from the early  4 I discussed this topic more fu lly in Jerome H.

" - 8 -  stages of reopening fades, the effects of fiscal support wane, and monetary policy accommodation is removed."
" I believe that the historical record provides some  grounds  for optimism :  Soft, or at least softish, landings have b een relatively common in U.S. monetary  history.5  In three episodes —in 1965, 1984, and 1994—the Fed raised the federal funds rate significantly  in response to perceived overheating without precipitating a recession (figure 6).6  In other cases, recessions chronologically followed the conclusion of a tightening cycle, but the recessions w ere not apparently due to excessive tightening  of monetary policy ."
" And monetary policy is often said to be a blunt instrument, not capable of surgical precision."
 It is worth noting that t oday t he economy is very strong and is well positioned to handle tighter monetary policy.

"      Our monetary policy framework, as embodied in our S tatement o n Longer -Run Goals and Monetary P olicy S trategy , emphasizes that having longer -term inflation expectations anchored at our longer -run objective of 2 percent helps us achieve both our dualmandate objectives."
" In the recent period, short -term inflation expectations have, of course, risen with inflation , but l onger -run expectations  remain well  anchored in their historical ranges (figure 7)."
"  The added near -term upward pressure from the  invasion of  Ukraine on inflation from energy, food, and other commodities comes at a time of already too high inflation ."
" In normal times, when employment and inflation are close to our objectives, monetary policy would look through a brief burst of inflat ion associated with commodity price shocks."
" However, the risk is rising that an extended period of high inflation could push longer -term expectations uncomfortably higher, which underscores the need for the Committee to move expeditiously as I have descri bed."
