"For release on delivery  5:30 a.m. E ST (11:30 a.m. local time )  November  12, 2019          Monetary Policy, Price Stability, and Equilibrium Bond Yields :   Success and C onsequences     Remarks by  Richard H."
 I am pleased that this year the focus of the conference is on two of my long -standing professional interests —financial markets and monetary policy.
" In particular, I would like to address an issue that has been much in focus —the decline in long -term interest rates —highlighting the role of monetary policy in contributing to that decline and the implications of that decline for the conduct of monetary policy."
 The Decline in Long -Term Interest Rates and the Role of Monetary Policy  One of the most remar kable and fundamental changes in  the global financial  landscape over the past three decades has been the steady and significant  decline in global sovereign  bond yields.
  - 2 - next 10 years  of the average level of short -term interest rates  plus a term premium.
 The term premium is the additional compensation —relative to investing in and rolling over short -maturity bills —that bondholders require for assuming the risk of holding a longduration asset  with greater exposure t o interest rate and inflation volatility.
" In this case, which is relevant today in the United States and some other countries,  the exposure to interest rate and infla tion volatility embedded in a long -maturity bond is more than offset by the potential value of the bond in hedging other risks, such as equity risk.2  The expectation of the average level of future short -term interest rates can, in turn, be decomposed into  the expectation of average future real interest rates and the expectation of average future inflation rates."
" Performing this standard  decomposition  reveals that the decline in long -term rates reflects declines in all three components:  expected real rates, expected inflation, and the term premium  (figure 2,  “Yield Decomposition”)."
" With respect to expected real short -term interest rates, one reason investors expect lower future short -term interest rates  is that neutral interest rates appear to have declined worldwide and are expected to remain low."
 This concept of a neutral level for short -term real interest rates is referred to in the academic literature as r* and corresponds to the rate consistent wit h a level of aggregate demand equal to and growing in pace with aggregate supply at an unchanged rate of inflation.
"  - 3 - Policymakers and academics alike, including myself, have spent co nsiderable time exploring  the reasons  for and ramifications of the decline in r*  across countries .3  For example, m any have pointed to slowing population growth and a moderation in the pace of technological change as consistent with a lower level of  r*.4  Changes in risk tolerance and regulations have led to an increase in savings and in the demand for safe assets, pushing down yields on  sovereign bonds.5  Importantly, economic theory suggests and empirical research confirms that there is a significant common global component embedded in individual country r*s ( figure  3, “Estimates of r* ”).6  This common factor driving individual country r*s not only reflects the influence of common global shocks affecting all economies in a similar way (for example, a slowdown in global productivity and the demographics associated with aging), but also results from international capital  flows that respond to and , over time , tend to narrow divergences in rates of return offered across different countries."
"   In addition to the decline in r*  around the world, lower longterm bond yields also reflect the influence of the initial downshift and ultimate anchoring of inflation expectations in many cou ntries after the mid -1990s."
" 5 See Williams (2 016, 2017);  Caballero , Farhi,  and Gourinchas  (2017) ; Glick (2019) ; Chen, Karabarbounis, and Neiman (2017); and Dao and Maggi (2018) for a discussion of the potential drivers for the increase in the supply of savings and increased demand for safe assets."
" Other factors cited for lower real rates include low productivity growth (Rachel and Summers , 2019) and secular stagnation due to insufficient aggregate demand (Summers , 2015)."
"  - 4 - primarily reflects fundamental “real” factors that are outside the control of a central bank, the decline and ultimate anchoring of inflation and inflation expectations in both major and many eme rging economies w ere the direct consequence of the widespread adoption and commitment to transparent, flexible inflation -targeting monetary policy strategies."
" But by t he mid -1980s , the back of inflation had been broken (thank you, Paul Volcker) , and total personal consumption expenditure (PCE) inflation  averaged less than 4 percent from 1985 to 1990."
" Following the 1990–91 recession, inflation fell  further , and, by the mid -1990s, the conditions for price stability in the United States had been achieved (thank you, Alan Greenspan)."
" From the mid -1990s until the Great Recession, U.S. PCE inflation averaged about 2 percent ."
" And , of course, t his step -down in inflation has been global, with the other major advanced economies experiencing a similar shift down  (table 1, “Average Inflation Rates”) ."
 Many  major emerging market economies as well have seen a remarkable and very welcome dec line in average inflation rates as a result of adopting and delivering on credible inflation -targeting polices.
" To the extent that the step -down in inflation is expected to persist, which appears to be the case, long -term yields have reflected this decline onefor-one."
"  However, n ot only has the average level of inflation fallen, but inflation has also become more stable."
" After considerable volatility in the 1970s and 1980s, o ver the  past few decades , inflation —especially  core inflation,  which excludes volatile food and energy prices —has, with rare exceptions,  moved only within a relatively narrow range in many countries despite significant swings in the prices of oil and other commodities,  - 5 - recessions, the Global Financial  Crisis, and unprecedented monetary policy actions."
" Reflecting this,  inflation volatility, as measured by the standard deviation in quart erly inflation rates, has declined ."
" (See table 2 , “Standard Deviation of Annualized Quarterly Headline Inflation Rates .”)  What has been behind this global decline in inflation volatility?"
" I would argue, as have many others, that monetary policy played a key role in reducing not only the average rate of inflation , but also the volatility of inflation.7  Inflation -targeting monetary policy can plausibly influence the variance of inflation through several channels."
" For example, in a textbook DSGE (dynamic stochastic general equilibrium) model (Clarida, Galí, and Gertler  (CGG),  1999) featuring a central ban k that implements policy via a Taylor -type rule, the equilibrium variance of inflation will be lower the more aggressively the central bank leans against exogenous shocks that push inflation away from target."
" So even if the variance of inflation shocks is  constant, the variance of inflation itself will be an endogenous function of monetary policy."
 Another related channel through which monetary policy can influence the variance of inflation is by changing the equilibrium persistence  of inflation deviations  from target.
" In the textbook CGG model (1999) , augmented with a hybrid Phillips curve that features an inertial backward -looking component, the equilibrium persistence of inflation is an endogenous function of the monetary policy rule such that the more aggressively the central bank leans against exogenous shocks that push inflation away from target, the less persistent are inflation deviations from target in equilibrium."
 In the simple case in which equilibrium inflation is a first -order autoregressive p rocess (as it is in the CGG (1999)                                                 7 This view has also long been shared by fellow monetary policymakers.
"     - 6 - model under optimal policy), the equilibrium unconditional variance of inflation is monotonic in inflation persistence for any given constant variance of inflation shocks."
" Of course, non -monetary factors may also have co ntributed to a lower variance of inflation."
" For example, the variance of underlying exogenous shocks to aggregate supply and demand may have fortuitously and coincidentally fallen in tandem with the adoption  of inflation targeting in many countries."
" Decomposing the factors that drive equilibrium term premiums is an active area of academic research , and I will not attempt to summarize or synthesize this vast literature.8  But I would like to emphasize  what seems to me to be three contributors to the decline in the term premium in the United States and perhaps in other  countries as well.9   First, the decline in inflation volatility has almost certainly been important in driving the term premium on nominal bonds lower."
" The real expost payoff from holding a nominal bond to maturity is directly exposed to price -level risk , and thus, all else being equal, a decline in inflation volatility makes the real purchasing power of the bond’s payoff less risky."
" Through this channel , the decline in inflation volatility should be reflected in a smaller inflation risk premium in nominal bond yields , which  is exactly                                                 8 Gürkaynak and Wright (2012) provide a survey."
" Indee d, this  yield curve model attributes around 100 basis points of the decline in the U.S. 10year nominal term premium since the early 1990s to a decline in the inflation risk  premium ."
 A third contributor to a lower U.S. term premium is much less widely appreciated than lower inflation volatility and LSAPs .
" This paper develops and estimates a habit persistence consumption asset pricing model in which the sign of the equilibrium covariance between equity and bond r eturns depends on the reduced -form correlation between inflation and the output gap, the correlation between the federal funds rate and the output gap, as well as the equilibrium persistence of inflation."
" CPV document in U.S. data,  for a sample spanning 1979: Q3 to 2011: Q4, that ( 1) the correlation between inflation and the output gap changed sign from negative to positive ; that ( 2) the correlation between the federal funds rate and the output gap changed sign, also from negative to positive ; and that (3) the evidence of the sign change becomes statistically significant beginning in the late 1990s."
 CPV also document that the transitory component of inflation becomes much less persistent after the estimated  break in their sample.
"  The CPV paper is agnostic as to why the reduced -form correlation between inflation and the output gap and that between the federal funds rate and the output gap both change sign in their sample, but the authors do demonstrate that in their asset pricing                                                 12 See, for instance, d’Addona and Kind (2006); Bekaert, Engstrom, and Grenadier (2010); Eraker (2008); and Bansal and Shaliastovich (2013)."
"  I, myself , believe that the change in the U.S. monetary policy regime that began in 1979 under Paul Volcker and t hat was extended by Alan Greenspan in the 1990s very likely contributed to the change in the sign of the correlation between inflation and the output gap  as well as  the change in sign of the correlation between the federal funds rate and the output gap that we observe in the data (C larida, Galí, and G ertler , 2000) ."
" These are the sorts of patterns that a simple model of optimal monetary policy would produce when starting from an initial condition in which inflation is well above the (implicit) target, as was the case in 1979."
" High initial inflation triggers a policy response for the central bank to push up the real policy rate well above inflation in order to push output below potential,  which, via the Phillips curve, will , over time , lower inflation toward  the target."
" If this policy succeeds ex post, inflation expectations become anchored at the new lower level of inflation , and policy can, then, respond to demand shocks by adjusting real rates pro -cyclically, the opposite of what is required when initial inflation is too high and inflation expectations are not anchored.13  Inflation will also be pro -cyclical with well -anchored inflation expectations if demand shocks dominate  and inflation expectations remain anchored."
" Implications for Monetary Policy:  The Federal Reserve’s Framework Review   By lowering expected inflation, by anchoring expected inflation at a low level, by contributing to a reduction in the volatility of inflation—and thus a reduction in the inflation risk premium—and by contributing to crea ting a hedging value of longduration                                                 13 Hoek, Kamin, and Yoldas (2019) show that monetary policy a ctions that are interpreted as responses to rising inflation have more adverse spillovers to emerging markets than actions motivated by growth shocks."
"  - 11 - sovereign bonds, inflationtargeting monetary policy has lowered equilibrium bond yields relative to equilibrium short rates substantially compared with the experience of the 1970s and early 1980s."
 But what does this mean for monetary policy?
"  The reality  of low neutral rates and equilibrium bond yields has motivated us at the Federal Reserve to take a hard look this year at our monetary policy strategy, too ls, and communication practices ."
" While w e believe our existing framework, in place since 2012, has served us wel l, we believe now is a good time to step back and assess whether, and in what possible ways, we can refine our strategy, tools, and communicati on practices to achieve and maintain our goals as consistently and robustly as possible  in the                                                 14 For assessments of the risks that U.S. monetary policy will be constrained by the ELB and its implicat ions for economic activity and inflation, see Kiley and Roberts (2017), Erceg and others (2018), Swanson  (2018), and Chung and others (2019)."
" The first question is, “Can the Federal Reserve best meet its statutory objectives  with it s existing monetary policy strategy, or should it consider strategies that aim to reverse past misses of the inflation objective?”  Central banks are generally believed to have effective tools for preventing persistent inflation overshoots."
" But persistent  inflation shortfalls, such as those associated with the ELB, carry the risk that longer -term inflation expectations become anchored below the stated inflation goal.16  At our September Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) meeting, we discussed options for mitigating ELB risks, including “makeup” strategies in which policymakers would promise to make up for past inflation shortfalls with a sustained accommodative stance of policy intended to generate higher future inflation.17  Such strategies provide accommo dation at the ELB by keeping the policy rate low for an extended period."
 Makeup strategies may also help anchor inflation expectations more firmly at 2 percent than would a policy strategy that does not compensate for past inflation misses.
 An advantage of our current framework over makeup approa ches is that it has provided the Committee with the flexibility to assess a broad range of factors and information in                                                 15 Fuhrer and others (2018) explore the desirability of comprehensive reviews of the monetary policy framework.
 16 These risks could be exacerbated if households and businesses expect monetary policy to be insufficiently accommodative because of proximity to the ELB.
"  We are also considering whether our existing monetary policy tools are adequate to achieve and maintain maximum employment and price stability, or whether  our toolkit should be expanded  and, if so, how."
" In addit ion to using these two additional monetary policy tools, the Federal Reserve implemented a number of other measures to stabilize the financial system, increase household and business confidence, and more generally support the economic recovery."
" These enhancements include the Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy; post -meeting press conferences; various statements about the principl es and strategy guiding the Committee’s normalization of monetary policy; and quarterly summaries of individual FOMC participants’ economic projections, assessments about the appropriate path of the federal funds rate, and judgments of the uncertainty and balance of risks around their projections."
" Starting in 1979, the Federal Reserve published a summary of individual economic projections from various Board members, FOMC members, or FOMC participants in the semiannual Monetary Policy Report."
 One of these challenges is how best to conduct monetary policy in the  new world of low equilibrium interest rates.
" Stepping back, earlier today , speakers at this conference discussed the challenges of making monetary policy in an uncertain and risky environment."
" - 15 - two days present cuttingedge research on the e ffect and measurement of risk and uncertainty and volatility, with a special focus on monetary policy and mark et behavior."
