" I will start with some thoughts about the Federal Reserve’s ongoing effort to lower inflation, which continues to be much too high."
     Monetary Policy  Let me begin by discussing the Fed ’s efforts to lower inflation .
" Inflation is much too high, and I am focused on bringing it down toward our 2 percent goal."
" Inflation affects everyone, but it is  especially harmful to  lower - and middle -income Americans , who spend a greater share of their income on necessities  like food and housing."
"  Over the past year, I have supported the FOMC’s  policy actions to  address high inflation , and I am committed to taking fu rther actions to bring inflation back down to our  1 These views are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee."
" Since last March , the FOMC  has been tightening monetary policy through a combination of increasing the federal funds rate  by 4¼ percent age points  and reducing our balance sheet holdings ."
"  In recent months, we’ve seen a decline in some measures of i nflation but we have a lot more work to do, so I expect the FOMC will continue raising interest rates to tighten monetary policy , as we  stated  after our December meeting .2  My views on the appropriate size of future rate increases and on the ultimate level of the federal funds rate will continue to be guided by the incoming data and its implications for the outlook for inflation and economic activity."
"  I will be looking for compelling signs that inflation has peaked and for more consistent indications that inflation is on a downward path, in determining both the appropriate  size of future rate increases and the level at which the federal funds rate is sufficiently restrictive."
"To this point, unemploy ment has remained low as we have tightened monetary policy and made progress in lowering inflation."
 I take this as a hopeful sign that we can succeed in lower ing inflation without a significant economic downturn.
" It is likely that a s a part of this process, labor markets will soften  somewhat before we bring inflation back  2 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2022), “Federal Reserve Issues FOMC Statement,” press r elease, December 14, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20221214a.htm ."
" While the effects of monetary policy tightening on the job market have generally been limited so far, slowing the economy will likely mean t hat job creation also slows."
" And if there are unforeseen shocks to the economy, growth may slow further."
"  It’s important to keep in mind that there are costs and risks to tightening policy to lower  inflation, but I see the costs and risks of allowing infl ation to persist as far greater."
"economy experienced high inflation , high unemployment, and declining living standards ."
" During that time , policymakers premature ly eased  monetary  policy when the economy weakened, and inflation remained high."
" The FOMC  was forced to return to tightening monetary policy, causing a deep recession  in 1981 and 1982."
 Th is is an  important lesson that guide s my thinking about monetary policy and my continued support for policy actions that will  continue to lower inflation.
  It is also important to remember that today’s inflation is a global concern.
" Th is is because some of the factors driving inflation in the United States are global, including the disruption to goods production and trade during the pandemic, the shutdown and reopening of large econom ies, and the more recent disruption of food and energy suppl ies due to conflicts abroad."
" Monetary policy can do very little to improve supply di sruptions, but it can help bring supply and demand into better alignment."
" So far, the job market has remained resilient despite higher interest rates and slower growth."
 Low debt and strong balance sheets together with the strong labor market mean that consumers and businesses can continue to spend even as economic growth slows.
" As regulators , we should support innovation and recognize that the banking industry must evolve to meet consumer demand."
" By inhibiting  - 5 - innovation, we could be pushing growth in this space into the nonbank sector , leading to much less transparency and potential financial stability risk."
