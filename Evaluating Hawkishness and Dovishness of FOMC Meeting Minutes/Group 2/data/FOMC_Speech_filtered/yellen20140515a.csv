"  After the onset of the crisis, the Feder al Reserve took extraordinary steps to stabilize the financial system and halt the plunge in economic activity."
" Since then, the Fed has continued to use its monetary policy tools to promote the recovery and make progress toward our mandated objectives of maximum employment and price stability."
" By putting downward pressure on interest rates, the Fed is trying to make financial conditions more accommodative --supporting asset values and lower borrowing costs for households and businesses and thus encouraging  the spending that spurs job creation and a stronger recovery."
" About 85 percent of nonfarm employment is in the private sector, which traditionally is the source of a similarly large share of new jobs during economic expansions."
" So far during this expansion, public -sector employment has declined and the priva te sector has accounted for all of the net increase in employment, so businesses have been even more crucial to job creation than usual."
" According to the latest data from th e Labor Department, a little more than half of the net number of jobs created since employment began growing in 2010 has been generated by   - 2 - firms with fewer than 250 employees, and most of that amount was accounted for by  firms with fewer than 50 employees.1   One of the reasons I wanted so much to be here this evening was to be able to acknowledge these important contributions."
