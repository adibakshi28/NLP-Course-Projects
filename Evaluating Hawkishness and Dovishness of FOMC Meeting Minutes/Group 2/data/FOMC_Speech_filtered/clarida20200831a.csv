"For release on delivery  9:00 a.m. EDT  August 31, 2020         The Federal Reserve’s New Monetary Policy Framework: A Robust Evolution     Remarks by  Richard H ."
"Clarida   Vice Chair   Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at the  Peterson Institute for International Economics   Washington, D.C.  (via webcast)         August 31, 2020   Last week, the Federal Reserve reached an important milestone in its ongoing review of its monetary policy strategy, tools, and communication practices with the unanimous  approval and release of a new Statement o n Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strat egy.1  In my remarks today, I will discuss our new framework and highlight some important policy implications that flow from the revised statement and our new strategy.2  I believe that this new statement and strategy represent a critical and robust evolution of our framework that will best equip the Federal Reserve to achieve our dual -mandate objectives on a sustained basis in the world in which we conduct policy today and for the foreseeable future."
" First, I will discuss the factors that motivated the Federal Reserve in November 2018 to announce it would undertake in 2019 the first -ever public review of its monetary policy strat egy, tools, and communication practices."
" Third, I will briefly summarize the flexible inflation -targeting strategy that has been guiding U.S. monetary policy since 2012 in the context of some important changes in the economic landscape that have become eviden t since 2012."
" Last week, Chair Powell made the review and the revised statement the focus of his speech at “Navigating the Decade Ahead:  Implications  for Monetary Policy,”  a symposium sponsored by t he Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  and held  in Jackson Hole, Wyoming; see Powell (2020)."
"  I would like to thank Etienne Gagnon, Ellen Meade, Jon Faust, and Trevor Reeve for their assistance in preparing these remarks, and Thomas Laubach for sharing with me throughout the review process his many keen insights on monetary policy strategy and communication."
"  - 2 - Fourth, I will discuss the major findings of the review as codified in our new Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy and highlight some important policy implications that flow from them."
" Indeed, I would argue that over the past eight years, the framework served us well and supported the Federal Reserve’s efforts after the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) first to achieve and then, for several years, to sustain —until cut short this spring by the COVID -19 pandemic —the operation of the economy at or close to both our statutorily assigned goals of maximum employment and price stability in what became the longest economic expansion in U .S."
" Nonetheless, both the U.S. economy—and, equally importantly, our understanding of the economy—have clearly evolved along several crucial dimensions since 2012, and we believed that in 2019 it made sense to step back and assess whether, and in what possible ways, we might refine and rethink our strategy, tools, and communication practices to achieve and sustain our goals as consistently and robustly as possible in the global economy in which we operate today and for the foreseeable future.3 Perhaps the most significant change since 2012 in our understanding of the economy is our reassessment of the neutral real interest rate, r*, that , over the longer run,                                                  3 For a discussion of the elements that motivated the launch of the review and of how the previous policy framework had served us, see Clarida (2019b)."
  - 3 - is consistent with our m aximumemployment and price -stability mandates.
" In January 2012, the median FOMC participant projected a longrun r* of 2.25 percent, which, in tandem with the inflation goal of 2 percent, indicated a neutral setting for the federal funds rate of 4.25 per cent."
" Moreover, as is well appreciated, the decline in neutral policy rates since the GFC is a global phenomenon that is widely expected by forecasters and financial markets to persist for years to come.5 The substantial decline in the neutral policy rate since 2012 has critical implications for the design, implementation, and communication of Federal Reserve monetary policy because it leaves the FOMC with less conventional policy space to cut rates to offset adverse shocks to aggregate demand."
" The downward revisions to r* over time have been informed, in part, by the general fall in interest rates and by econometric evidence that suggests that this fall is of a permanent rather than a cyclical nature."
" For a discussion of global considerations for U.S. monetary policy, see Obstfeld (2020)."
"  - 4 - economic downturns, the effective lower bound (ELB) will constrain the ability of the FOMC to rely solely on the federal funds rate instrument to offset adverse shocks.6  This development, in turn, makes it more likely that recessions will impart elevated risks of more persistent downward pressure on inflation and upward pressure on unemployment that the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy should, in design and implementation, seek to offset throughout the business cycle and not just in downturns themselves.7  Two other, related developments that have also become more evident than they appeared in 2012 are that price inflation seems less responsive to resource slack , and also, that estimates of resource slack based on historically estimated price Phillips curve relationships are less reliable and subject to more material revision than w as once commonly believed.8  For example, in the face of declining unemployment rat es that did not result in excessive cost -push pressure to price inflation, the median of the Committee’s projections of u* —the rate of unemployment consistent in the longer run with the 2 percent inflation objective —has been repeatedly revised lower, from                                                  6 For assessments of the risk that the federal funds rate will be constrained by the ELB in the future, along with policy strategies that might mitigate that risk, see Kiley and Roberts (2017); Chung and others (2019); Hebden and López -Salido (2018); and Be rnanke, Kiley, and Roberts (2019)."
" For the GFC and its aftermath, using a time -series approach, Eberly, St ock, and Wright (2020) estimate that, in the absence of the ELB constraint, the labor market recovery would have proceeded at a significantly more rapid pace than was observed, whereas core inflation would have been only modestly higher because of inflatio n’s limited sensitivity to resource slack."
 The difficulties in assessing shortfalls from maximum employment using measures of the unemployment rate has motivated researchers  to explore alternative approaches.
" See also the staff discussion of various concepts of unemployment rate benchmarks by Crump, Nekarda, and Petrosky -Nadeau (2020), which was prepared as background materials for this review."
"  - 5 - 5.5 percent in January 2012 to 4.1 percent as of the June 2020 SEP.9  Projections of u* by the C ongressional B udget O ffice and professional forecasters show a similar decline during this same period and for the same reason.10  In the past several years of t he previous expansion, declines in the unemployment rate occurred in tandem with a notable and, to me, welcome increase in real wages that was accompanied by an increase in labor’s share of national income, but not a surge in price inflation to a pace inconsistent with our price -stability mandate and well -anchored inflation expectations."
" Indeed, this pattern of mid -cycle declines in unemployment coincident with noninflationary increases in real wage s has been evident in the U.S. data since the 1990s.11  With regard to inflation expectations, there is broad agreement among academics and policymakers that achieving price stability on a sustainable basis requires that inflation expectations be well anchored at the rate of inflation consistent with the price -stability goal."
" This is especially true in the world that prevails today, with flat Phillips curves in which the primary determinant of actual inflation is expected inflation.12  The                                                  9 The large degree of uncertainty attached to estimates of r*, u*, the slope of the (short -run) Phillips curve, and other key economic objects adds additional risk -management considerations in the conduct of monetary policy, especially in a low r* environment in which the federal funds rate is likely to be constrained by the ELB."
 See Powell (2019b) for a discussion of the implications for monetary policy and my recent remarks in Clarida (2020).
12 See Yellen (2015) for a discussion of inflation dynamics and monetary policy  and Erceg and others (2018) for a quantitative exploration of the monetary policy implications of a flat Phillips curve in an uncertain economic environment.
" Since the mid1980s, movements in both realized inflation and measures of longer -term inflation expectat ions have been somewhat muted, complicating the task of extracting the precise role of inflation expectations as a determinant of realized inflation."
 Faust and Wright (2013) review the literature on inflation forecasting and present evidence in support of  the conclusion that measures of longer -run inflation expectations help predict inflation.
" Mavroeidis, Plagborg -Møller , and Stock (2014) discuss the challenges of identifying the precise role of expectations in determining actual inflation."
" Cecchetti and  others (2017) suggest that, in a low and stable inflation environment, policymakers should pay attention to a wide array of indicators in determining the implications for monetary policy of movements in realized inflation and measures of inflation expectations."
"  - 6 - preGFC academic literature derived the important result that a credible inf lation -targeting monetary policy strategy that is not constrained by the ELB can deliver, under rational expectations, inflation expectations that themselves are well anchored at the inflation target.13  In other words, absent a binding ELB constraint, a policy that targets actual inflatio n in these models delivers long -run inflation expectations well anchored at the target “for free.”  But this “copacetic coincidence” no longer holds in a world of low r* in which adverse aggregate demand shocks are expected  to drive the economy in at least some downturns to the ELB."
" In this case, which is obviously relevant today, economic analysis indicates that flexible inflation -targeting monetary policy cannot be relied on to deliver inflation expectations that are anch ored at the target, but instead will tend to deliver inflation expectations that , in each business cycle, become anchored at a level below the target.14 This is the crucial insight in my colleague John Williams’ research with Thomas Mertens."
"  Indeed John’s research over the past 20 years on r* estimation  and monetary policy design at the ELB have been enormously influential , not only in the profession but also at Fed and certainly in my own thinking about how our framework should evolve."
 This  downward bias in inflation expectations under inflation targeting in an ELB world can in turn reduce already scar ce policy space —because nominal interest rate s reflect both real rates and expected inflation —and it can open up the risk of the downward spiral in both actual and expected inflation that has been observed in some other major economies .
                                                 13 See Bernanke and others (1999) for a review of the considerations that led to the adoption of inflationtargeting frameworks and the early international experience.
" See Svensson (1997), Clarida, Gal í, and Gertler (1999), and Woodford (2003) for c onceptual treatments of inflation targeting, including of rational expectations."
"  - 7 - Inflation expectations are , of course , not directly observed and must be imperfectly inferred from surveys, financial market data, and econometric models."
" But , at minimum, the failure of actual PCE (perso nal consumption expenditures) inflation —core or headline —over the past eight years to reach the 2 percent goal on a sustained basis cannot have contributed favorably to keeping inflation expectations anchored at 2 percent."
" Indeed,  my reading of the evidence is that the various measures of inflation expectations I follow reside at the low end of a range I consider consistent with our 2 percent inflation goal.15 The Review Process        With this brief overview of important changes in the economic landscape since 2012, I would now like to discuss the review process itself."
" In November 2018, the Federal Reserve announced that in 2019 the System would undertake a wide -ranging, public review of its monetary policy strategy, tools, and communication practices."
 This initiative  would be the first -ever public  review of monetary policy strategy ever undertaken by the Fed.
" A collection of  the staff memos  prepared f or the  review is n ow available on  the Board’s website.18 A New E conomic Landscape Compels a F ramework Re Think    As I m entioned ear lier, t he Committee devoted five consecutive FOMC  meetings between July 2019 and January 2020 to presentations by the staff and  Committee discussions of memos touching on various aspects of the framework review, and it held a lengthy discussion at the July 2020 FOMC meeting about the new Statement on LongerRun Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy.19  While it is f air to say tha t these C ommittee discussions revealed among the 17 participants a healt hy range of views about and priorities for refining our framework and strategy, some common themes did emerge, and these provided the foundation for the revised Statement on LongerRun Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy that the Committee discussed i n July, approved last week, and release d on Thursday, A ugust 27."
"Broadly, we agreed that the economic landscape has changed in important ways since 2012 and that, as a result, the existi ng statement and the monetary policy strategy 18 An overview of the System staff work in support of the review is presented in Altig and others (2020)."
" - 10 - that flows from it need as well to evolve along several dimensions.20  For example, under our previous flexible inflation -targeting framework, the Federal Reserve declared that the 2 percent inflation objective is “symmetric.”  This term has been interpreted by many observers to mean that the Committee’s reaction function aim ed to be symmetric on either side of the 2 percent inflation goal, and that the FOMC set policy with the (ex ante) aim that the 2 percent goal should represent an inflation ceiling in economic expansions following economic downturns in which inflation falls below target."
" Regarding the ELB, the previous  statement was silent on the global decline in neutral policy rates, the likelihood that the ELB will constrain monetary policy space in economic downturns, and the implications of this constraint  for our ability to achieve our dual -mandate goals."
" As for inflation expectations, the previous  statement d id discuss expected inflation, but only in the context of mentioning that the announcement of a 2 percent goal helps anchor inflation expectations."
" While this is certainly true, it does beg the deeper question of how well anchored inflation expectations can be if the 2 percent goal is seen by the public as—and turns out ex post to be —a ceiling."
" Regarding the maximum -employment leg of the dual mandate, the previous  statement’s discussion of minimizing “deviations” of employment from its maximum level does not adequately reflect how the FOMC has actually conducted monetary policy in recent years —before the pandemic —as t he actual unemployment rate was declining and, for several years, remained below SEP median                                                  20 The FOMC published  the statement for the first time alongside its January 2012 postmeeting sta tement ; the document is available on the Board’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20120125c.htm ."
"  - 11 - projection s of u* (although, to be sure, the earlier  statement did acknowledge that it can be difficult to estimate the maximum level of employment with precision).21 The New Statement and Strategy  Before discussing how our Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy has evolved, let me highlight some important elements that remain unchanged."
" Second, our statement continues to note that the maximum level of employment that we are mandated to achieve is not directly measurable and changes over time for reasons unrelated to monetary policy."
" Hence, we continue not to specify a numerical goal for our employment objective as we do for inflation."
" Third, we continue to state that an inflation rate of 2 percent over the longer run is most consistent with our mandate to p romote both maximum employment and price stability."
" Finally, because the effect of monetary policy on the economy operates with a lag, our strategy remains forward looking."
" With respect to  the new framework itself, the statement now notes that the neutral level of the federal funds rate has declined relative to its historical average and therefore that the policy rate is more likely than in the past to be constrained by its ELB , and, moreover, that this binding ELB constraint is likely to impart downside risks t o inflation and employment that the Committee needs to consider in implementing its monetary                                                  21 See my earlier remarks on these aspects in Clarida (2018a, 2018b, 2019a)."
" In this regard, the statement now highlights that the Committee is prepared to use its full range of tools to achieve its d ualmandate objectives.22      Regarding the maximum -employment mandate, the new statement now acknowledges that maximum employment is a “broadbased and inclusive goal” and continues to state that the FOMC considers a wide range of indicators to assess the level of maximum employment consistent with this broadbased goal."
" However, under our new framework, policy decisions going forward will be based on the FOMC’s estimates of “shortfalls  of employment from its maximum level” —not “deviations .”23  This change  conveys our judgment that a low unemployment rate by itself, in the absence of evidence that price inflation is running or is likely to run persistently above mandate -consistent levels or pressing financial stability concerns, will not , under our new fram ework , be a sufficient trigger for policy action.24  This is a robust evolution in the Federal Reserve’s policy framework and, to me, reflects the reality that econometric models of maximum employment, while essential inputs to monetary policy, can be and have been wrong, and, moreover, that a decision to tighten monetary policy based solely on a model without any other evidence of excessive cost -push pressure that puts the pricestability mandate at risk is difficult to justify , given the significant cost to the economy if the model turns out to be                                                  22 FOMC participants discusse d the benefits, limitations, and risks associated with policy tools other than the setting of the federal funds rate target at various points during the review."
" 24 For a discussion of financial stability considerations in the conduct of monetary policy, see Kashyap  and Siegert  (2020) and Goldberg and others (2020), prepared as part of this review."
"  - 13 - wrong and given the ability of monetary policy to respond if the model were eventually to turn out to be right.25      With regard  to the price -stability mandate, while the new statemen t maintains our definition that the longer -run goal for inflation is 2 percent, it elevates the importance —and the challenge —of keeping inflation expectations “well anchored at 2 percent ”  (and not just “well anchored”) in a world of low r* and an ELB cons traint that is binding in downturns.26  To this end, the new statement conveys the Committee’s judgment that, in order to anchor expectations at 2 percent, it “ seeks to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time,” and —in the same sentence —that therefore “following periods when inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time.”  This is the second robust evolution of our framework, and it  reflects the inherent asymmetry of conducting monetary policy in a low r* world with an ELB constraint that binds in economic downturns."
" As discussed earlier, if policy seeks only to return inflation to 2 percent following a downturn in which the ELB has  constrained policy, an inflationtargeting monetary policy will tend to generate inflation that averages less than 2 percent , which, in turn, will tend to put persistent downward pressure on inflation expectations                                                  25 As I stated in Clarida (2019a, paragraph 17), “ For example, were models to predict a surge in inflation, a decision for preemptive hikes before the surge is evident in actual data would need to be balanced against the cost of the mod el being wrong."
 A clear takeaway from our Fed Listens  events is that the strong job market t hat preceded the pandemic was especially beneficial to members of low - and moderate -income communities.
 See also Feiveson  and others (2020) for a discussion of distributional considerations and monetary policy.
" In order to offset this downward bias, our new framework recognizes that monetary policy during economic expansions needs to “aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time.”  In other words, the aim to achieve symmetric outcomes  for inflation (as would be the case under flexible inflation targeting in the absence of the ELB constraint) requires an asymmetric monetary policy reaction function in a low r* world with binding ELB constraints in economic downturns."
" It is for this reason that while our new statement no longer refers to the 2 percent inflation goal as symmetric, it does now say that the Committee “seek s to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time.”  To be clear, “inflation that averages 2 percent over time” represents an ex ante aspiration, not a description of a mechanical reaction function—nor is it a commitment to conduct monetary policy tethered to any particular formula or rule.27  Indeed, as summarized in the minutes of the September 2019 FOMC meeting, the Co mmittee (and , certainly , I) was skeptical about the benefit, credibility, or practicality of adopting a formal numerical price level or average inflation target rule, just as it has been unwilling to implement its existing flexible inflation -targeting stra tegy via any sort of mechanical rule.28  So in practice, what , then , is the                                                  27 The absence of a commitment to a specific formula or rule should not be interpreted as the absence of a commitment  to achieving our mandated goals."
" Notably, it has clarified that we seek to achieve 2  percent inflation, on average, over time and that, when inflation has been running persistently too low, it is appropriate to aim for inflation outcomes moderately above 2 percent for some time to solidly anchor longer -run inflation expectations at 2  percent."
" For a discussion of time -consistency issues in monetary policy, see the staff analysis of Duarte and others (2020), prepared for this review."
 See also the related staff analysis by Chung and others (2020) on the use of operational inflation ranges.
  - 15 - policy implication of this stated desire “to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time”?
" Again, the implication of our new strategy for monetary policy is stated explicit ly in the new statement , and, at the risk of repeating myself, let me restate it verbatim:  “… following periods when inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above  2 percent for some time.”  Full stop."
" As Chair Powell indicated in his remarks last week, we think of this new strategy as an evolution from flexible inflation targeting to flexible average inflation targeting.29 Concluding Thoughts  My remarks today have been focused on our new framework and flexible average inflation targeting strategy ."
" With regard to other monetary policy tools, and as we have made clear previously  in the minutes to our October  2019 FOMC meeting , we do not see negative policy rates as an attractive policy option in the U.S. context.30  As for targeting the yield curve, our general view is that with credible forward guidance and asset purchases, the potential benefits from such an approach may be modest."
" At the same                                                  29 Svensson (2020) argues that “forecast targeting” approaches, by which policymakers set the federal funds rate so as to best stabilize forecasts for inflation and employment around the FOMC’s longer -run goals, outperform policy strategies that respond only to current economic conditions, past economic conditions, or both."
" In addition, he finds that average inflation targeting offers some advantages over the other strategies that he considers."
" It was the right statement, and flexible inflation targeting was the right strategy, at that time and for the next eight years ."
  - 17 - our framework and strategy need to change as well.33  My colleagues and I believe that this new framework represents a critical and robust evolution of our monetary policy strategy  that will best equip the Federal Reserve to achieve our dual -mandate objectives on a sustained basis in the world in which we conduct policy today and for the foreseeable future.

" The Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) is firmly committed to fulfilling its statutory mandate from the Congress of promoting maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long -term interest rates."
"  Such clarity facilitates well -informed decisionmaking by households and businesses, reduces economic and financial uncertainty, increases the effectiveness of monetary policy, and enhances transparency and accountability, which are essential in a democratic society."
" Employment,  inflation , employment,  and longterm interest rates fluctuate over time in response to economic and financial disturbances."
  Monetary policy plays an important role in stabilizing the economy in response to these disturbances.
 The Committee’s primary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy is through changes in the target range for the federal funds rate.
 The Committee judges that the level of the federal fund s rate consistent with maximum employment and price stability over the longer run has declined relative to its historical average.
"  Owing in part to the proximity of interest rates to the effective lower bound, the Committee judges that downward risks to employment and inflation have increased."
" Moreover, monetary policy actions tend to influence economic activity and prices with a lag."
 The maximum level of employment is a broad -based and inclusive goal that is not directly measurable and changes over time owing  largely determined by  to nonmonetary factors that affect the structure and dynamics of the labor market.
"  Consequently, it would not be appropriate to specify a fixed goal for employment; rather, the Committee ’s policy decisions must be informed by assessments of the shortfalls of employment from its  maximum level of employment , recognizing that such assessments are necessarily uncertain and subject to revision."
  Information about Committee participants’ estimates of the longer -run normal rates of output growth and unemployment is published four times per year in the FOMC’s Summary of Economic Projec tions.
" For example, in the most recent projections, the median of FOMC participants’ estimates of the longer -run normal rate of unemployment was 4.4  percent."
" The inflation rate over the longer run is primarily determined by monetary policy, and hence the Committee has the ability to specify a longer -run goal for inflation."
"  The Committee reaffirms its judgment  that inflation at the rate of 2  percent, as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, is most con sistent over the longer run with the Federal Reserve ’s statutory mandate."
  The Committee would be concerned if inflation were running persistently above or below this objective.
" Communicating this symmetric inflation goal clearly to the public helps keep  judges that  longer -term inflation expectations firmly  that are well anchored , thereby  at 2 percent  foster ing price stability and moderate longterm interest rates and enhancing enhance  the Committee ’s ability to promote maximum employment in the face of si gnificant economic disturbances."
"  In order to anchor longer -term inflation expectations at this level, the Committee seeks to achieve inflation that averages Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy  Adopted effective January 24, 2012; a s amended  effective January 29, 2019  August 2 7, 2020   In the revised Statement o n Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy shown below, underlined bold red  text shows additions and struck through  text shows deletions relative to the statement the Committee issued on January 29, 2019."
  Note that the discussion of the employment and inflation goals ha s been separated into two paragraphs and their order reversed relative to the January 2019 statement .
" 2 percent over time, and therefore judges that, following periods when inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time."
" Monetary policy actions tend to influence economic activity, employment, and prices with a lag."
" In setting moneta ry policy, the Committee seeks over time to mitigate shortfalls of employment from the Committee’s assessment of its maximum level and deviations of inflation from its longer -run goal and deviations of employment from the Committee’s assessments of its max imum level ."
" Moreover, sustainably achieving maximum employment and price stability depends on a stable financial system."
 These  The Committee’s employment and inflation  objectives are generally complementary.
"  However, under circumstances in which the Committee judges that the objectives are not complementary, it follows a balanced approach in promoting them, taking takes  into account the magnitude of the  employment shortfalls and inflation  deviations and the p otentially differ ent time horizons over which employment and inflation are projected to return to levels judged consistent with its mandate."
" The Committee intends to reaffirm  review  these principles and to make adjustments as appropriate at its annual organizational meeting each January , and to undertake roughly  every five years a thorough public review of its monetary policy strategy, tools, and communication practices ."
