" In doing so , I will draw from  talks and testimonies that I gave during the crisis and its aftermath , particularly  my testimony to the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission in September 2010.1  Given the time available , I will focus  narrowly  on the financial crisis and  the Federal Reserve’s response  in its capacity as liquidity provider of last resort , leaving  discussions of monetary policy and the aftermath of the crisis to another occasion ."
"  In part, the rapid growth of shadow banking reflected various types of regulatory arbitrage --for example, the minimization of capital requirements ."
" However, instruments that fund the shadow bank ing system, such as money market mutual funds and repos, als o met a rapidly growing demand among investors , generally large  institution s and corporations, seeking cash -like assets for use in  manag ing their liquidity."
 Commercial banks were limited  in their ability to meet this growing demand  by prohibitions on the payment of interest on business checking accounts and by relatively low limits on the size of deposit accounts that can be insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ).
"  Indeed, the very foundation of shadow banking and its rapid growth before the crisis was the widely held view (among both investors and regulators)  that these safeguards would protect shadow bank ing activ ities against runs and panics , similar to the protection given to commercial banking by the government safety net ."
" Volatile asset prices and weaker borrower balance sheets in turn heightened  the risks borne by repo lenders , further boost ing the incentives to demand higher  haircuts or withdraw funding entirely."
" In some cases, withdrawals of funds  by creditors were augmented by “runs”  in other guises --for example, by prime brokerage customers of investment banks concerned about the safety of cash and securities held at those firms or by derivatives counterparties demanding additional margin .8  Overall, the emergence of runlike phenomena in a variety of contexts  helps  explain the remarkably sharp and sudden intensification of the financial crisis, its rapid global spread, and the fact that standard market indicators  largely failed to forecast the abrupt deterioration in financial conditions ."
" This desired outcome in fact occurred :  By early 2010, emergency lending had been drastically reduced, along with the demand for such lending."

" Going forward, for the Federal Reserve as well as other central banks, the promotion of financial stability must be on an equal footing with the management of monetary policy as  the most critical policy priorities."
