"  Before  diving into those  topics, I will share  my current views on the economy and monetary policy."
" Economic and Monetary Policy Outlook  Over the past two years, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has significantly tightened the stance of monetary policy to address high inflation."
" After seeing considerable progress last year, in recent months we have seen some further progress on lowering inflation."
" The 12month measures of total and core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation, which I prefer to the  more volatile higher -frequency readings, have moved down since April, although they have remained somewhat elevated at 2.5 percent and 2.6 percent in June, respectively."
 - 2 -  indicate that 12month core PCE inflation likely remained a bit above 2.5 percent in July .
" The progress in lowering inflation since April is a welcome development, but inflation is still uncomfortably above the Committee’s 2 percent goal."
" Inflation has hit lowerincome households hardest , since food, energy, and housing services price increases far outpaced overall inflation over the past few years."
 Economic activity moderated in the first half of this year after increasing at a strong pace last year.
" Private domestic final purchases ( PDFP)  growth was solid and slowed much less than gross domestic product ( GDP ), as the slowdown in GDP growth was partly driven by volatile categories such as net exports, suggesting that underlying economic growth was stronger than GDP indicated."
" Unusually strong consumer goods spending last year softened in the first quarter of this year, largely accounting for the ste pdown in PDFP growth."
" After slowing in the second quarter, payroll employment gains eased to a more modest pace in July, even as job openings are being filled by the increased immigrant labor supply."
 The latest labor market repo rt shows that the unemployment rate stood at 4.3 percent in - 3 -  July.
" Although notably higher than a year ago, this is still a historically low unemployment rate."
" We are also seeing a slowing in wage growth, which now stands at just under 4 percent as measured by the employment cost index."
" However, given trend productivity, wage gains remain  above the pace consistent with our inflation goal."
 My baseline outlook is that inflation will decline further with the current stance of monetary policy.
" Should the incoming data continue to show that inflation is moving sustainably toward our 2 percent goal, it will become appropriate to gradually lower the federal funds rate to prevent monetary policy from becoming overly restrictive on economic activity and employment."
 But we need to be patient and avoid undermining continued progress on lowering inflation by overreacting to any single data point.
" Ins tead, we must view the data in their totality as the risks to the Committee’s employment and price -stability mandates continue to move into better balance."
" That said, I still see some upside risks to inflation  as supply conditions have now largely normalized and any further improvements to supply seem less likely  to offset price  pressures arising from increasing geopolitical tensions , additional fiscal stimulus, and increased demand for housing due to immigration ."
"There are also risks that the labor market has not been as strong as the payroll data have been indicating, and it  appears that the recent rise in unemployment may be exaggerating the degree of cooling in labor markets."
" The Q4 Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) report suggests that job gains have been consistently overstated in the establishment survey since March of last year, while the household survey unemployment data have become - 4 -  less accurate as response rates have appreciably declined since the pandemic.2  The rise in the unemployment rate this year largely reflects weaker hiring, as job searchers entering the labor force are taking longer to find work , and  layoffs remain low."
 It is also likely that some temporary factors contributed to the soft July employment report.
 The rise in the unemployment rate in July was largely  accounted for  by workers who are experiencing a temporary layoff and are more likely to be rehired in coming months .
" In light of upside risks to inflation and uncertainty regarding labor market conditions and the economic outlook, I will continue to watch the data closely as I assess the appropriate path of monetary policy."
 It is important to note that monetary policy is not on a preset course.
" In my view, we should consider a range of possible scenarios that could unfold when assessing how the FOMC’s monetary policy decisions may evolve."
 My colleagues and I will make our decisions at each FOMC meeting based on the incoming data and the implications for and risks to the outlook and guided by the Fed’s dual -mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices.
" By the time of our September meeting, we will have seen addition al economic data and information,  2  The Q4 Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages ( QCEW ) administrative data show employment gains that are about 110,000 per month lower than what the Current Employment Statistics ( CES) survey reported from March 2023 to December 2023."
" Although the Bureau of Labor Statistics  benchmarks CES payroll employment based on the Q1 QCEW, to be released on August 21, the Q4 QCEW data point to a substantial downward revision to CES employment gains last year."
 - 5 -  including one employment and one inflation report.
 I will continue to closely watch  the data and visit with a broad range of contacts as I assess economic conditions and the appropriateness of our monetary policy stance.
" As I noted earlier, I continue to view inflation as somewhat elevated."
" And with some upside risks to inflation, I still see the need to pay close attention to the price -stability side of our mandate while watching for risks of a material weakening in the labor market."
 My view continues to be that restoring price stability is essential for achieving maximum employment o ver the longer run.
  This perspective help s us gain insights into economic activity and the impact of our policies on rural and underserved communities.
" For example, there are many Native CDFIs, including several here in Alaska, that support Native communities by providing access to credit, capital, and financial services.9  While there has been some significant growth in Native CDFIs,10 they cannot singlehandedly resolve the credit needs of this population."
