 These alternative data have  transformed the way economists forecast future outcomes and measure the effectiveness of monetary policy.
" In addition to the challenge of how to best use these tools and data at the Fed, R&S faces the challenge of understanding what these new technologies mean for labor productivity and the economy."
" In addition, in 2003, Alan Greenspan observed, “Uncertainty is not just an important feature of the monetary policy landscape; it is the defining characteristic of that landscape” (Greenspan, 2003)."
"In 1967, William Brainard  argued that uncertainty about the power of monetary policy implied that policy should respond more cautiously to shocks than would be the case if this uncertainty did not exist (Brainard, 1967)."
 Brainard ’s attenuation principle  is a classic example of what has come to be known as the Bayesian approach to uncertainty and is often cited as the foundation for the gradualism in the adjustment of monetary policy.
" In other words, to protect against uncertainty , the appropriate response may be a quick and strong monetary policy response."
" In this situation, words like “we will do whatever it takes” will likely be more effective than “we will take cautious steps.”  The second case is when inflation expectations threaten to become unanchored."
" If expectations were to begin to drift, the reality or expectation of a weak monetary policy response would ex acerbate the problem.4   How to respond to uncertainty is a matter that the Federal Open Market Committee, with the help of R&S, has been wrestling with for a long time."
" While I could be wrong, as of today, I do not foresee that some allpowerful artificial intelligence will  4 For example, Soderstrom (2002) shows that when there is uncertainty about the persistence of inflation , it is better to implement monetary policy that is aggressive than gradual."
" Therefore, I expect that long into the future, we’ll be relying on the knowledge and good judgment of the people of R&S to weigh the risks and to help in providing options to monetary policymakers so that they can make informed decisions."
