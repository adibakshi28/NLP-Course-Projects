" Indeed, since the recession trough in mid2009, growth in real gross dom estic product (GDP) has averaged only a little more than 2 percent per year."
"  Similarly, the job market has improved over the past three year s, but at a slow pace."
" The unemployment rate, which peaked  at 10 percent in the fall of 2009, has since come down 2 percentage point s to just below 8 percent."
" This decline is obviously welcome, but it has taken a long time to ach ieve that progress, and the unemployment rate is still well above both its  level prior to the onset of the recession and the level that my colleagues and I think can be sustained once a full recovery has been achieved."
"   - 2 -Moreover, many other features of the jobs ma rket, including the historically high level of longterm unemployment, the large number of people working part time because they have not been able to find fulltime jobs, and the decline in labor  force participation, reinforce the conclusion that we have some way to go before the labor market can be deemed healthy again."
"Meanwhile, inflation has generally rema ined subdued."
" As is often the case, inflation has been pushed up and down in recen t years by fluctuations in the price of crude oil and other globally traded commoditie s, including the increase in farm prices brought on by this summer’s drought."
" But w ith longerterm inflation expectations remaining stable, the ebbs and flows in commod ity prices have had only transitory effects on inflation."
" Indeed, since the recovery began about three years ago, consumer price inflation, as measured by the personal cons umption expenditures (PCE) price index, has averaged almost exactly 2 percent, whic h is the FOMC’s longerrun objective for inflation.1  Because ongoing slack in labor a nd product markets should continue to restrain wage and price increases, and with th e public’s inflation expectations continuing to be well anchored,  inflation over the next fe w years is likely to remain close to or a little below the Committee’s objective."
"As background for our monetary policy  decisionmaking, we at the Federal Reserve have spent a good deal of effort attempting to understand the reasons why the economic recovery has not been stronger."
" St udies of previous financial crises provide one helpful place to start.2  This literature has found that severe financial crises--                                                 1 Inflation excluding food and energy has averaged a little less, about 11/2 percent, over this period."
" While th is result allows for many interpretations, one possibility is that financia l crises, or the deep recessions that typically accompany them, may reduce an economy’s poten tial growth rate, at  least for a time."
The accumulating evidence does appear consis tent with the financial crisis and the associated recession having reduced th e potential growth rate of our economy somewhat during the past few years.
" In pa rticular, slower growth of potential output would help explain why the unemployment rate has declined in the face of the relatively modest output gains we have seen during the recovery."
" Output normally has to increase at about its longerterm trend ju st to create enough jobs to absorb new entrants to the labor market, and fasterthan-trend growth is  usually needed to reduce unemployment."
" So the fact that unemployment has declined in recent years despite economic growth at about 2 percent suggests that the growth rate of potential output must have recently been lower than the roughly 21/2 per cent rate that appeared to be  in place before the crisis.3                                                                                                                                                    “Credit Booms Gone Bust:  Monetary Policy, Leverage Cycles, and Financial Crises, 18702008,” American Economic Review , vol."

"3 That said, GDP growth in excess of potential is probably not the whole explanation for the decline in unemployment."
" Some of the decline in unemployment during the recovery could also reflect a reversal of the especially large increases that oc curred during the deepest part of the recession, when firms appeared to cut their workforces by  greater numbers than would normally be as sociated with the decline in GDP."
"Bernanke (2012), “Recent Deve lopments in the Labor Mark et,” speech delivered at the National Association for Business Economics 28th Annual Economic Policy Conference, Arlington, Va., March 26,   www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20120326a.htm.)  A reduction in the number of people receiving extended or emerge ncy unemployment insurance benefits may have contributed to the decline in unemployment as well."
    - 4 -There are a number of ways in which the financial crisis could have slowed the rate of growth of the economy’s potential.
" Meanwh ile, the very high level of longterm unemployment has probably led to some loss of skills and labor force attachment among those workers."
 These factors may have pushed up to some degree the socalled natural rate of unemployment--the rate of unemplo yment that can be sustained under normal conditions--and reduced labor force participa tion as well.
" The pace of productivity gains--another key determinant of growth in potential output--may also have been restrained by the crisis, as business investment declined sh arply during the recession; and increases in risk aversion a nd uncertainty, together with ti ght credit conditions, may have impeded the commercial application of new t echnologies and slowed the pace of business formation."
" In particular, even though the natural rate of unemployment may have increased somewhat, a variety of evidence suggests that any such increase has been modest, and that  substantial slack remains in the labor market."
" For example, th e slow pace of employme nt growth has been widespread across industries a nd regions of the country."
" Th at pattern suggests a broadbased shortfall in demand rather than a substantial increase in mismatch between available jobs and workers, because greater  mismatch would imply that the demand for   - 5 -workers would be strong in some regions and industries, not weak almost across the board."
" Likewise, if a mismatch of jobs and workers is the predominant problem, we would expect to see wage pressures devel oping in those regions and industries where labor demand is strong; in fact, wage gains have been quite subdued in most industries and parts of the country.4  Indeed, as I indicated earl ier, the consensus among my colleagues on the FOMC is that the unemploy ment rate is still we ll above its longerrun sustainable level, perhaps by 2 to  21/2 percentage points or so.5   A critical question, then, is  why significant slack in the job market remains three years after the recovery began."
" If so, we may take some encouragement from the likelihood that there are potentially two s ources of faster GDP growth in the future."
"5 In the September 2012 Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), the central tendency of FOMC participants’ estimates of the longrun normal rate of  unemployment ranged from 5.2 to 6 percent."
" 6 For example, mismatch problems in the labor market should fade as the economy strengthens, a further rise in business investment would contribute to faster growth in the capital stock, and an improving economy should cause investors to become less risk averse."
    - 6 -growth should pick up furthe r as many who are currently une mployed or out of the labor force find work.
   Headwinds Affecting the Recovery What are the headwinds that have slow ed the return of our economy to full employment?
" Previous recoveries have often been associated with a vigorous rebound in  housing, as rising incomes and confidence and, often, a decline in mortgage  interest rates led to shar p increases in the demand for homes.7  But the housing bubble and its aftermath ha ve made this episode quite different."
" These developments are encouraging, and it seems lik ely that, on net, residential investment will be a source of economic growth and ne w jobs over the next couple of years."
" Notably, lenders                                                  7 In the recoveries following the 1975 and 1982 recessions, for example, residential construction directly contributed about 1 percentage point to GDP growth during the two years following the recession trough; indirect effects--through th e effect of home prices on consumer spending or through multiplier effects--no doubt added to the contribution."
" While these headwinds on both the supply and demand sides of the housing market have clearly started to abate, the recovery in the housing sector is likely to remain moderate by historical standards."
" Afte r the financial system seized up in late 2008 and early 2009, global economic activity cont racted sharply, and credit and capital markets suffered significant damage."
    - 8 -tight credit and a high degree of  risk aversion have restrained economic growth in the United States and in ot her countries as well.
"  More recently, the situation has to some extent reversed:  The drag on economic growth from state and local fiscal policy has diminished as revenues have improved, easing the pressures for further spending cuts or tax increases."
" In contrast, the phasingout of earlier stimulus programs and policy actions to reduce the federal budget deficit have led federal fiscal policy to begin restra ining GDP growth."
" Indeed, under almost any plausible scenario, next year the drag from federal fiscal policy on GDP growth will outweigh the positive effects on growth from fis cal expansion at the state and local level."
" The budget deficit, which peaked at about 10 percent of GDP in 2009 and now stands at about  7 percent of GDP, is expect ed to narrow further in the coming years as the economy continues to recover."
" However, the CBO projects that, under a plausible set of policy assumptions, the budget deficit would still be greater than 4 percent of GDP in 2018, assuming the econom y has returned to it s potential by then."
" A credib le framework to set federal fiscal policy on a stable path--f or example, one on which the ra tio of federal debt to GDP eventually stabilizes or declin es--is thus urgently needed to ensure longerterm economic growth and stability."
 Preventing a sudden and severe contraction in fiscal policy early next ye ar will support the transition of the economy back to full employment; a stronger economy will in turn reduce the deficit and contribute to achie ving longterm fiscal sustaina bility.
" At the same time, a credible plan to put the fede ral budget on a path th at will be sustainable in the long run could help keep longerterm interest rates low and boost household and business confidence, thereby supporti ng economic growth today."
  - 13 -Monetary Policy  Let me now turn briefl y to monetary policy.
Monetary policy can do little to reverse the effects that the financial crisis may have had on the economy’s productive potential.
" As you know, the Federal Reserve took strong easing measur es during the financial crisis and recession, cutting its target for the fede ral funds rate--the traditional tool of monetary policy--to nearly zero by the end of 2008."
" Since that  time, we have provided additional accommodation through two nontraditional polic y tools aimed at putting downward pressure on longerterm interest rates:  asse t purchases that reduce the supply of longerterm securities outstanding in the market, a nd communication about th e future path of monetary policy."
"Most recently, after the September FO MC meeting, we announced that the Federal Reserve would purchase additional agency mortgagebacked securities (MBS) and continue with the program to extend the maturity of our Treasury holdings.10  These additional asset purchases s hould put downward pressure on longerterm interest rates and make broader financial conditions more accommodative.11  Moreover, our purchases                                                  10 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2012), “Federal Reserve Issues FOMC Statement,” press release, September 13, www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20120913a.htm."
" An increase in our asset purchases may also act as a signal that we intend to pursue a persistently more accommodative polic y stance than prev iously thought, thereby lowering investors’ expectations for the future  path of the federal funds rate and putting additional downward pressure on longerterm interest rates."

"   - 15 -pushing the expected period of low rates further into the future, we are not saying that we expect the economy to remain weak until mid20 15; rather, we expect --as we indicated in our September statement--that a highly accomm odative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable tim e after the economic recovery strengthens.13  In other words, we will want to be sure that the recovery is established before we begin to normalize policy."
" We hope that such assura nces will reduce uncertainty and increase confidence among households and businesses,  thereby providing additional support for economic growth and job creation."
" As I have said before, however, while monetary policy can help support the economic recovery, it is by no means a panacea for our economic ills."
