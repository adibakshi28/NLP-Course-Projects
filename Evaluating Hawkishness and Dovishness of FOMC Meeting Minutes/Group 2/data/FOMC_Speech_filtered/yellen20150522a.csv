" The unemployment rate hit 10 percent nationally, and it reached 11.3  percent here in Rhode Island."
" Nationally, payrolls shrank by some 81/2 million, about 6 percent, and the 41,000 jobs lost in Rhode Island represented close to 8 percent of the state’s employment ."
" U.S. e conomic output fell more than 4 percent nationally, the most since the Great Depression,  and many of the hardest -hit industries ,  - 2 - including housing construction and manufacturing, are important to the Rhode Island economy.1  The Federal Reserve took action to help stabilize the financial system during the crisis, and we have supported the economic recovery with monetary policy actions designed to hold down longer -term interest rates."
 The unemployment rate has come down steadily to 5.4 percent in April.
" Rhode Island’s unemployment rate improved very slowly during the recovery , and, for a time, it was the highest of any state."
" Th e jobless  rate has come down a lot over the past year or so, but at 6.3 percent in March, unemployment here remains above the national average, and payroll employment has yet to regain its pre -recession  peak."
 The unemployment ra te has come down close to levels that many economists believe is sustainable in the long run without generating inflation.
 But the unemployment rate today probably does not fully capture the extent of slack in the labor market.
" Finally, the generally disappointing pace of wage growth also suggests that the labor market has not fully healed."
" Nationally, there are at least some encouraging signs of a pickup so far this year.2  The fact that some large companies, such as Wal -Mart 2 According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics ’ (BLS) employment cost index --which measures both wages and the cost of employer -provided benefits --hourly compensation in private industry rose 2 -3/4 percent over the year ended in March after having averaged gains of about 2 percent per year during most of t he recovery."
 This improvement in the labor market has brought the economy closer to one of the two goals of monetary policy assigned to the Fed by the Congress --maximum employment.
 Consumer price inflation remains below the Fed’s stated objective of 2 percent.
" The notion that inflation can be too low may sound odd, but over time low inflation means that wages as well as prices will rise by less, and very low inflation can impair the functioning of the economy --for example, by making it more difficult for households and firms to pay off their debts."
" Overall consumer price inflation has been especially low --close to zero --over the past year, a s the big fall in oil prices since last summer lowered prices for gasoline, heating oil, and other energy products."
" But inflation excluding food and energy, which is often a better indicator of where overall inflation will be in the future, has also been low, below the Fed’s 2 percent objective both now and for almost all of the economic recovery ."
" Inflation has been held down by the continued economic weakness during the slow recovery and , more recently, by lower prices of imported goods as well as the fall in oil prices."
" With oil prices no longer declining, and with the public’s expectations of future inflation apparently stable, my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) and I believe that consumer price inflation will move up to 2 percent as the economy strengthens further and as other temporary factors weighing on inflation recede."
" A second headwind, also quite important here in Rhode Island, has come from changes in fiscal policy  to reduce budget deficits ."
"                                                   - 6 - of 2008 and 2009 supported economic output , but the ef fects of that stimulus faded ; by 2011, federal fiscal policy actions became a drag on output growth when the recovery was still weak ."
" Overall, fiscal policy actions at both the federal and the state and local levels look like they are no longer a significant drag on economic growth."
" However, growth in many other parts of the global economy, including China and some other emerging market economies, has slowed."
" Weak growth abroad, together with its accompanying implications for exchange rates , has dented U.S. exports and weighed on our economy."
" This headwind too should abate as growth in the global economy firms, supported by monetary policies that generally remain highly accommodative."
"    Factors A ffecting the O utlook  With the waning of the headwinds that I have discussed, the U.S. economy seems well positioned for continued growth."
" If confirmed by further estimates, my guess is that this apparent slowdown was largely the result of a variety of transitory factors that occurred at the same time , includ ing the unusually cold and snowy winter and the labor disputes at ports on the West Coast, both of which likely  disrupted some economic activity."
"  All of that said, the headwinds facing our eco nomy have not fully abated, and, as such, I expect that continued growth in employment and output will be moderate over the remainder of the year and beyond."
" I mentioned the ongoing issues with mortgage credit, but more generally, many years of a weak job market and slow wage gains seem to have induced many people to double -up on housing, and many young adults  continue to l ive with their parents."
" Population growth is creating a need for more  housing, whether to rent or to own, and I do expect that continuing job and wage gains will encourage  more people to form new  households ."
"  - 9 - Putting it all together, the economic projections of most members of the F OMC  call for  growth in real gross domestic product  of roughly 21/2 percent per year over the next couple of years, a little faster than the pace of  the recovery thus far, with the unemployment rate continuing to move down to near  5 percent by the end of this year."
" And for inflation, as I noted earlier, my colleagues and I expect inflation to move up toward our objective of 2 percent as the economy strengthens further and as transitory influences wane."
" For many reasons, output and job growth over the next few years could prove to be stronger , and inflation higher , than I expect; correspondingly, employment could grow more slowly , and inflation could remain undesirably low."
"  Implications for M onetary P olicy  Given this economic outlook and the attendant uncertainty, how is monetary policy likely to evolve over the next few years?"
" Because of the substantial lags in the effects of monetary policy on the economy, we must make policy in a forwardlooking manner."
 Delaying action to tighten monetary policy until employment and inflation are already back to our objectives would risk overheating the economy.
"  For this reason, if the economy continues to improve as I expect, I think it will be appropriat e at some point this year to take the initial step to raise the federal funds rate target and begin the process of normalizing monetary policy."
" To support taking this step,  - 10 - however, I will need to see continued improvement in labor market conditions, and I will need to be reasonably confident that inflation will move back to 2 percent over the medium term."
" If conditions develop as my colleagues and I expect, then the FOMC’s objectives of maximum employment and price stability would best be achieved by proceeding cautiously, which I expect would mean that it will be several years before the federal funds rate would be back to its normal, longer -run level."
" Rather, we will adjust monetary policy in response to deve lopments in economic activity and inflation as they occur."
" If conditions improve more rapidly than expected, it may be appropriate to raise interest rates more quickly; conversely, the pace of normalization may be slower if conditions turn out to be less favorable."
" The Federal Reserve’s objectives of maximum employment and price stability do not, by themselves, ensure a strong pace of economic growth or an improve ment in living standards."
" The most important factor determining living standards is productivity  - 11 - growth, defined as increases in how much can be produced in an hour of work."
" Over time, sustained increases in productivity are necessary to support rising i ncomes."
 The growth rate of output per hour worked in the business sector has averaged about 1 -1/4 percent per year since the recession began in late 2007.
" I have mentioned the tepid pace of wage gains in recent years, and while I do take this as evidence of slack in the labor market, it also may be a reflection of relatively weak productivity growth."
" Productivity depends on many f actors, including our workforce’s knowledge and skills and the quantity and quality of the capital, technology, and infrastructure that they have to work with."
 Economists debate how optimistic to be about our nation’s productivity prospects.
" Others are more optimistic, suggesting that recent technological in novation remains as impressive as ever, and that history shows it may take some years to fully reap the economic benefits of such innovations.7  I do not know who is right, but I do believe that, as a nation, we should be pursuing policies to 7 For a relatively pessimistic view of productivity growth because “the low -hanging fruit is picked ,” see Robert J."

" It also is possible that a portion of the relatively we ak productivity growth we have seen recently may be the result of the recession itself.8  Firms slashed their capital expenditures during the recession, and as I noted earlier, the increases in investment during the recovery have been modest."
" As the economy strengthens further, many of these processes could work in reverse, boosting our productivity prospects."
" To the extent this is so, Federal Reserve actions to strengthen the recovery may not only help bring our economy back to its productive potential, but it may also support the growth of productivity and living standards over the longer run."
