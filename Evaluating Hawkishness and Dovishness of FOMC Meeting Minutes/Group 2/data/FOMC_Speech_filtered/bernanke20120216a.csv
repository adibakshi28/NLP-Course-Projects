Let me take this opportunity to mention  one concern that is of particular relevance to the Federal Reserve:  A common complaint on the part of  some community banke rs is that very low interest rates hurt their profitability by squeezing net interest margins.
" Since the onset of the financial crisis, t he Federal Reserve ’s monetary policy has been accommodative , as you know ."
  The effects  of the configuration of interest rates on  banks and other financial institutions are certainly  part of the discussion when we strive to determine  the appropriate  monetary policy .
" When loan demand is weak, - 4 -   forcing banks to hold low -return safe assets  instead  of lending , net interest margin s suffer ."
" The purpose of the Federal Reserve’s policy of low interest rates is t o speed the economic recovery , which  will increase loan demand and opportunities for profitable lending , among many other benefits,  and thus, ultimately , lead to higher net interest margins ."
" Putting all these considerations together , in the longer term the overall effect on ba nk profitability  of an appropriately accommodative monetary policy  is almost certainly  positive ."
"  For th e Fed eral Reserve  in particular, community banks not only provide insights into the ir industry, but they are also an unmatched source of crucial grassroots information about developments in the economy as a whole, which is necessary for effective monetary policy."
 This  connection to Main Street  is vitally important to fulfilling both our supervisory and monetary policy responsibilities .
