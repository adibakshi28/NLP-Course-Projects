" Since then, to damp the house price -credit cycle that can lead to a housing crisis, countries worldwide have worked to create or expand exis ting macroprudential policies that would, in principle, limit credit growth and the rate of house price appreciation.16  Most macroprudential policies focus on borrowers ."
" One study conducted across 119 countries from 2000 to 2013 suggests that lower LTV limits lead to slower credit growth.17  In addition, evidence from a range of studies suggests that decreases in the LTV ratio lead to a slowing of the rate of house price appreciation.18                                                   15 See Task Force of the Monetary Policy Committee of the European System of Central Banks (2009 ) and Connor, Flavin, and O’Kelly (2012)."
" In addition, bank capital requirements for mortgages that increase when house prices rise may be u sed to lean against mortgage credit growth and house price appreciation.20  These policies are intended to make bank mortgage lending more expensive, leading borrowers to reduce their demand for credit, which tends to push house prices down."
" Estimates of the effects of such changes vary widely:  After consideration of a range of estimates from the literature, an increase of 50 percentage points in the risk weights on mortgages would result in a house price decrease from as low as 0.6 percent to as high as 4.0 percent.21  These policies are more effective if borrowers are fairly sensitive to a rise in interest rates and if migration of intermediation outside the banking sector to nonbanks is limited."
" So far, research suggests that macroprudential tightening is associated with slower bank credit growth, slower housing credit growth, and less house price                                                  19 See Kuttner and Shim (2016) and International Monetary Fund (2014)."
 21 Based on a range of estimates for banks’ cost of capital and for the elasticity of house prices with respect to interest rates.
" See Adelino, Schoar, and Severino (2012); Glaeser, Gottlieb, and Gyourko (2010); and Rappoport (2016)  for a range of estimates for the elasticity of house prices with respect to interest rates."
" As Atif Mian and Amir Sufi have pointed out, this deterioration in household balance sheets can lead to a substantial drop in consumption and employment.22  Extensive mortgage foreclosures --that is, undertaking the legal process to evict borrowers and repossess the house and then selling the house --as a response to household distress can exacerbate the downturn by imposing substantial dead -weight costs and, as properties are sold, causing house prices to fall further.23   Modifying loans rather than foreclosing on them, including measures such as reducing the  principal balance of a loan or changing the loan terms, can allow borrowers to stay in their homes."
" House prices are now high and rising in several countries, perhaps as a result of extended periods of low interest rates."
