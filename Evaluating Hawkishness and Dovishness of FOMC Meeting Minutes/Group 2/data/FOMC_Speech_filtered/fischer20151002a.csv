"  For release on delivery  1:30 p.m. EDT  October 2, 2015         Macroprudential Policy in the U.S. Economy    Remarks by   Stanley Fischer   Vice Chairman   Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at  “Macroprudential Monetary Policy”  59th Economic Conference of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston  Boston, Massachusetts         October 2, 2015      It is a pleasure to speak at the Federal  Reserve Bank of Bo ston’s annual conference , and I am grateful to President Rosengren and the organi zers for inviting me."
" 5 Recent research has examined the potential benefits and costs ass ociated with the growth and complexity of the financial system, including Cecchetti and Kharroubi (2012), Philippon and Reshef (2012), and Zingales (2015)."
" The proposals would require funds to disclose to the SEC and the public more information about their borrowing, usage, and terms of derivatives and repurchase agreements, securities lendi ng activity, and sensitivity to interest rates."
  - 7 -  notable growth in mortgage originations at independent mortgage companie s as reflected in the striking increase in the share of home -purchase originations by independent mortgage companies fro m 35  percent in 2010 to 47 percent in 2014.
"  This growth coincides with the timing of Basel III, stress testing , and  banks’ renewed appreciation of the legal risks in mortgage originations .12  As another example, t here have also been many report s of diminished liquidity in fixed -income markets ."
"  Implications for monetary policy  Though I remain concerned that the U.S. macroprudential toolkit is not large and not yet battle  tested , that does not imply that  I see acute risks to financial stability in the near term ."
" Indeed, b anks are well capitalized and have sizable liquidity buffers , the housing market is not overheated, and borrowing by households and businesses  has only begun to pick  up after years of de cline or very slow growth."
" Nonetheless, the  limited macroprudential toolkit in the United States  leads me to conclude that there may be times when adjustments in monetary policy should be discussed as a means to curb risks to financial stability."
 The deployment of monetary policy  comes  with significant costs .
" A more restrictive monetary policy would, all else being equal, lead to deviations from price stability and full employment."
" Moreover, financial stability considerations can sometimes point to the need for accommodative monetary policy."
" For example, the accommodative U.S. monetary policy since 2008 has  helped repair the balance sheets of households, nonfinancial firms, and the financial sector."
"  Given  these considerations, how should monetary policy be deployed to foster financ ial stability?"
" This topic is a matter for further research, some of which will look similar to the analysis in an earlier time of whether and how monetary policy should react to rapidly rising asset prices."
" That discussion reached the conclusion that monetary policy should be deployed to deal with errant asset price s (assuming , of course , that they could be identified) only to the extent that not  doing so would result in a worse  outcome for current and future output and inflation.16   There are some calculations --for example , by Lars Svensson-- that suggest it would hardly ever make sense to deploy monetary policy to deal with potential financial instability."
" I                                                     16 For more information on monetary policy and financial stability, see Svensson (2015)."
 I also struggle in trying to find consistency between the certainty  that many have that higher interest rates would have prevented the G lobal  Financial Crisis and the view that the  interest rate should not be used to deal with potential financial instabilities.
 Perhaps that problem can be solved by seeking to distinguish between a situation in which the  interest rate is not at its short -run natural rate and one in which asset -pricing problems are sector  specific.
" It also seems likely that monetary policy should be used for macroprudential purposes  with an eye to the tradeoffs between reduced financial imbalances, price stability, and maximum employment."
" In this regard, a number of recent research papers have begun to frame the issue in terms of such tradeoffs, although this is a new area that deserves further research .17   It may also be fruitful for researchers to continue investigating the deployment  of new or little -used monetary policy tools."
" For example, it is arguable that reserve requirements --a traditional monetary policy instrument --can be  viewed as a macroprudential tool ."
" Given these challenges, we need to consider the potential role of monetary policy in fostering financial stability  while recognizing that there is more research to be done in clarifying the potenti al costs and benefits of doing so when conditions appear so to warrant ."
