 This kind of comprehensive outreach on monetary policy is ne w for the Fed.
" For many decades, t here was a sense at the Board that the public wasn’t interested or willing to dive into the complexities of monetary policy."
" When we communicate our views on the economic outlook and our expectations  for where interest rates may be heading, consumers and businesses take that information into account when making decisions on spending, investment, and hiring."
" We want to hear from people , from different parts of the country and different sectors of the economy, about how monetary policy affects them and their communities."
" And, hearing a broad range of perspectives on these issues will help us make good decisions as we consider new approaches to monetary policy."
" I come fr om a background in farm ing and ranching, so, naturally, I am interested in hearing the St. Louis Fed’s Agriculture Industry Council’s priorities for the monetary policy review."
" I want to know, for example, how monetary policy affects rural communities, like the one I come f rom in Kansas, but I also want to know how it affects urban communities."

" Given that, it would be helpful to hear from you whether you think the Federal Open Market Committee should consider strategies that aim to have inflation exceed our target for a time, to make up for the earlier period of time when it f ell short ."
 Or would that threaten the decades of success the Fed has had keeping the public’s expectations for inflation low and stable?
 A related question concerns the Fed’s existing toolkit  for monetary policy.
" Currently, our policy levers include  setting interest rates, adjusting the size and composition of our balance sheet,  and communicating the expected future path of policy."
" Your perspective s on questions like these are a vital part o f this monetary policy review , so I want to thank you, again, for your time and your contribution."
