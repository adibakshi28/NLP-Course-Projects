"E DT September 26, 2017 Inflation, Uncertainty, and Monetary Policy Remarks by Janet L."
"Yellen  Chair Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System  at “Prospects for Growth:  Reassessing the Fundamentals”  59th Annual Meeting of the National Association  for Business Economics Cleveland, Ohio September 26, 2017  I would like to thank the National Association for Business Economics for inviting me to speak today and for the vital role the association plays in fostering debate on important economic policy questions."
"  Today I will discuss uncertainty and monetary po licy, particularly as it relates to recent inflation developments."
" Because changes in interest rates influence economic activity and inflation with a substantial lag, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) sets monetary policy with an eye to its effects on the outlook for the economy."
" Key among current  uncertainties  are the forces driving inflation , which has remained low in recent years despite substantial improvement in labor market conditions ."
" As I will discuss, this low inflation likely reflects factors whose influence should fade over time."
" But as I will also discuss, many uncertainties attend  this assessment, and downward pressures on inflation could prove to be unexpectedly persistent."
" My colleagues and I may have misjudged the strength of the labor market, the degree to which longer -run inflation expectations are consistent with our inflati on objective, or even the fundamental forces driving inflation."
" In interpreting incoming data, we will need to stay alert to these possibilities and, in light of incoming information, adjust our views about inflation, the overall economy, and the stance o f monetary policy best suited to promoting maximum employment and price stability."
  Recent I nflatio n Developments and the O utlook  Let me begin by reviewing recent inflation developments and the economic outlook.
" As the solid blue line in figure 1 indicates, i nflation  as measured by the price  - 2 - index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) has generally run below the FOMC’s 2 percent longer -run objective since that goal  was announced  in January 2012.1  Core inflation, which strips out volatile foo d and energy prices, has also fallen persistently short of 2 percent (the red dashed line)."
" Furthermore, both overall and core inflation, after moving up appreciably l ast year, have slipped  again  in recent months ."
" Sustained low inflation such as this is undesirable because, among other things, it generally leads to low settings of the federal funds rate in normal times, thereby providing less scope to ease monetary policy to fight recessions."
" In addition, a persistent  undershoot of our stated 2 percent goal could undermine the FOMC’s credibility, causing inflation expectations  to drift and actual inflation and economic activity to become more volatile."
"  As noted in its recent statement, t he FOMC continues to anticipate that, with gradual adjustments in t he stance of monetary policy, inflation will rise and  stabilize at around 2 percent over the medium term ."
" This expectation is illustrated by the green stars, which represent the medians of the inflation projections submitted by FOMC participants at our me eting last week."
" As shown in figure 2, t he unemployment rate (the blue line) now stands at 4.4 percent, somewhat below the median of FOMC participants’ estimates of its longerrun sustainable level  (the black line)."
" The inflation outlook also reflects the Committee’s judgment that inflation expectations will remain reasonably well anchored at a level consisten t with PCE price inflation of 2 percent in the long run, and that the restraint imposed in recent years by a variety of                                                  1 The Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy  is available on the Board’s website at www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_LongerRunGoals.pdf ."
"  To understand this  assessment , it is useful to decompose the forces driving movements in inflation since the financial crisis, as estimated using a simple model of inflation  that I prese nted in a speech two years ago .2  Figure 3 reports this decomposition as the contributions made by various factors to the shortfall of PCE price inflation from 2 percent , year by year ."
" This year, however, inflation has been unexpectedly weak from the model’s perspective."
" This unusually large error does not necessarily imply that inflation is more  likely to                                                  2 The simple model links the current rate of inflation t o several factors, including lagged inflation, long -run inflation expectations, labor utilization, and changes in the relative prices of food, energy and imports  (Yellen, 2015)."
"     3 In the decomposition procedure, movements in core inflation affect headline inflation one -forone; as a result, the contributions of food and energy price inflatio n are defined as each component’ s price change relative to the core, weighted by its share in total n ominal consumer spe nding."
"  The estimated contribution of movements in import prices is also computed relative to core inflation; thus, if import prices are rising at the same rate as core inflation, they have no estimated effect on the shortfall of overall  inflation from 2 percent."
" In addition, the decomposition takes account of lags in the adjustment of core inflation to movements in resource utilization and other factors."
"  - 4 - continue to come in on the low  side in coming years .4  Some of the recent decline in  inflation , although not all, reflects  idiosyncratic  shifts  in the prices of some items, such as the large decline in telecommunic ation service  price s seen earlier in the year, that are unlikely to be repeated."
" As the green  dashed line in figure 4 illustrates, if  the average change in consumer prices each month is calculated excluding items whose price changes are outlie rs on both the high and low side, the resulting “trimmed mean” measure of inflation shows less of a slowdown this year .5   Based on analyses of this sort, my colleagues and I currently think that this year’s low inflation is probably temporary, so we conti nue to anticipate that inflation is likely to stabilize around 2 percent over the next few years."
" But our understanding of the forces driving inflation is imperfect, and we recognize that something more persistent may be responsible for the current unders hooting of our longer -run objective."
" Uncertainty about the I nflation Outlook  Although we judge that inflation will  most likely stabilize aroun d 2 percent over the next few years, the odds that it could turn out to be noticeably different are considerable."
" Here the red line indicates the median                                                  4 In the  simple model, inflation depends in part on lagged inflation."
" As a result, an unexplained movement in inflation is predicted to influence inflation beyond the current quarter, but to a degree that fades over time."
" For this reason, the FOMC usually focuses on the growth rate of PCE prices over the previous 12 months, which smooths through the vola tility in the monthly price data."
" That said, 12month rates of inflation will continue to be held down through early 2018 by the unusually weak monthly  readings on price changes recorded in early 2017."
   - 5 - of the latest inflation projections submitted by FOMC participants that I showed previously.
 T he width of this region reflects the average accuracy of inflation projections made by private and government forecasters over the past 20 years.
" As the figure shows, based on that history, there is a 30 percent probability that inflation could  be greater than 3 percent or less than 1 percent next year .6   Most of this uncertainty reflects the influence of unexpected movements in oil prices and the foreign exchange value of the dollar , as well as that of idiosyncratic developments unrelated to broader economic conditions."
 These factors could easily push overall inflation noticeably above or below 2 perce nt for a time.
" But such disturbances are not a great concern from a policy perspe ctive because their effects fade away as long as inflation expectations remain anchored.7  For this reason, the FOMC strives to look through these transitory inflation effects when setting monetary policy."
 Such was the case when rising oil prices pushed headline inflation noticeably above 2 percent for several years prior to the financial crisis .
" Similarly, the Committee substantially discounted the reductions in inflation that occurred from 2014 through 2016 as a result of the decline in oil prices and the effects of the dollar’s appreciation on import prices ."
A mo re important issue from a policy standpoint  is that some key assumptions underlying the baseline outlook could be wrong in ways that imply that inflation will remain low for longer than currently projected.
" 7 This statement abstracts from any persistent effects such disturbances might have on real activity, wh ich could have implications for monetary policy."
"  - 6 - may not be as tight as they appear to be, and thus they may exert less upward pressure on inflation than anticipated."
" Alternatively, long -run inflation expectations , which have an important influence on actual inflation, may not be consistent with the FOMC’s 2 perce nt goal."
" More broadly, the conventional framework for understanding inflation dynamics could be misspecified in some fundamental way."
  Resource U tilization  The unemployment rate consistent with long -run price stability at any time is not known with certainty; we can only estimate it.
 The median of the longer -run unemployment rate projections submitted by FOMC pa rticipants last week is around 41/2 percent .
" But the longrun sustainable unemployment  rate can drift over time because of demographic changes and other factors, some of which can be difficult to quantify--or even identify --in real time.8  For these and other reasons, the statistical precision of such estimates is limited, and the actual  value of the sustainable rate could well be noticeably lower than currently projected.9  Thus, although FOMC participants generally view current labor utilization as probably somewhat greater than what can be sustained in the longer run, the statistical evidence from past experience does not rule out                                                  8 For example, Aaronson and others (2015) estimate that increases in the average age  and educational attainment  of U.S. workers will reduce the sustainable rate of unemployment almost 1/2 percentage point between 2014 and 2020."
 Barnichon and Mesters (2017) also present evidence that demographic changes have somewhat reduced the structural unemployment rate in the United States in recent years.
"  Relatedly, Yoon, Kim, and Lee (2014) and Juselius and Takats (20 15) estimate that ongoing demographic transitions are having modest disinflationary effects in the United States and other developed economies."
 9 The statistical evidence also suggests that the sustainable rate of unemployment could be higher.
" As illustra ted by the results reported in Reifschneider, Wascher, and Wilcox (2015) and Barnichon and Matthes (2017), standard errors for estimates of the sustainable rate of unemployment are typically at least 1/2 percentage point."
" If so, the economy could sustain a higher level of employment and output in the longer run than now anticipated--a very beneficial outcome, a lbeit one that would require recalibrating monetary policy over time in order to reap those benefits and compensate for the accompanying reduction in inflationary pressures."
 A related question is whether the unemployment rate alone is an adequate gauge of economic slack for the purposes of explaining inflation.
" Although the unemployment rate is probably the best single summary measure of labor utilization, some indicators have shown less improvement since the financial crisis.10  As the solid blue line in figure 6 illustrates,  the employed share of the “prime -age worker” population-- that is, persons from age s 25 to 54-- remains noticeably below the 2007 level.11  But employment rates for this group may now be permanently lower than in the past as a result of declining employment opportunities for less -skilled workers, a rising number of people receiving disability  insurance, and other worrisome  trends.12  Similarly, although the share of part -time workers who would like a full -time job is still somewhat above wh ere it stood                                                  10 Several years ago, I discussed the int erpretation of a wide range of labor market indicators at length (Yellen, 2014)."
" 11 The employment -topopulation ratio for all persons aged 16 and over has recovered much less than the prime -age ratio since 2007, in large part reflecting the ongoing retirem ent of the baby boomers and a rise in school attendance rates for young adults aged 20 to 24 (Aaronson and others, 2014)."
 Schanzenbach and others (2017) estimate that the substantial overall employment -topopulation gap that opened up in the wake of the f inancial crisis finally closed in July 2017.
  Evidence suggests that a portion of the decline is attributable to a reduction in the demand for low -skilled workers result ing from advances in technology and globalization .
" Relatedly, an alarming  deterioration in health outcomes  among low -education workers , including a rise in deaths related to alcohol, drugs, and suicide , may be having an a dverse effect on both male and female employment (Case and Deaton, 2017)."
"  On balance, the unemployment rate probably is correct in signaling that overall labor market conditions have returned to pre -crisis levels."
" But that return does not necessarily demonstrate that the economy is now at maximum employment because, due to demographic and other structural changes, the unemployment rate that is sustainable today may be lower than the rate that was sustainable in the past ."
"  In that regard, s ome o bservers have pointed to the  continued subdued pace of wage growth as evidence that the economy is not yet back to full employment."
" But growth in average hourly earnings (the solid blue line) and the Atlanta Fed’s Wage Growth Tracker (the longdashed black line) have clearly picked up.14  In addition, productivity                                                  13 For a discussion of how secular forces may be influencing the trend share of part -time employment, see Valletta and van der List (2015)."
"  14 In contrast to the other wage and compensation measures, the Wage Growth Tracker only measures wage changes for individuals who had a job in both the current month and a year ago."
"  - 9 - growth has been quite weak in recent years, and empirical analysis sugges ts that it is has been holding down aggregate growth in labor compensation independent of labor utilization in recent years.15  An analysis of the pattern of wage growth at the U.S. state level also suggests that subdued growth for the country as a whole pr obably reflects sluggish productivity or some other factor common to all states, because crossstate differences in wage growth are about what one would expect given cross -state differences in unemployment rates.16  Finally, I would note that the percentage  of firms planning wage increases has moved back up to its prerecession level, many firms report  difficulties in finding qualified workers, and some have r esponded by expanding training programs and offering signing bonuses --possible  harbi ngers of stronge r wage gains to come ."
" That said, the evidence does not allow for any definitive assessment, so  policymakers must remain  open minded on this question and its implications for reaching our inflation goal."
 Inflation Expectations  Another source of uncertainty concerns inflation expectations.
" In standard economic models, inflation expectations are an important determinant of actual inflation because, in deciding how much to adjust wages for individual jobs and prices of goods                                                  15 For example, predictions from a simple empirical model track recent movem ents in the employment cost index reasonably well, because the model estimates that the increasing upward pressure on compensation growth from rising labor utilization is being offset by a declining contribution from productivity growth."
" (See the appendix for further details.)  Relatedly, research also suggests that cyclical changes in the composition of the workforce associated with the absorption of new workers with relatively low skills and experience may be  currently restraining growth in both aggregat e wages and productivity."
"See Daly and Hobijn (2017) and Daly, Hobijn, and Pyle (2016), who  also point to the retirement  of baby boomers as a factor holding down wage growth."
"   - 10 - and s ervices at a particular time, firms take into account the rate of overall inflation they expect to prevail in the future."
" Monetary policy presumably plays a key role in shaping these expectations by influencing the average rate of inflation experienced in the past over long periods of time, as well as by providing guidance about the FOMC’s objectives for inflation in the future."
" Even so, economists’ understanding of exactly how and why inflation expectations change over time is limited.17  Moreover, we have to contend with the fact that we do not directly observe the inflation expectations relevant to wage and price setting ."
 The FOMC’s outlook depends importantly on the view that longer -run inflation expectations have been stable for many years at a level consistent with PCE price inflation that will average around 2 percent in the longer run .
" Provided this stability continues, standard models sugge st that actual inflation should stabilize at about 2 percent over the next two or three years in an environment of roughly full employment, absent any future shocks."
" However, there is a risk that inflation expectations may not be as well anchored as they appear and perhaps are not consistent with our 2 percent goal ."
" To assess this risk, the FOMC con siders a variety of survey me asures of expected longer -run inflation, some of which are shown in f igure 9."
" Longrange projections of PCE price inflation made by private forecasters, the solid red line, have been remarkably stable for many years, as have been the longer -run inflation expectations reported in surveys of                                                  17 As I discussed in a speech one year ago, I view expectations formation as one of the key areas requiring further research by economists (see Yellen, 2016)."
" If so, stabilizing inflation at around 2 percent could prove to be more difficult than expected.20 In theory, differences between yields on conventional Treasury sec urities and those on Treasury I nflation -Protected S ecurities (TIP S) are also informative about inflation expectations in that they measure the compensation received by investors for exposing themselves to future changes in consumer prices."
" As indicated by  the long -dashed green line, TIPS inflation compensation for the fiveyear period starting five years from now has fallen roughly 1 percentage point over the past three years."
" This decline                                                  18 In the Survey of Primary Dealers conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the median of  respondents’ longer -term projections for PCE inflation have been essentially flat at 2 percent since the survey began in 2011."
" Similarly, in the Blue Chip Financial Indicators survey, which solicits the views of a large number of financial firms  (as well  as a few other institutions) about the extended outlook every June and December, the median of long -run expectations for GDP price inflation has stayed close to 2.1  percent over the past six years."
" For example, some surveys include the low rates of inflation expected over the next few years in the calculation of projected longer -run averages, while other surveys exclude them."
" 19 Expected inflation over the next 5 to 10 years as reported in the Michigan survey runs appreciably above PCE price inflation on average since the mid -1990s, perhaps because hou seholds are less informed about actual inflation developments than professional forecasters and financial firms."
"  20 In addition to monitoring survey measures of expected inflation, Federal Reserve staff also use statistical techniques to try to directly estimate possible movements over time in the underlying longrun trend in inflation, using data for actual inflation and other series, including resour ce utilization."
 Many of these statistical estimates suggest that the underlying trend in PCE inflation is currently somewhat below 2 percent.
" Econometrically, however, it is extremely difficult if not impossible to disentangle estimates of the underlying  trend in PCE inflation from estimates of the sustainable rate of unemployment."
" To be consistent with the data, the higher one’s estimate of trend inflation or expected long -run inflation, the lower must be one’s estimate of the sustainable unemployment r ate, at least over the medium run."
  - 12 - could be interpreted as a significant drop in market participants’ expectations for the most  likely outcome for inflation in the longer run .
" However, research suggests that the fall in TIPS inflation compensation instead primarily reflects a decline in inflation risk premiums and differences in the liquidity of nominal and indexed Treasury securities.21  This research notwithstanding, the notable decline in inflation compensation may be a sign that longer -term inflation expectations have slipped recently."
" Misspecified I nflation Dynamics  Another risk is that our framework for understanding inflation dynamics could be misspecified in some fundamental way , perhaps becau se our econometric models overlook some factor that will restrain inflation in coming years  despite solid labor market conditions."
 One possibility in this vei n is a continuation of the subdued growth in health -care prices that we have seen in recent years-- a sector -specific factor not controlled for in standard models .
" Because health care accounts for a large share of total consumer spending, this slow growth  has restrained overall inflation materially and may continue to do so for some time .22  A similar situation occurred during the 1990s, when a significant shift in health insurance enrollment away from fee -forservice and toward HMO (that is, Health Maintena nce Organization) plans reduced cost pressures and held                                                  21 For example, Andreasen and Christensen (2016) show that once TIPS liquidity premium s are taken into account, the model -implied one -year inflation expectation becomes more stable and shows a smaller decline since 2013."
" In addition, quotes on inflation derivatives suggest that most of the decline in inflation compensation over this period is associated with investor perceptions of reduced risks of above -target inflation outcomes rather than increased risks of below -target  inflation outcomes."
   - 13 - down overall inflation for several years.
" If these sorts of favorable supplytype shocks  continue, achieving our 2 percent inflation goal over the medium term may require a more accommodative  stance of monetary policy than might otherwise be appropriate."
" Some commentators have conjectured that, because of rising trade volumes and the integration of production chains across countries, U.S. inflation now depends on global resource utilization, not just  on conditions here at home  and those effects arising through movements in energy and import prices ."
" However, studies of this issue do not, on balance, provide much empirical support for this possibility.23  Moreover, foreign economic growth has firmed thi s year and the global economy appears to have largely recovered, so any influence that global resource utilization might have on U.S. inflation would presumably be small."
" In fact, one  study concludes that most  of the decline in the labor share of national income in the United States since the late 1980s can be attributed to offshoring of labor -intensive production.24  If this restraint on the labor share continues to build over                                                  23 In an early study, Borio and Filardo (2007) reported results suggesting that global economic slack adds considerable explanatory power to reduced -form inflation equations  (such as the one discussed in the appendix) , and that its role has been growing over time."
 Federal Reserve Board staff have updated this a nalysis using data through early 2017 and confirmed  that global slack does not appear to exert an appreciable direct effect on domestic inflation in the United States and most other advanced economie s.
"  - 14 - the next few years (and not merely  holds  steady), then it could indirectly hold down the growth of domestic wages and prices in ways not captured by conventional models."
"  More speculatively, changes in the structure of the domestic economy may also be altering inflation dynamics in ways not captured by conventional models."
" The growing importance of online shopping, by increasing the competitiveness of the U.S. retail sector, may have reduced price margins and restrained the ability of firms to raise prices in response to rising demand.25  That said, the economy overall appears to have become more concentrated and less dynamic in r ecent years, which  may tend to increase  firms’ pricing power.26  Because these changes occur  slow ly, determining their complex effects on the economy will, as a pra ctical matter, require studying data over a considerable time."
"  Finally, I would note the possibility that inflation may rise more sharply in response to robust labor market conditions than anticipated."
" The influence of labor utilization on inflation has  become quite modest over the past 20 years, implying that the inflationary consequences of misjudging the sustainable rate of unemployment are low."
" Although the evidence is weak that inflation responds in a nonlinear manner to resource utilization, this risk is one that we cannot entirely dismiss."
"                                                  25 For more on the inflation implications of innovation in the retail sector, see Curran and Jamrisko (2017) and Trainer (2016)."
" In this spirit, FOMC participants --like private forecast ers--have reduced their estimates of the sustainable unemployment rate appreciably over the past few years in response to the continual flow of information about the always  changing economy.27  To the extent these assessments change over time, so too will t he outlook and judgments about the appropriate stance of monetary policy."
" Importantly, even if resource utilization is currently lower than we estimate or if longerrun in flation expectations are running at level s consistent with longer -run PCE price  inflation  somewhat below 2 percent , the FOMC can still  achieve its inflation goal."
" Under those conditions, continuing to revise our assessments in response to incoming data would naturally result in a policy path that is somewhat easier than that now anticipa ted--an appropriate course correction that would reflect our commitment to maximum employment and price stability."
" Similar considerations apply to other important sources of uncertainty, such as the value of the neutral real interest rate --that is, the inf lation -adjusted level of t he federal funds rate consistent with keeping the economy operating on an even keel."
" But the neutral rate changes over time as a result of the interaction of many forces, including demographics, productivity growth, fiscal                                                  27 The median of FOMC participants’ projections of the longer -run unemployment rate has declined almost a full percentage point over the past five years; the revision in the long -run consensus forecast reported in the Blue Chip  Survey between October 2012 and March 2017 was slightly larger."
"  - 16 - policy, and the strength of global demand, so its value at any point in time cannot be estimated or projected with much precision."
" A gradual approach is particul arly appropriate in light of subdued inflation and a low neutral real interest rate, which imply that the FOMC will have only limited scope to cut the federal funds rate should the economy be hit with an adverse shock .28  But we should also be wary of moving too gradually."
" Thus, without further modest increases in the federal funds rate over time, there is a risk that the labor market could eventually become overheated, potentially creating an inflationary problem down the road that might be difficult to overcome without triggering a recession."
" Pe rsistently easy monetary policy might also eventually lead to increased leverage and other developments , with adverse implications for financial stability."
" For these reasons, and given that monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation with a substantial lag, it would be imprudent to keep monetary policy on hold until inflation is back to 2 percent."
                                                   28 It might be thought that the FOMC could mitigate this problem by raising the federal funds rate higher than might otherwise be called for while the economy continues to expand in order to increase the extent to which interest rates could be cut later should a recession occur.
" But this strategy would be counterproductive, because it would only serve to weaken economic activity and push down inflation before the recession."
"  - 17 - Conclusion To conclude, standard empirical analyses support the FOMC’s outlook that, with gradual adjustments in monetary policy, inflation will st abilize at around the FOMC’s 2 percent objective over the next few years, accompanied by some further strengthening in labor market conditions."
" But the outlook is uncertain, reflecting, among other things , the inherent imprecision in our estimates of labo r utilization, inflation expectations, and other factors."
" As a result, we will need to carefully monitor the incoming data and, as warranted, adjust our assessments of the outlook and the appropriate stance of monetary policy."
" But in making these adjustm ents, our longer -run objectives will remain unchanged--to promote maximum employment and 2 percent inflation."
"     - 18 - Appendix:  PCE Inflation Model, Inflation Decomposition Procedure , and the ECI Growth Equation  PCE Inflation Model  The inflation model used in the decomposition procedure includes two equations :  an identity for the change in the price index for total personal consumption expenditures (PCE) and a simple reduced -form forecasting equation for core PCE  price  inflation ."

" In the case of inflation, the extensions are  consistent with the medians of  Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) participants’ pr ojections for total and core P CE inflation in 2017 that were reported at the press conf erence following the September 2 017 FOMC meeting.31  Similarly, ܭܥܣܮܵ ௧ over the second half of 2017 is de fined to be consistent with the median of FOMC projections for t he 2017:Q4 unemployment rate le ss the CBO’s estimates of the historical pat h of the longrun natural rate."
 - 20 - normal longer -run level of t he unemployment  rate.
" For changes in the price of core imports, t he 2017:H2 extrapolations are based on a regression of th is series on current and lagged changes in exchange rates."
" This approach predicts that core import prices should rise about 41/2 pe rcent at an annual rate in the second half of this year.32  Energy and f ood prices over the second half of 2017 are assumed to  rise at annual rates of 10 percent and 1.6 percent, respectively; these  assumptions (which  take into account published monthly PCE  data through July and published CPI data through August, as well as recent movements in gasoline prices in the wake of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma) ensure that the combined contribution of food and energy prices to inflation in 2017 is consistent with the median difference between FOMC participants’  projections for total and core inflation."
" Finally, nominal spending shares for food, energy, and core imports are assumed t o remain unchanged at their 2017:Q2 levels, and longrun inflation expectations are assumed to remain constant at 2  percent."
" One by one, each explanatory variable of the model is set to zero , and the model is simulated; the resulting difference between actual inflation and its simulated value equals the historical contribution of that                                                  32 The level of core import prices, expressed relative to core consumer prices, displayed a modest downward trend from 1990 through 2001 but since then has displayed little persistent trend, particularly if one controls for shifts related to recent changes in the real exchange rate."
" If the post -2001 pattern persists in coming years, then 𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡 would be expected to converge to zero within a few quarters and core PCE inflation to converge to 2 percent within two or three years, assuming that the unem ployment rate remains near 4 -1/2 percent (the median of the longer -run projections provided by FOMC participants) and there are no further shocks to the exchange rate and other factors."
" If, however, core import prices were expected to resume trending down relative to consumer prices, then the model as specified would imply that the unemployment rate consistent wit h inflation stabilizing at 2 percent in the longer run  would be somewhat lower than 41/2 percent."
" Importantly, the simulations are all dynamic in that the lagged inflation term in the core inflation equation is set equal to its simulated value in the preceding period rather than its actual value."
" As a result, the decompositions incorporate the effects of changes in la gged inflation that are attributable to previous movements in the explanatory variables."

" ( All data used in the model were current as of September  1, 2017.)   34 The estimation procedure imposes the joint restriction that the sum of the coefficients on 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡−1𝑒𝑒 and the lagged ECI growth terms are equal to 1, and that the c oefficients on 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡−1𝑒𝑒 and 𝑅𝑅𝑆𝑆_𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 𝑡𝑡 are equal."

 The model is used to compute a decomposition of ECI growth following a procedure similar to  that used to construct the de composition for core PCE price inflation.
" The table summarizes the results of this decomposition over various periods; note that the column labeled “ Slack” combines the effects of ∆ 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 𝑡𝑡 and 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 𝑡𝑡, the effect of the model’s constant term is included in the column labeled “ Trend productivity,” and the column labeled “ Other” gives the contributions of the model’s tracking errors."
