"For release on delivery  1:15 p.m. EST  (12:15 p.m. CST)   January  19, 2023          Staying the Course  to Bring Inflation Down     Remarks by   Lael Brainard   Vice Chair   Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at the  University  of Chicago Booth School of Business   Chicago , Illinois         January 19, 2023    Inflation has declined in recent months , which is important for American households, businesses, and consumers."
" Inflation is high, and it  will take time  and resolve  to get  it back down to 2 percent ."
" R eal yield s have risen  significantly  across the curve  over the past year :  2year yields on Treasury InflationProtected Securities (TIPS) have risen more than 41/2 percentage points to 2.1 percent, and 10year TIPS yields have risen more than 21/4 percentage points to 1.2 percent."
 Short -term real interest rates have moved into decidedly positive territory.2  Mortgage rates have doubled.3 Inflation has been declining over the past several months  against a back drop of mode rate growth.
" Looking forward, weaker readings on real income,  wealth, and sentiment , along with indicators of spending on services, such as the ISM services index,  point to subdued growth in 2023.4  Real d isposable personal income  declined, on net , at an annual rate of 4."
" 2 For instance, the expected 3 -month T -bill rate is currently 4.7 percent, 1.5 percentage points above the 3month 3.2 percent median projection of the 2023:Q1 annualized total PCE (personal consumption expenditures) inflation rate in the January Blue Chip survey."
" It is published in Statistical Release H.10, “ Foreign Exchange Rates, ” available on the Board ’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h10/current/default.htm ."
"4 The Institute for Supply Management’s s ervices index fell by 6.9 points to contractionary territory at 49.6 in December, reflecting declines in the subindexes for business activity, new orders, and employment."
"  - 2 - suggesting that  recent consumption ha s been supported by running down pandemic savings  and greater reliance on  credit .5  In particular, s avings among low -income households appear to be lower and to have declin ed more rapidly than was previously appreciated.6    The widespread expectation for U.S.  growth to  be below potential over 2022 and 2023 reflect s significant tightening in both fiscal  and monetary policy in an environment of broader global tightening."
" T he expiration of previous  fiscal stimulus imp osed a substantial drag on real U.S. gross domestic product ( GDP ) growth in 2022, whereas fiscal  policy is expected to  make a modest contribution over the next few years, in line with its longer -run average ."
" By contrast, the drag on U.S. growth and employment from monetary policy is likely to increase in 2023  because of  transmission  lags from  the rapid, large swing from accommodation to restraint in 2022."
" From March to December  2022, the Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) undertook a large cumulative tightening  in the stance of monetary policy by raising the policy rate 41/4 percent age points  and shrinking the balance sheet."
"  Although financial conditions adjust immediately to reflect expected and actual changes in monetary policy, the full adjustment of  output, employment , and inflation  occurs with a lag .7  Given the speed and magnitude of the swing in  the stance of   5 Total credit card balances were $1.19 trillion in November, relative to $1.09 trillion in December 2019, and the share of borrowers with consumer loans in delinquency has rebounded to pre -pandemic levels ."
" 7 Romer and Romer (2004) and Gertler and Karadi (2015)  find that it takes about 9 and 12 months, respectively, for monetary policy actions to begin to affect inflation and additional time for that effect to   - 3 - monetary policy, the lagged effects of earlier accommodati on likely offset some of  the initial effects of tighte ning over the cou rse of 2022 , and i t is likely that the full effect on demand, employment , and inflation of the cumulative tighte ning that is in the pipeline still lies ahead ."
"  With that in mind, let’s turn to the implications for the  employment leg of  our dual mandate ."
" In contrast to the slowing of  output growth, l abor markets remained  tight throughout 2022, with layoffs remaining below pre -pandemic levels and the unemployment rate ending the year at 3.5 percent, its historical low ."
"  Recent declines in average weekly hours, temporary -help services, and monthly payrolls growth suggest tentative  signs that  labor demand is cooling."
" Employment at temporary -help services firms —a good leading indicator —peaked  in July 2022 and has been declining since  then , ending the year only slightly above its December 2019 level."
" In contrast, Bauer and Swanson (2022)  find that inflation effects from monetary policy occur much sooner and peak within the first 10 months."

" In addition, recent research suggests that there may have been an acceleration in the maximum effe ct on inflation following the broader use of balance sheet and forward -guidance tools in 2009, bringing the arrival of  that maximum effect from three years to as little as 12 months, though considerable uncertainty surrounds that estimate."
"Foerster  (2022) , “Have Lags in Monetary Policy Transmission Shortened?"
" The continued decline in average weekly hours  is notable because this margin is among the easiest to adjust by firms facing  declin ing demand, especially those who may be reluctant to  undertake  layoffs following the challenges encountered in restoring employment following the pandemic -induced layoffs ."
" In addition, a verage payrolls growth in the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ establishment survey fell from 540,000 jobs per month in the first quarter of 2022 to 250,000 jobs  per month in the fourth quarter."
" On net, the labor force partici pation rate flattened out  over 2022 at a level that is about 1 percentage point lower than pre -pandemic , primarily reflecting an estimated 2.5 million in excess retirements , as well as some impact from long COVID .8  Immigration has also been low  in recent years .9 Despite constrained supply, wages do not appear to be driving inflation in a 1970s -style  wage–price spiral."
 It is true that w ages have grown faster than the  pace consistent with 2 percent inflation and productivity growth.
" It is also true that w ages have grown slower than inflation over the past two years , and that aggregate real wages  8 A discussion of the labor market impact of long COVID can be found in Price (2022) and the references within."
"  Retail mar kups  in a number of sectors have seen material increases in what could be described as  a price–price spiral, whereby final prices  have risen by more than the increases in input prices.11  The compression of these markups as  supply constraints ease,  inventories rise , and demand cools could contribute to disinflationary pressures ."
  There are tentative signs that wage growth is moderating.
 G rowth in average hourly earnings  has softened recently—stepping down to 4.1 percent annualized growth on a 3month basis in December from roughly 4.5  percent on a 6month and 12month basis .
 I will be watching to see whether the employment cost index data at the end of this month show  the deceleration  from the third quarter  continuing into the fourth quarter.
"11 Since the pandemic, significant supply and demand imbalances have coincided with large increases in retail trade margins in several sectors , increases  that have exceed ed the contemporaneous increase in wages paid to the workers  in those sectors."
" For example, since the end of 2019, retail trade margins for food and grocery retailers increased by about 25 percent , outstripping the growth in average hourly earnings for work ers in that sector , which was just under 19 percent."
   - 6 - Let’s now turn to the inflation leg of our dual mandate.
 Inflation has declined  in recent months  from very high levels .
" With the consumer price index  and producer price index now available, t otal PCE (personal consumption expenditures) inflation in December is  likely  to have run at around a 2.3 percent annualized pace on a 3 - and 6month basis, as compared with 5.1 percent  on a 12month basis."
 This deceleration reflects an easing in war -related energy shocks as well as  in core goods inflation :  Energy and core goods each subtracted  nearly threefourths  of 1 percentage point  from  3month annualized total PCE inflation .
 Core PCE inflation is running at a 3.1 percent annualized pace on a 3 -month basis —below its  3.8 percent  reading on a 6 -month basis and 4.5 percent on a 12month basis.
" Within this, recent declines in core goods inflation reflect  a reduction in core import prices,  an easing of supply chains, a restocking of inventories , and cooling demand."
" C ore goods prices are likely to flatten out once earlier large gains reverse, in the absence of new shocks , and overall  core inflation could move up somewhat for a time  as a result."
"    In that regard , housing services inflation remains  stubbornly high at 8.8 percent on a 3month basis —compared with 7.7 percent on a 12month basis ."
" That said, the housing sector  is highly interest  sensitive, and the most recent reading of one national indicator pointed to house price s   - 7 - having declined 2.5 percent over the five  months ending in November .12  Similarly, rents based on new leases are decelerating sharply .13  Although it is currently offset by catch -up in renewing  leases, the decline in rent on new leases will show through to average rent over time, and declines in housing services inflation are expected by the third quarter  of this year .14              In addition, nonhousing services are running at  about 4.4 percent annualized inflation on a 3month basis , similar to their 12month pace."
 There are a range of  views on what it will take  to bring down this component of inflation to pre -pandemic levels .
" Since w ages co nstitute  a significant  fraction of  costs for most firms in nonhousing services , one possible channel is through a  weakening in labor demand ."
" That said , to the extent  that inputs other than wages may  have  been responsible in part for important  price increases  for some  nonhousing service  sectors , an unwinding of these factors could help bring down nonhousing services  inflation ."
"  There is some recent  evidence that the persistent components of inflation in core goods and nonhousing services, particularly  transportation, recreation, and food services and accommodation, have behaved similarly , peak ing around early 2022 and steadily  12 The CoreLogic Home Price Index  peaked in June 2022 and has declined in each month through November  2022."
" 13 The CoreLogic Single -Family Rent Index shows a significant decelerati on over the 7 months ending in November , including negative month over month rent growth in September through November ; see CoreLogic (2023 ), “CoreLogic: US Annual Rent Growth Drops for the Seventh Straight Month in November ,” January 17, https://www.corelogic.com/intelligence/corelogic -usannual -rentgrowth -drops -forthe-seventh -straightmonth- innovember/ ."
"  - 8 - declin ing since then .15  To the extent that the persistent components of these nonhousing services and core goods reflect common factors that are fading, such as pass -through from commodity and supply chain shocks , they are unlikely to be as cyclically persistent , as long as inflation expectations are  well  anchored .16   Of course, a n extended period of high goods and services inflation resulting from a series of demand and supply shocks  associated with the pandemic and the war could lead to a rise in inflation expectations , which would make it much more difficult to bring inflation down.17  Tha t is why i t has been important for monetary policy to take a riskmanagement posture to defend the expectations anchor ."
" And the evidence  from market - and surveybased measures  suggest s that longer -term inflation expectations are well anchored , while yearahead measures have recently declined but remain elevated ."
" For these reasons, i t remains  possible that  a continued moderation in aggregate demand could facilitate  continued easing in  the labor market and reduction in inflation without a significant loss of employment.18    15 See Martín Almuzara, Marek Jarocinski, and Argia Sbordone (2023),  “The Layers of Inflation Persistence,” Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Liberty Street Economics  (blog), January 5, https://libertystreeteconomics."

" While there has been some improvement in the outlook for activity and inflation in Europe, there is uncertainty about the implications of China’s exit from zero COVID for global demand and inflation, especially in commodities."
" Even with the recent moderation, inflation remains high , and policy will need to be sufficiently restrictive for some time to make sure inflation returns to 2 percent on a sustained basis."
