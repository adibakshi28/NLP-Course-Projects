"For release on delivery  4:30 p.m. EDT  October 12, 2015          Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy     Remarks by   Lael Brainard   Member   Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at  “North America’s Place in a Changing World Economy ” 57th National Association for Business Economi cs Annual Meeting   Washington, D.C.         October 12, 2015    The will -theyor-won’t -they drumbeat has grown louder of late."
"  Most notably, the labor market has continued to improve this year, pushing the econ omy closer to full employment."
" While monthly nonfarm payroll employment growth looks to have slowed over the past three months to a 167,000 monthly pace,  so far th is year it has averaged about 200,000."
" With these gains more than sufficient to absorb trend growth in the labor force, they have led to gradual increases in resource utilization."
" At 5.1 percent in Septemb er, the unemployment rate has declined ½ percentage point since December."
 Alternative  broader gauges of unemployment --which include individuals who are  marginally attached to the labor force and employees working part -time for economic reasons --have also shown steady improvement this year.
" Even so, a variety of evidence suggests there may be some distance to go to  achieve full employment."
" Although the unemployment rate is near longer -run norms, other measures of labor utilization are not."
"      Thus, it may be a while further before the participation rate fully reacts to the full amount of improvement in labor market conditions that we have seen thus far , since w age growth has remained low,  - 2 - the share of employees working part time for economic reasons remains a full percentage point above the pre -recession level of around 3 perc ent, despite considerable recent improvement."
" Our main gauges of wage inflation suggest that labor compensation is increasing at a pace of about 2 to 2 -1/4 percent, little different from the rate of increase o ver the past several years."
" Indeed, the lack of wage acceleration is likely one of the key reasons that many Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC ) participants have revised down their estimates of the longer -run level of  the unemployment  rate."
" Most recent ly, a majority of participants moved their estimates below 5 percent.4  By comparison, in September 2012, the central tendency of estimates of the longer -run unemployment rate ranged from 5.2 to 6.0 percent."
" 3 Changes in the structure of labor demand, such as a shift toward occupations or industries characteriz ed by flexible and  parttime hours, may have led to an increase in the equilibrium level of part -time work ."
" If workers combine  two or more par ttime jobs to arrive at a full -time workweek,  parttime employment could be elevated  with average weekly hour s at normal levels ."
" But the logistical costs of multiple job holding make such an outcome unlikely, and in recent years elevated part -time employment has not coincided  with an increase in official estimates of multiple job holding."
"  4 See “Figure 3 .B, Distribution of Participants’ Projections for the Unemployment Rate, 2015 -18 and over the Longer Run ,” in the Summary of Economic Projections , addendum to the minutes of the September 2015 FOMC meeting, released on October 8, 2015 , and available at www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20150917.pdf ."
" Thus, even though equity prices are down this year, continued job growth, lower gas prices, rising house prices and some loosening in consumer credit look likely to support consumer spending over the second half of the year."
" Even so, current levels remain below what would be suggested by fundamentals, such as population  growth."
" While private consumption and investment thus appear to be on reassuringly solid trajectories, growth in government expenditures on goods and services is likely to remain tepid."
" Combined purchases at the federal, state , and local levels rose at a n annual rate of  - 4 - only 1 -1/4 percent in the first half of the year, and modest growth in revenue at the state and local level suggest continued limited gains going forward."
"  To be clear, I do not view the improvement in the labor market as a sufficient statistic for judging the outlook for inflation."
" A variety of econometric estimates would suggest that the classic Phillips curve  influence o f resource utilization on  inflation is , at best , very weak at the moment."
" Overall inflation has been subdued, running persistently below our 2 percent target."
" Assuming energy prices stabilize going forward, as futures markets suggest, then energy should be a neutral or perhaps even a small positive influence on inflation next year."
"  But inflation has  been stubbornly low, even excluding energy prices."
   - 5 - The persistence of the weakness in core price inflation deserves attention.
" Estimates suggest the dollar’s rise will hold down core inflation between 1/4 and 1/2 percentage point this year, restraint that would wane if the dollar stabiliz ed going forward."
"  The outlook for inflation is critical for purposes of assessing progress toward our 2 percent goal, since monetary policy operates with a lag ."
" In this regard,  the gravitational force of  longterm inflation expectations is critically important ."
 Projections from the Survey of Professional Forecasters suggest that longer -run inflation expectations --which appear to be most relevant for predicting future inflation --have remained at 2 percent since the end of 2012 .
" Household  survey s, such as University of  Michigan  Survey s of Consumers ,  - 6 - suggest that households ’ longer -run inflation expectations have remained in a narrow range throughout the crisis and the recovery, although they have stayed in the lower end of that  range over the past year."
" In contrast, market -based measures of inflation compensation,  such as inflation swaps and  the difference between nominal and inflation -indexed Treasury bond yields, ha ve declined noticeably over the past year and a half at longe rterm horizons."
"  Of course, factors  other than inflation expectations, such as changes in liquidity premiums and inflation risk premiums , may be at play."
"  Although the balance of evidence thus suggests that longterm inflation expectations are likely to have remained fairly steady , the risks to the near -term outlook for inflation appear to be tilted to the downside , given the persistently low level of core inflation and the recent decline in longer -run inflation compensation, as well as the deflationary c ross currents emanating from abroad --a subject to which I now turn."
"  Over the past 15 months , U.S. monetary policy deliberations have been taking place against a backdrop of progressively gloomier projections of global demand."
 The International Monetary Fund ( IMF) has marked down 2015 emerging market and world growth repeatedly  since April 2014.
"    In the second half of 2014 , persistently weak aggregate demand in Japan and  the Euro Area led to heightened deflationary pressures."
" The policy response to the se pressures and the anticipated divergence between the policy trajectory in these economies and the United States contributed to a 10 percent appreciation in the dollar in inflation -adjusted terms through the spring of this year, pushing down net exports and restraining activity in the United States."
" Net exports subtracted nearly 1 percentage point from the  - 7 - annual rate of  U.S. gross domestic product ( GDP ) growth in the first part of the year, and the most recent trade data suggest another substantial subt raction in the third quarter."
"  More recently, weakness in foreign demand has extended to emerging market economies , which now account for about half  of world output and have been an important source of growth  for more than the past decade."
"  Much of the focus has been on China, whose large size and doub ledigit growth rate put it at the center of a powerful global commodity super -cycle over the past decade ."
" Consequently, the challenges China faces today  are raising questions about emerging market growth prospects more broadly."
 Many commodity -exporting countries  that have depended heavily on Chinese demand are adjusting with difficulty to the recent sharp  commodity  price decline s.
" After increasing at an average rate of nearly 5 -1/2 percent over the period from 2003  through 2011, GDP growth in emerging market commodity exporters is projected to be only 3 -1/2 percent this year."
 Projected growth going forward has also be en marked down materially .
" Because of these ties, and for other idiosyncratic reasons, growth in East Asian economies has been weak so far this year."
" Growth in emerging Asia economies outside of  China that are important destinations of U.S. exports slipped to 2 -1/2 percent in the first half of the year, well below a trend rate of close to 5  percent."
  Downgrades to  foreign growth  affect the U.S. outlook through several channels.
" First, weak grow th abroad reduce s demand for U.S. exports."
" Second,  the expected divergence in  U.S. growth increases  demand for U.S. assets , putting upward pressure on the dollar , which, i n turn, weigh s on net exports ."
" The estimated effect of dollar appreciation on net e xports  has been shown to be substantial and to persist  for several years .6  Weak demand weigh s on global commodity prices , which , together with the effects on the dollar,  restrain s U.S. inflation."
"  Finally , the anticipation  of weaker global growth  can make  market participants more attuned to downside risks, which can reduce prices for risky assets, both abroad and in the U nited States--as we saw in late August --with attendant effects on consumption and investment."
" Output Growth in the Aftermath of the Commodity Boom,” chapter 2 of the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF, 2015) World Economic Outlook , available at www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2015/02/pdf/c2.pdf ."
" 6 Looking across a broad set of countries, the IMF (2015) estimates that a 10  percent appreciation in the real exc hange rate will cause an eventual 1.5 percentage point reduction in the contribution of net exports to real GDP, with  effects lasting for several years (see chapter 3, “Exchange Rates and Trade Flows:  Disconnected?” available at www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2015/02/pdf/c3.pdf )."
"        - 9 - Over  the past year, a feedback loop has transmitted market expectations of policy divergence between the U nited States and our major trade partners into financial tightening in the U.S. through exchange rate and financial market channels."
 A plausible baseline scenario might include a soft landing  in China and growth in other emerging markets moving gradually back up to underlying trends.
" Of course , it is possible that a recovery in emerging market growth occurs sooner than in  the baseline , such that the U.S economy moves modestly more quickly toward our goals."
" However, demand in emerging markets could also fall short of such a baseline."
" China is only pa rtway through challenging economic adjustments and financial market reforms, including reform of its exchange rate regime, debt deleveraging, and rebalancing of its economy toward more consumer -driven growth."
" A more negative assessment  of underlying Chinese growth fundamentals or its excha nge rate regime would likely affect other important economies in the region, as well as commodity -producing economies, pushing global demand down further."
" In turn, e xpectations of additional weakness in global demand could have  - 10 - important effects on the ex change rate of the dollar, the valuation of risky assets  in the United States , and U.S. inflation, moving the economy further from our goals."
"demand directly , or that the anticipation of a sharper divergence in U.S. policy could impose restraint through additional tightening of financial conditions."
  The asymmetry in risk management stems from the combination of the likel y low current level of the neutral real interest rate and the effective lower bound.
" Most FOMC participants  lowered their estimate of the appropriate target level for the federal funds rate in the long run, and a majority of participants  now forecast a level no higher than 3.62  percent --down from 4.12 percent in September 2012.9  A lower equilibrium funds rate implies a higher probability of policy being constrained by a lower bound for nominal interest rates ."
" From the perspective of risk management, in today’s circumstances, we have considerably greater latitude to a djust the path of policy in response to inflation that exceeds current forecasts than we have to provide additional accommodation in response to additional adverse shocks ."
"  - 12 - Because monetary policy acts with a lag,  in this scenario,  high rates of resource utilization may lead to a large buildup of inflationary pressures, a rise in inflation expectations and persistent inflation in excess of our 2 percent target."
"  Moreover, the persistently deflationary international environment, the gradual pace of increases in U.S. resource utilization, the estimated small effect of resource utilization on inflation, the likely low level of neutral interest rates, and the persistence of inflation below our 2 percent target suggests this risk remains modest ."
" Financial markets appear to agree, as five -year inflation compensation is well below 2 percent ."
" A further step -down in global demand growth and a further strengthening in the dollar could increase the already sizable negative effect  of the global environment on U.S. demand, pushing  U.S. growth back to, or below, potential."
 Progress toward full employment and 2 percent inflation would stall or reverse.
"  - 13 - To be fair, the past few years have demonstrated the capacity and will of central bank s in many  jurisdictions to deploy unconventional monetary policy tools , including quantitative and credit easing , forward guidance , and  negative rates."
  We should not take the continued st rength of domestic demand growth for granted .
" Although t he outlook for domestic demand is good, global forces are weighing on net exports and inflation, and the risks from abroad  appear tilted to the downside."
" Our economy has made good progress toward fu ll employment, but sluggish wage growth suggests there is some room to go,  and inflation has remained persistently below our target."
" With equilibrium real interest rates likely to remain low for some time and policy options that are more limited if condit ions deteriorate than if they accelerate, riskmanagement considerations counsel a stance  of waiting to see if the risks to the outlook   diminish ."
