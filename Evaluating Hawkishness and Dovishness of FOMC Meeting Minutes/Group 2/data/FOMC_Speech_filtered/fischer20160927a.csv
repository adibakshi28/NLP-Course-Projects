" The proportion of adults participating in the labor force --that is , either holding jobs or actively searching for employment --has declined substantially over the past decade."
" Millions of people lost their jobs , and many of them experienced great difficulty finding new employment."
" Other economists have put more emphasis on the effects of the reduction over time in the demand for lower -skilled labor.3  Indeed, the wages of high school graduates have fallen                                                  2 See Stephanie Aaronson, Tomaz Cajner, Bruce Fallick, Felix Galbis -Reig, Christopher Smith, and William Wascher (2014) , “Labor Force Participation:  Recent Developments and Future Prospects, ” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity  (Fall), pp."

" Many economists believe that the decline in demand for lower -skilled workers reflects technological changes.4  For instance, the introduction of information technology such as desktop computers may have boosted the wages of highly skilled workers by more than the wages of workers with fewer skills."
" The slump in demand for low erskilled labor likely also reflects the effects of globalization, including  competition from goods produced and imported from abroad.5 My second current question concerns economic mobility:  How likely is a child from a low -income family to move up to a higher income level as an adult?"

" Yet research conducted by economists as well as other social scientists suggests that a diversity of perspectives and ideas lead to better decisions and increased productivity.7  In my own experience, economic policy decisions are better when informed by a wide range of views and experiences."
