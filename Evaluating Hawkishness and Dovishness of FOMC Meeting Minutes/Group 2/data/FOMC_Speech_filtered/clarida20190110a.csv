"For release on delivery  7:00 p.m. E ST  January 10, 2019         Monetary Policy Outlook for 2019    Remarks by  Richard H."
" My resolution, as a member of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), is to work with my colleagues to implement a monetary policy  that will sustain economic growth and maximum employment at levels consistent with our 2 percent inflation objective.1   Initial Conditions and What I Am Looking for in 2019 As we begin 2019, the initial conditions for the real economy are favorable."
" Through the first three quarters of last year, gross domestic product growth averaged 3.2 percent."
" If so, economic growth in 2018 would be the fastest annual growth rate recorded in 13 years."
" In terms of the economic outlook, ongoing momentum heading into this year indicates that that above -trend growth is likely to continue in 2019."
" The labor market remains heal thy, with an unemployment rate near the lowest level recorded in 50 years and with average monthly job gains continuing to outpace the increases needed over the longer run to provide employment for new entrants to the labor                                                  1 The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of other Federal Reserve Board members or FOMC participants."
" Moreover, the declines i n the unemployment rate have been widespread across racial and ethnic minority groups, though gaps for African Americans and Hispanics relative to whites remain sizable."
" At 3.9 percent, the overall unemployment rate is below the median of FOMC participant s’ estimates of its full employment level , u*, of 4.4 percent."
" That said, the participants’ median estimate of u* has been falling for several years as strong employment gains have not triggered a worrying rise in price inflation."
" In a welcome developmen t, nominal wage growth is picking up, with most measures now running around 3 percent on an annual basis."
" And, for the past couple of years, wage gains have been notably faster for lower -income workers.2  Aggregate wage gains are broadly in line with productivity growth and our 2 percent inflation objective, and they are consistent with a labor market that is operating in the vicinity of full employment."
" They are not, at present, a source of upward, cost -push pressure on price inflation."
 And participation in the job market may                                                  2 Wage gains for workers with different wage levels can be calculated using data from the Current Population Survey from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

"   Price stability, of course, is the other leg of our dual mandate, and PCE (personal consumption expenditures) inflation over the past 12 months has been running close to our 2 percent objective."
" That said, and notwithstanding strong economic growth and a low unemployment rate, inflation has surprised to the downside recently, and it is not yet clear that inflation has moved back to 2 percent on a sust ainable basis."
"  Because expectations of future inflation are such an important determinant of actual inflation, central banks are as much in the business of anchoring inflation expectations as they are of managing actual inflation."
" Longer -run inflation e xpectations, based on straight readings of inflation compensation from TIPS (Treasury Inflation -Protected Securities), have drifted downward, although, when adjusted for term premiums and liquidity, they remain near 2 percent."
 T he University of Michigan S urveys of Consumers’ measure of expected inflation over the next 5 to 10 years has been broadly stable but has edged down over the past few years and is now at the very lower end of the range that has prevailed historically .
 Inflation expectations of prof essional forecasters have remained  stable and consistent with our 2 percent objective.
" At each future FOMC meeting, as I consider what, if any, adjustment to our policy stance is warranted to achieve and sustain our dual -mandate objectives, I will closely monitor the incoming data on inflation expectations as well as actual inflation , among the broad range of real and financial indicators that I consult ."
"I will also be monitoring closely the incoming data on labor supply and productivity.3  Not only has aggregate demand growth been robust, but so, too, has been the growth in realized aggregate supply."
" Over the first three qua rters of 2018, hours worked in the nonfarm business sector were up 2.0 percent (at an annual rate), and productivity was up 1.8 percent."
" Realized productivity growth over the past eight quarters has averaged 1.3 percent, which is up from the 0.7 percent a verage recorded between 2011 and 2016."
" Strong growth supported by supply -side gains in hours worked and productivity is not inflationary, as the experience of 2018 confirms."
" With labor supply and productivity growth in 2018 having surprised on the upside , some mean reversion in 2019 is not unreasonable to forecast."
" But right now, that is just a forecast, and if the positive developments on the supply side of the economy continue in 2019, they would need to be factored into the inflation outlook and thus the appropriate settings for monetary policy."
"  As I have indicated previously, I believe we may have seen the bottom on the productivity slowdown, but how much of the recent welcome uptick in productivity growth can be sustained or extended is hard to judge at this point."
" We saw a welcome pickup in investment in the first half of last year, but growth of                                                  3 For an analysis of the effect of a positive boost to productivity in the FRB/US model , see JeanPhilippe  Laforte  (2018) , “Overview of the Changes to the FRB/US Model  (2018), ” FEDS Notes (Washington:  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, December 7), f ig."
" In the model, higher productivity lowers inflation , whic h calls for a flatter path for policy normalization than would otherwise be the case ."
" If a pickup in the growth of investment spending was realized and s ustained, it would be expected to contribute  to future productivity growth."
"  The December Decision  and the Outlook for Monetary Policy in 2019 With a robust labor market and inflation running close to our 2 percent inflation objective, the Committee decid ed at its December meeting to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 2 -1/4 to 21/2 percent.4  That said, growth and growth prospects in other economies around the world have moderated somewhat in recent months, and overall financial conditio ns have tightened materially."
" If these crosswinds are sustained, appropriate forward -looking monetary policy should respond to keep the econom y as close as possible to our dual -mandate objectives of maximum employment and price stability.5  I will closely monitor the incoming data on                                                  4 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2018), “Federal Reserve Issues FOMC Statement,” press release, December 19, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20181219a.htm ."
" 5 In the model of optimal monetary policy discussed in a paper by Clarida, Gal í, and Gertler, the central bank is able to offset fully exogenous declines in aggregate demand through adjustments in the expected path for the policy rate."
"Clarida, Jordi Gal í, and Mark Gertler  (1999) , “The Science of Monetary Policy:  A N ew Keynesian Perspective,” Journal of Economic Literature, vol."
" While monetary policy in practice must confront  realworld complications that theoretical models ignore, the crucial point is that economic projections for growth and inflation under appropriate monetary policy may be much less affected by adverse or positive “demand” fluctuations than would be the cas e if policy did not respond appropriately to these developments."
" That is, under present circumstances and under appropriate monetary policy, one can be more optimistic about the economic outlook than would be a “pessimist” who focuses only on the crosswin ds without factoring in the appropriate policy response to the crosswinds."

" - 6 - these global economic and financial developments as, at each future FOMC meeting, I consider what adjustment to o ur monetary policy stance is warranted to achieve  and sustain our dual -mandate objectives."
" One defines r* as the level of the policy rate that, if sustained, would maintain full employment and price stability in the long run."
" First, we need to base our policy decisions on what trends in the data tell us about where the economy is at the time of each meeting relative to our dualmandate objectives for unemployment and inflation."
" Over the past seven years, FOMC participants have continually revised down their estimates of longrun u* and r* as the unemployment rate fell and historically low policy rates did not trigger a su rge in inflation and inflation expectations above target."
"Clarida (2018), “ Data Dependence and U.S. Monetary Policy, ” speech delivered at the Clearing House and the Bank Policy Institute Annual Conference, New York, November 27, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/clarida20181127a.htm ."
" With inflation muted, I believe that the Committee can afford to be patient  as we see how the data evolve in 2019 and as we assess what monetary policy stance is warranted to sustain strong growth and our dual -mandate objectives."
" In terms of monetary policy implementation, the FOMC is assessing how the demand for our liabilities, especially reserve balances held at the Fed by depository institutions and U.S. currency holdings, is evolving in a world in which regulation and prudence boost holdings of liquid assets by financial institutions."
  The FOMC is discussing the pros and cons of different longer -run approaches to monetary policy implementation and is still learning about the evolution of the demand for reserves in the banking system.
" As noted in the FOMC’s Policy Normalization Principles and Pla ns, the Committee i ntends to, in the longer run, hold “ no more  - 8 - securities than necessary to implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively .”7  In that vein, as indicated in the minutes from our recent meetings, the Committee has been weighing the costs and benefits of an implementation system with abundant reserves."
" However, while the assessment of our operating framework is ongoing, let me be clear that any decisions we make on the ultimate size of the balance sheet and the implementation of policy will be taken so as to be consistent with our goals of sustaining strong growth, maximum employment, and price stability."
"  Review of the Federal Reserve’s Strategy, Tools, and Communication  In November, the Federal Reserve announced that it will conduct a wide -ranging and public review in 2019 of how we go about achieving the twin goals of maximum employment and price stability assigned to us by the Congress."
" The review will cover the  Fed’s monetary policy strategy, policy tools, and communication practices and will include outreach to businesses, community groups, academics, and other interested parties."
" As Chairman Powell has indicated, with labor market conditions close to maximum employment and inflation near our 2 percent objective, now is a good time to                                                  7 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System  (2014), “Federal Reserve Issues FOMC Statement on Policy Normalization  Principles and Plans,”  press release, September 17 , paragraph 9, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20140917c.htm ."
"  - 9 - take stock of how the Federal Reserve formulates, conducts, and communicat es monetary policy."
" Beginning in the summer of 2019, the FOMC will draw on what it has learned from the conference and the System outreach events as it assesses possible ways in which the Fed’s strategy, tools, and communication practices might evolve to best achieve, on a sustained basis, the twin goals of maximum employment and price stability assigned to it by the Congress."
" Concluding Thoughts  The U.S. economy enters 2019 after  a year of strong growth, with inflation near our 2 percent objective, and with the unemployment rate near 50year lows."
" That said, growth and growth prospects in other economies around the world have moderated somewhat in recent mont hs, and overall financial conditions have tightened materially."
" If these crosswinds are sustained, appropriate forward -looking monetary policy should seek to offset them to keep the economy as close as possible to our dual -mandate objectives of maximum employment and price stability."
" As we have long said, monetary policy is not on a preset course."
"  - 10 - For example, were models to predict a surge in inflation, a decision for preemptive hikes before the surge is evident in actual  data would need to be balanced against the cost of the model being wrong."
