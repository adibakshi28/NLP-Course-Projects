"For release on delivery  12:15 p.m. EDT  October 18, 2018          Don’t Chase the Needles:    An Optimistic  Assessment of the Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy     Remarks by   Randal K."
" In particular, I will explain how my views on potential growth help shape my outlook, both for the economy and for the appropriate path of monetary policy."
" Gross domestic product increased a robust 31/4 percent in the first half of the year, and indicators suggest continued strong growth through the summer."
 Economic conditions are as close to meeting the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate for monetary policy --maximum sustainable employment and price stability --as they have been in a long time.
" Inflation is in line with the Committee’s 2 percent objective, and the unemployment rate is at nearly a 50 -year low."
     How long can this strong growth be sustained?
 The ans wer depends largely on what form growth takes.
 Growth that is supported by increases in the productive capacity of the economy should be durable.
" However, if growth primarily reflects strong demand that stretches production beyond its sustainable capacit y, the economy will run into constraints that will result in slower growth, higher prices, or a potentially destabilizing buildup of financial imbalances."
"That said, I see many reasons to be optimistic about the growth of the potential capacity of the economy over the next few years."

  - 3 - view that many of the factors that have been weighing on potential growth since the  financial crisis could be lifting.
" The  growth of potential can, at the most basic level, be broken down into two factors:  the supply of labor and the productivity of that labor."
" Productivity, in turn, is importantly affected by changes in the stock of capital --that is, machines and factories --as well as technological advances and improved production methods."
" For some time, the contribution of the labor  force to potential growth has been held down by the predictable dra g of baby boomers moving into retirement."
" Thus , I think there is  some potential for labor force participation to move up, perhaps as workers respond to the  incentives of plentiful job opportunities and higher wages, thereby  adding to the productive capacity of the economy and pushing back the constraints on growth."
" For example, the two -decadelong trend increase in the population not in the labor force on account of disability peaked in 2014 and has started to move down quite rapidly --again , for reasons that defy easy explanation  but may reflect the general improvement in labor  market opportunities .3 I will now turn to productivity ."
" Labor productivity has  averaged an annual growth rate of only 3/4 percent since 2011, far below the 21/4 percent pace that prevailed in the two decades before the financial crisis."
" Although there are competing theories, the productivity decline is not well understood, and a consensus explanation has yet to emerge."
"  The most recent data have been moving in the right direction, but only haltingly, with labor productivity increasing about 11/4 percent over the past year."
  There are reasons that productivity growth could shake off some of its recent torpidity.
 I t might be that the productivity gains associated with th ese and other new technologies are embo died in new capital equipment and will only now start to become apparent as the investment drought of recent years comes to an end .
 Whether this performance is sustained will be importantly determined by whether growth is supported by increases in the economy’s potential.
" I am hopeful that potential growth, and particularly productivity, could accelerate from its relatively a nemic pace of late, sustaining growth without overheating the economy."
" The more the economy’s potential growth increases, the more gradual we can be in our removal of monetary policy accommodation."
" Thus, an assessment of the pace of potential growth will  be an important input into what I view as the appropriate path of policy to achieve our objectives of maximum sustainable  employment and price  stability."
" Traditionally, as taught in Econ 101, inflation provides a signal on whether the economy is operating above or below its potential level."
" If inflat ion moves up in a sustained manner, not just because of temporary shocks, then the economy is likely operating above its productive capacity , as firm s have the leeway to raise prices given  the strength  - 6 - of demand."
" Likewise, if inflation moves down persistently , then the economy is likely  operating with  some  slack , as firms restrain  prices to sell their products  in the face of weak demand."
"    If inflation is the primary indicator  of the economy’s  position relative to  potential, how confident can we be in the quality of the signal?"
" It has been noted-- quite frequently, I might add-- that the relationship between inflation and the  tightness of the economy has gotten weaker, which is to say that inflation appears to be less affected by movements in econo mic slack or tightness, traditionally measured by the unemployment rate, than in the past."
" As the role of slack in explaining inflation has diminished, inflation expectations have assumed greater importance."
" However, it is reasonable to ask , if inflation  is, in fact, now largely a reflection of inflation expectations, is inflation still a good indicator of the cyclical state of the economy?"
" Or, more directly, can we count on inflation to warn us  in time if the economy is overheating?"
" To be a little contr oversial, perhaps what we are witnessing with inflation is an application of what has been called Goodhart’s law, named after Charles Goodhart, the distinguished scholar of central banking at the London S chool of E conomics.4  The law can be summarized as  the idea that if an indicator becomes a target of policy, that indicator loses its value as a gauge of the state of the economy."
"   - 7 - Something along these lines could be happening to inflation, especially given the important role of expected inflation in the behavior of actual inflation."
 Perhaps inflation is just sending a signal of people’s  trust in the Fed ’s ability to meet its inflation objective.
" Ho wever, a problem does arise if the Fed  remain s reliant on inflation as our only  gauge of the economy’s  position relative to its  potential."
" Anchored inflation expectations might mask the inflation signal coming from an overheated economy for a period, but I have no doubt that prices would eventually move up in response to resource constraints."
" The ultimate price,  from the perspective of the dual mandate, would be an unanchoring of inflation expectations."
" As I have said, I  am optimistic about potential growth, and  I expect that even relatively s trong growth can be met  without running into economic constraints ."
" However, I also think that we should pay attention to other indicators of tightness  and overheating in addition to inflation ."
" There are other signs of potential beside s inflation, includi ng, but not limited to, direct measures of labor utilization or indications of shortages and bottlenecks in production."
    Policy Considerations  How should these thoughts affect monetary policy?
" But I have noted as well that there may be reason to think that  - 8 - resource constraints could be more binding  than current inflation measures would traditionally indicate , which would call for a more athletic response."
" Moreover, there is today a higher degree of uncertainty about many of these factors --measures of labor slack, the relation between labor slack and inflation, the sensitivity of current inflation measures to actual resource constraints, and the future growth of productivity, to name a few--than there has been for many years."
Today uncerta inty around many of the macroeconomic inputs to monetary policy decisions argues for just the same approach to navigation.
" Put another way, while I think that there is enough reason to think that the productive capacity of our economy  might be increasing  so that we should not feel compelled to accelerate our pace, I also think there is enough doubt about current  - 10 - inflation as an infallibly reliable measure of current resource constraints that  the continued gradual removal of accommodation is appropriate."
