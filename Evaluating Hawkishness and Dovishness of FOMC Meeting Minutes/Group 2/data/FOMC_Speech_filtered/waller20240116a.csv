"  In the second half of 2023, I gave a series of speeches about the apparent conflict between the strength of economic activity in the third quarter and continued progress toward the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) 2 percent inflation goal.1  I said then that “something’s got to give” —either activity needs to moderate, or progress o n lowering inflation  is going to stop."
" By late November, the latest economic data left me encouraged that there were signs of moderating economic activity in the fourth quarter, but inflation was still too high."
" Real gross domestic product (GDP)  is expected to have grown between 1  and 2 percent  in the fourth quarter , unemployment is still below 4  percent, and core personal consumption expenditure (PCE) inflation has been running close to 2 percent for the last 6 months."
  Time will tell whether inflation can  be sustained  on its recent path and allow us to conclude  that we have achieved the FOMC’s pricestability goal.
"Let me start with the data on economic activity that has brought me to this view , and then I’ll talk about the labor market , financial conditions,  and inflation."
 I’ll conclude with w hat I think the implications are from all that for monetary policy.
" First, economic activity has moderated."
" After averaging an annualized 3 percent over the first three quarters of 2023, and 5 percent in the third quarter, growth in real GDP appears to have slowed appreciably in the fourth quarter."
" An important part of that moderation  comes from business investment and government spending, both of which showed rapid growth earlier in 2023 that didn’t appear sustainable."
" Consumer spending also accounted for much of the surprising strength in GDP growth earlier in the year, but here the slowdown so far appears more tentative."
" Factors such as high interest rates, a depletion of excess savings, and a pickup in credit card usage all portend slower growth ahead, but it is unclear how much of that slowing has already occurred."
" Since  consumer spending accounts for more than twothirds of GDP, this component of demand is obviously critical for the outlook."
"  Turning to the labor market, over the course of 2023, there have been increases in labor supply a mid slowing demand for labor , and I expect this to continue to bring the labor market into better balance."
  The short version is that I see the surprises in the December job s report as largely noise against a trend o f ongoing moderation that supports progress toward 2 percent inflation.
" The unemployment rate in December held steady at 3.7 percent while employers added 216,000 jobs, which was more than expected and an increase from the 173,000 created in November and 105,000 in October."
" While that looks like a modest  acceleration in job creation, I remind myself that revisions to monthly payrolls have been downward for most of 2023 —from the first to the third estimate employment gains were revised down in 9 of 10 job reports."
" Furthermore, with growth expectations moderating over coming quarters, employment gains are likely to slow."
 This data shows an improving balance between l abor supply and demand.
"Likewise, an uptick in wage growth last month should be viewed over a longer time horizon."
" But over the course of the fourth quarter, wages rose less than they did in the third quarter , and over the past several quarters I see a moderation in wage increases across various measures of labor compensation that I expect will be consistent with ongoing progress toward 2 percent inflation."
" Meanwhile, data on job openings indicates ongoing moderation in labor demand."
 Job openings played a prominent role in my thinking over the last two years about how restrictive monetary policy aimed at bringing down inflation will impact labor demand and unemployment.
 One can think of total labor demand as being the sum of the number of workers employed and the number of workers that firms want to hire.
" If labor demand declines , the question is : Will employment bear the brunt of the reduction in demand or will vacancies absorb the impact?"
" Traditional Phillips curve analysis assumes  that emplo yment would bear the brunt and as a result, unemployment would rise significantly from a tightening of monetary policy."
 It just seemed counterintuitive to me that with that many job openings and so few people looking for work that the first thing a firm would do when labor demand softened would be to lay off workers.
" My economic instinct was that this time things would be different and that  vacancies would absorb the decline in labor demand, while employment and unemployment  changed relatively little."
" This is   what I provided in a speech I gave in May 2022, with the help of Andrew Figura .2  In that speech  we described  a textbook labor search model to derive a Beveridge curve, which is a theoretical relationship between job vacancies and the unemployment rate.3  To quantify the effects of restrictive monetary policy on unemployment , we used standard empirical methods to calibrate the theoretical model."
" We showed that if restrictive monetary policy could lower the vacancy rate from 7.5 percent  to 4.5 percent via a significant decline in job vacancies, there would be a relatively small increase in  the unemployment rate —from 3.7 percent  to 4.2 percent ."
" Based on this analysis, we  argued that, as long as the involuntary jobseparation  rate did not rise,  restrictive monetary policy would allow the FOMC  to bring inflation down without a significant increase in the unemployment rate."
" Since March 2022, the FOMC raised the policy rate over 500 basis points and core PCE inflation has fallen substantially , especially when measured over the past six months ."
"Waller (202 2), “Responding to High Inflation, with Some Thoughts on a Soft Landing, ” speech delivered at the Institute for Monetary and Financial Stability (IMFS) Distinguished Lecture, Goethe University Frankfurt, Germany, May 30."
" Meanwhile the unemployment rate , while bouncing around a bit, is the same as it was in March 2022, 3.7 pe rcent, which is lower than we predicted."
5 percent  there would be a significant increase in the unemployment rate.
" Moving on from the labor market, a nother important factor affecting economic activity and progress toward the FOMC’s economic objectives is financial conditions, and I wanted to give  my view of where th ey stand."
" My view continues to be that, on net, financial conditions remain restrictive and continue to have the desired effect of being a drag on economic activity to put downward pressure on inflation."
  Recall that the 10 -year Treasury yield peak ed in mid -October a round 5 percent  at the time of the jump up in measured economic activity in the third quarter and shortly after a strong jobs report for September.
" I consider this to still be true today, and that judgment is supported by current  readings of financial conditions indexes, which capture a broader set of financial variables.4  So let’s talk about what the data on economic activity, the labor market  and financial conditions  mean for progress toward 2 percent inflation."
 The backdrop is that we made a lot of progress on inflation in 2023.
" Factoring out volatile energy and food prices, core inflation is a better guide to where inflation is going, and core PCE inflation fell from 5 percent in January  to 3.2 percent in November."
" With inflation declining over the course of the year, I like to look at 3and 6month measures to have a better understanding of the current level of inflation ."
" As I noted earlier, the 6 -month change in core inflation has been hovering close to a 2 percent  annual rate, as has the 3month measure ."
Data on inflation for December was released last week for the consumer price index (CPI)  and producer price index .
 CPI inflation  for both total and core rose 0.3 percent for the month.
 P roducer price index (PPI) inflation numbers reported a continued decline in those prices.
" Some of the  PPI data  feed into December PCE inflation , and  private sector forecasts suggest that the monthly core PCE reading will be 0.2 percent ."
" The Federal Reserve’s Financial Conditions Impulse on Growth index also shows a downward movement from its pea k earlier in 2023, and its level continues to suggest that conditions are a headwind to economic activity."
"       those forecasts hold true, then core PCE inflation in December will remain  close to 2 percent , when measured on a 3month or 6month  basis."
"   PCE inflation of 2 percent is our goal, but that goal cannot be achieved for just a moment in time."
" As I said  earlier , based on economic activity and the cooling of the labor market, I am becoming more confident that we are within striking distance of achieving a sustainable level of 2 percent  PCE inflation."
"  I think we are clos e, but I will need more information in the coming months confirming or (conceivably) challenging the notion that inflation is moving d own sustainably toward our inflation goal."
  This brings me to the implications for monetary policy.
"  The progress I have noted on inflation, combined with the data in hand on economic and financial conditions and my outlook has made me more confident than I have been since 2021  that inflation is on a path to 2 percent."
" While the emphasis of policy since that time has been on pushing down inflation, given the strength of the current labor market  the FOMC’s focus now  is likely to be more balanced: keeping inflation on a  2 percent path while also keeping employment near its maximum level."
" Today, I view the risks to our employment and inflation mandates as being more close ly balanced."
 I will be watching for sustained progress on inflation and modest cooling in the labor market that does not harm the economy.
 It is restrictive and should continue to put downward pressure on demand to allow us to continue to see moderate inflation readings.
" So, as I said, I believe we are on the right track  to achieve 2 percent inflation."
"    As long as inflation doesn’t  rebound and stay elevated, I believe the FOMC will be able  to lower  the target range for the federal funds rate this year ."
" R isks that would delay or dampen my expectation for cuts this year are that economic activity that seems to have moderated in the fourth quarter of 2023 does not play out ; that the balance of supply and demand in the labor market, which improved over 2023, stops improving or reverses ; and that the gains on moderating inflation evaporate."
  One piece of data I will be watching closely is the scheduled revisions to CPI inflation due next  month.
" Recall that a year ago, when it looked like inflation was coming down quickly, the  annual update to the seasonal factors erased those gains."
" In midFebruary, we will get the January CPI report and revisions for 2023, potential ly changing the picture on inflation."
" This cycle, however, with economic activity and labor markets in good shape and inflation coming down gradually to 2 percent , I see  no reason to move as quickly or cut as rapidly as in the past ."
