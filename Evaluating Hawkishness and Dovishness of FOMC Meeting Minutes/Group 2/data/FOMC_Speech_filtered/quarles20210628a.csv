" The dollar’s role in the global economy rests on a number of foundations, including the  - 7 - strength and size of the U.S. economy;  extensiv e trade linkages between the United States and the rest of the world ; deep financial markets , including for U.S. Treasury securities;  the stable value of the dollar over time ; the ease of converting U.S. dollars into foreign currencies ; the rule of law and strong property rights in the U nited States ; and last but not least, credible U.S. monetary policy."
" For example, how would widespread adoption of stablecoins affect monetary policy  or financial stability ?"
 All of these factors create “run risk”  —the possibility that some trigger ing event could cause a large number of stablecoin holders to exchange their coins all at once for other assets and that the stablecoin system would not be able to meet such demands while maintaining a reasonabl y stable value.
