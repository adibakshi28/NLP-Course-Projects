  Outlook and Monetary Policy  Congress assigned the Federal Reserve the job of promoting maximum employment and price stability.
" The unemployment rate is 3.7 percent, a 49year low , and many other measures of labor market strength are at or near historic bests."
 Inflation  is near our 2 percent target.
"  For seven years d uring the  crisis and  its painful aftermath , the F ederal O pen Market C ommittee (FOMC) kept our  policy interest rate unprecedentedly low --in fact, near zero --to support the economy as it struggled to recover."
"  Interest rates are still low by historical stan dards , and they remain  just below the broad range of estimates of the level that would be neutral for the economy --that is, neither speeding up nor slowing down growth."
" My FOMC colleagues and I, as well as many private -sector  economists, are forecasting continued solid growth, low unemployment, and inflation near 2 percent."
 Our gradual pace of raising interest rates has been an exercise in balancing risks.
 We also know that moving too slowly--keeping interest rates too low for too long --could risk other distortions in the form of higher inflation or destabilizing financial imbalances.

" Further, t he upward trend in recent years appears broadly consistent with the growth in business assets relati ve to GDP."
