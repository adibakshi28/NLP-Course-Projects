"Recent Economic Developments  Following the sharp downturn in 2008 a nd the first half of  2009, real economic activity has now been expanding for more th an two years (chart 1)."
" To be sure, economic growth in the first half of last year  was depressed by some transitory factors, including high energy prices a nd the effects of the tragic  earthquake in Japan on the production of motor vehicles."
" Still, even as these influences on the economy waned over the second half of 2011, economic activity  appears to have increased at only a moderate pace."
" In recent months, there have been glim mers of hope seen in the job market."
" For example, payroll employment rose 200,000 in December and the unemployment rate, which had hovered around 9 percent for most of the year, fell to 8.5 percent, a rate that while still far too high was the lowest in 21/2 years (chart 3) ."
" That said, other economic data have improved more modestl y, and the bulk of the evidence, including helpwanted advertising and surveys of empl oyers’ hiring plans, suggests that the job market is not poised for marked improvement in the months ahead."
" That said, there are some reasons not to  get too optimistic about this  sector of the economy:  Many of the underlying forces that typically support consumer spending are still quite weak, including the high unemp loyment rate, sluggish income growth, sentiment that remains relatively low despite recent improve ments (chart 5), and the lingering effects of the earlier declines in household wealth."
 The declines in state and local government expenditures reflect cont inuing cutbacks in both employment and construction outlays.
" In the third qua rter, the annualized growth rate  of exports of domestically produced goods and services was about 5 perc ent, while net exports--that is, exports less imports--contributed nearly on e half of a percentage poin t to the increase in real GDP, about onefourth of the overall gain (cha rt 12)."
" - 4 - Turning to inflation, after a surge early last year, the price index for personal consumption expenditures decelerated consid erably toward the end of the year and rose at an annual rate of just 1/4 percen t in the three months ending in November (chart 13)."
" The Economic Outlook   Looking forward, my baseline forecast is for economic activity to gradually pick up steam over the next year  or so."
"  For example, with sluggish employment growth, household income may not be strong enough to support sustained increases in consumer spending."
 Government spending wi ll likely continue to be a drag on economic growth going forward.
" And, as I said earlier, a weak  forecast for global growth indicates that net exports may provide less support to  the U.S. recovery going forward."
"  As a result, most banks are now actively seeking loan growth to improve their profitability."
"  While unusually high chargeoffs tell part  of the declining ho usehold debt story, a dropoff in new loans--resulting from both tepid loan demand and tight loan supply--likely played a larger role."
" Loan de mand weakened during the recession as households delayed purchasing houses and consumer goods because of rising unemployment, weak income growth, and the steep declines in household wealth."
" But, even here, fewer loan officers reported reducing credit card limits and raising credit card  interest rates relative to their cost of funds."
" For example, auto purchases seem to be especially good candidates for surprise as the average age of cars on the road indicate s pentup demand and credit is readily accessible."
" Moreover, as households gain confidence that job and income prospects are improving, that should provide a furt her boost to spending and loan demand."
" Monetary accommodation works, in part, by lowering interest rates, increasing equity prices, and bolstering the availability of  - 8 -credit for households and firms."
" During a downturn, reduced spending on durable goods--including housing--generates pentup demand, which in itself helps sow the seeds of recovery."
" Once the cycle botto ms out, improving economic prospects and diminishing uncertainty usually help unl eash this pentup demand."
" This upward demand pressure is often augmented by lowe r interest rates, to which housing demand  - 9 -is typically quite responsive."
" Moreover, spillovers from increased housing demand--such as wealth effects from higher hous e prices, purchases of complementary goods such as furniture and appliances, as well as strengthening bank balance sheets--have, in the past, provided a powerful a dditional impetus to the recovery."
" Without equity in their homes, many households who have suffered hardships su ch as unemployment or unexpected illness have been unable to resolve mortgage payment problems through refinancing their mortgages or selling their homes."
 The failure of home  sales to respond to conditions that would otherwise seem favorable to home purchase s indicates that there are other factors weighing on demand for owneroccupied hom es.
 High levels of unemployment and weak income prospects are likely pr ecluding many households from purchasing homes.
" Although government programs have facilitated refi nancing for many borrowers, many others have still not benefited from the low levels of interest rates."
"  At the same time that housing demand ha s weakened, the number of homes for sale is elevated relative to historical norms , due in large part to the swollen inventory of homes held by banks, guarantors, and se rvicers after completion of foreclosure proceedings."
"Given the severity of problems with supply and demand in the housing market, it is unlikely that any single policy soluti on will provide the full answer, but a number of different policies each have the potent ial to yield incremental improvement in housing and economic recovery."
" It contains discussions  of a number of policie s that I believe, if implemented effectively, could resu lt in better economic performance.4  For example, policies that increase credit availability for homeowners or investors seeking to purchase a home or to refinance an existing mortgage would allow more borrowers to access lower interest  rates and thus improve the transmission of monetary policy to the economy."
" For example, in many housing markets the demand for rental housing is much stronge r relative to supply than in the market for owneroccupied homes."
" Although there is no miracle cure here, these actions have th e potential to help th e economy recuperate more quickly than I currently  expect it to, moving us closer to full employment sooner and improving the lives of many Americans."
 My forecast is for the unemployment rate to gradually (and perh aps fitfully) move lower and for inflation to settle over coming quarters at or below le vels consistent with the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate.
" In this environment, I belie ve that the current stance of monetary policy is appropriate."
