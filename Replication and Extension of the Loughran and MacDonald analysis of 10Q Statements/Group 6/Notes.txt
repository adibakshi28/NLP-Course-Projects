In this project, I was able to find a useful package called sec_edgar_downloader(in sec-download.py), which helped me to download the 10Q reports for the S&P 500 Companies. However, for some reason it only downloaded 3 reports every year instead of 4 reports, therefore, I only have around 7500 files of 10Q reports. The reason I decided to not fix it is because 7500 files already costed 100gb of storage and a lot of time, and I think the result would not have much difference to the 10000 files. Then I used Generic_Parser.py to output an file called 10Q_TFIDF_ProportionWeight.csv, which contains the tfidf and term weight for each 10Q report. Next, I used my return.py to find all the 4 days and 3 days excess return for each of the 10Q report and combine the data into a file called 10Q_TFIDF_ExcessReturns.csv. Finally I used that data to plot the graph called Figure 1.png. There are other steps I did such as find the cik of S&P 500 companies, and then find their permno code for CRSP database use.
